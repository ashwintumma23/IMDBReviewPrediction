Terrible Movie for Dictator Propaganda	Lulea	This shameful movie is about how government of Turkey is run by idealist. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. They not only change real events to their fantasy world conditions, they also used deceased engineers for their own propaganda.This movie is 2015 edition of Triumph of Will by Nazi Germany. I hope everybody will remember terrible people involved with this movie and cast them out from society. P.S. Did you know this movie is screened for free to the audiences by government with tax payers money? Shame on anybody who watches this crap.	1
If you want to make propaganda, at least make a good one	Turkey	A really horrible film which only aims to increase support for the idiotic things the government did and will do. It implies that almost every bad event happened in the past 10-15 years is because of a terrorist organization which works together with CIA, Mossad etc. It is so idiotic that it shows the gezi protests like something that was controlled behind a screen by the same organization (which clearly doesn&#x27;t exist) What can I say, if you are stupid enough to believe these things (unfortunately many people are) you may like the film but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s a poorly written and pathetically directed propaganda and a decent director could do something better while he&#x27;s in the toilet.	1
This so-called movie is a propaganda !	United States	Shame on the directors, the purpose of this so-called movie is clearly politically motivated. The intention smells very bad a political propaganda reminding Goebbels. The movie presents the main non-fictional character Erdogan as a victim of a corruption case. North-Korea propaganda style. Many scenes are from political meeting where Erdogan shows an awful populism. Even the trailer is bad. Anyone can watch Erdogan lies on youtube instead of watching this movie. I would rate zero if that was possible. Keep your eyes away from that. Better to watch &#x22;the interview&#x22; which is at least a good comedy. Regards RK	1
Terrible movie	None	Really awful. Don&#x27;t waste your time. if even they give you money to watch it you will regret and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer. There is no subject on that movie I was lucky I didn&#x27;t pay because it was free I mean cinema was free. Can you imagine they put this movie free so. Ratings will be high. But I said even 10000 lira you will never take your hours back. I prefer to go and watch horse race or ice skating rather then this fully rubbish movie.i could sit and do nothing and still I will be more happy that hours than spend hours watching this thing. I mean who wrote this? Do they have a mind? Really? And how could you accept a role as a actor in such a ridiculous movie? Are you OK? Please tell me? Why did you do that to us? Why ?	1
awful	United Kingdom	This was the awful movie I have ever watched in my life.Please tell me how it&#x27;s possible to formally review a film titled K.O.Z.Do not watch it. It is an absolute waste of time. It was also too boring. Also I paid 10 TL it was a waste of money. Than I heard that one of Turkish Political party giving tickets to its members for free. Highly political movie . It was produced in order to support the views of a political party. Also the the actors and actresses are not acting very well. I have never seen them before. Very small budget movie.This film is sure madness; a mess of epic proportions with so many odd features, amateur features, wooden acting, and loose ends that should technically derail the picture but, for some reason, do not. This is a charismatic film. One that doesn&#x27;t allow itself to exercise more than what it is. It&#x27;s silly, never boring, and embraces badness with a sense of lax, carefree fun.	1
Worst propaganda film ever!	Sweden	This is presumably the worst propaganda film ever shot in the entire history of cinema. It gives a highly biased and re-written account of the recent political corruption scandals in Turkey; the so-called 17-25 December corruption and bribery investigations in the year of 2013. What happened in reality was that, despite obvious evidence, the barefaced government officials including the back-then prime minister (the current president of the republic) insisted to call the investigations as a coup d&#x27;etat, and produced a surrealistic storyline to cover the allegations. The film intends to prove the unbelievable and mind-blowing theses of the government. I admit, though, it would&#x27;ve been fun to watch for those who know the true storyline. Nevertheless, it is painful for me to watch it as I am a Turkish citizen and it reflects the unfortunate fate of my lovely country. The film is now free to see at certain cinemas in Turkey. Even worse is that employees of some pro-government firms are forced to go see the film.Do not ever spend your precious time to see this rubbish film! (unless you&#x27;re researching on contemporary propaganda cinema :)	1
awful movie. dont waste your time.	england	This shameful movie is about government crimes. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. To hide their crimes, They say some people are betrayer. they also used deceased engineers for their own propaganda. People should not watch this movie to support human rights. Did you know this movie is screened for free to the audiences by government with tax payers money? Shame on anybody who watches this movie. If you want to support dictator governments and want to waste your money you may go to this movie. Please offer your friends that they should not watch this movie because of awful scenario. This movie really awful and my advice is to share this comment with your friends.	1
Deserves to be the worst movie in the world	Turkey	If anybody is curious about this movie and wonders why there are so many negative comments about it, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the &#x22;WORST&#x22; movie ever, I mean it. It&#x27;s completely waste of time, don&#x27;t even spend your time to watch it if you still haven&#x27;t. This movie itself is the proof of how much Turkey resembles Nazi Germany nowadays. Since Gezi protests shown the world how &#x22;delusional&#x22; Erdogan is, his only trump card (&#x22;koz&#x22; in Turkish, I mean &#x22;K.O.Z.&#x22;) is now telling lies to people about how aggrieved and &#x22;Muslim&#x22; he is, however, at the same time, doing everything he can to utterly destroy his dissidents, even promoting civil war in order to do so. By the way, this movie would be less terrible if Necati Sasmaz (Polat Alemdar) took part in it. After all, he is able to dodge a bullet by simply crouching down...	1
The lies of a dictator	Istanbul	This movie is on Turkish Televisions everyday. Same fictional stories, same lies... Everyday we see internal mails from the employees of the close to government companies in which the managers threaten the employees to go to this movie and bring back the ticket if they want to keep their job. Turkey is passing through very rough times these days with its fascist government. This movie is trying to cover the billion dollars this government and their families stole (which are proved with many legal tapes, photos and voice recordings but darkened); trying to hide the innocent civilians they killed and trying to hide the evil leading the country. What is fortunate about this film for the Turkish people is that it is so bad. It is horrible and therefore no one will ever watch it in Turkey or abroad. It would have been a good movie with horrible lies but instead it is a bad movie with horrible lies...	1
this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT!	Turkey	WARNING: curse words This is such a shitty movie for several reasons: * This movie is produced only to lie about AKP government&#x27;s false policies, theft and murders. Such as; letting Iranian spies to occupy the intelligence agency of Turkey (MIT), hiding huge bribery (%10 of every business built in Turkey goes to the president of Turkey, RTE), and killing innocent people against their benefit - like the politician Muhsin Yazcolu, and so on.* This movie is produced with the money of AKP government. They gathered the money from the bribery %10 of everything, then pour it into a financial &#x22;pool&#x22;. They support the newspapers, TV channels and a shitty movie like this with this money.* This movie is produced by an ideology, very similar to ISIS. They attack the very foundation of Islam by so-called representing it in this way of pressing, cursing, undermining, and killing - if necessary - all the people oppose to them.* ...the more I continue, the more I have to think of their rotten system. This makes me sick already.To sum up, this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT!	1
do not waste your time and money	konya	This is an ugly movie. It is about government crimes.Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. It is boring. It has nothing to do a nice movie. Do not watch it. It is an absolute waste of time. Actually you do not need to pay Money, because if you go to an Ak p party Office, They will give you a free ticket for this movie.But even in this case, it is an absolute waste of your time. This movie is a total disaster, in terms of story, technical-spectrum&#x27;s.Poor acting. etc. And everyone, probably even the real dictator himself even agrees with this but who cares?.&#x22;hail for fuhrer!&#x22; he and king&#x27;s all men order.	1
IMDb please add no star option	New York	Dear IMDb! please add a no star option cause if I give this film one star this will be an insult for the films which deserve one star. This is the worst and most disinformatic film I ever watched in my life. Please surf on facebook chatting with friends or what instead of watching this film cause it really really full of lyings and I and the people of Turkey is sure that this film is ordered by the current government of Turkey ruled by dictator Erdogan and the government even can put you in prison if you have a poll company and the resutl of you poll is against the gov. There are a lot of journalist are in prison in Turkey that there sine is to write against the gov. And there are hundereds of legal sound and video recording of Erdogan and his ministers that are particpiating in the Turkey&#x27;s big corruption in the history, instead of answering for their corruption they put the polices in jail. and the government bought more than 90% of the media and even republic media are used actively against the people in Turkey and in this situation how can you believe this film that when asked the director about the film that is biased, he answered that I have chosen my side. Long Live Tolerance, dialogue and peace in the world.	1
Turkish taxpayers money gone to waste!	New Orleans, LA	Total waste of time. It is so obvious that the movie was commissioned by Erdogan&#x27;s corrupt putinesque regime. This could be shown in schools as an example of mass media utilization by an authoritarian government a la Hitler or Stalin.Apparently, they can&#x27;t sell virtually any tickets, so it is shown for free in many places.The film portrays Erdogan as the victim of a so-called &#x27;global conspiracy&#x27;, and this whole project seems to be an attempt to maintain his voter base, which his party started to lose after the recent corruption scandals about him and his family.	1
Mein Kampf	Germany	This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It is an analogous to Adolf&#x27;s &#x22;Mein Kampf&#x22;. Turkish Prime Minister lives in a psychotic mood. So does his inner circle. Kleptocracy is a good word that describes the Turkish government today. Crony capitalism takes over market economy, and country&#x27;s economy shrinks everyday. Erdogan tries to disguise the corruption scandals that were unearthed between 17-25 December, 2013. I heard that Turkish government subsidizes this movie, so that people can go to theaters and watch it for free. Overall, this movie depicts the shallow vision of the current corrupt and populist government.	1
Propaganda of a Fallling Fascist Regime	u.s.a	This movie is a just propaganda tool of the Fascist Erdogan&#x27;s regime. Like all fascists and their supporters who have no ability to use cognitive skills and creativity, Producers did a terrible job. Theme is stupid, actors played incredibly terrible. There is nothing related to art of film making. Just a propaganda of totalitarian regime. Fortunately, they are even bad in propaganda compared with previous totalitarian regimes. All public in Turkey employees are being either forced or encouraged to go this movie. Free sessions of this movie are available all over Turkey. One should ask this question when evaluating this movie. if you do not aim profit from this movie, how did producers finance it? The answer is obvious: from poor Turkish people wallets. Fascist Erdogan regime financed this movie. You should see free movie just for understand a Government(Erdogan&#x27;s) could be such a miserable.Erdogan&#x27;s regime are demonizing the biggest social movement in Turkey, the Gulen movement, through this movie because Erdogan wants to control all Turkey. Briefly, this movie is just an unsuccessfull attempt of totalitarian regime for demonizing ideological enemies.	1
Deserves less than 1 star	Istanbul, Turkey	Actually even 1 star out of 10 is too much for this horrible film. The movie is a propaganda of tayyip erdogan, who I think is a dictator. The worst thing about the movie though, is not the bad acting, or for that matter the inane plot or over the top acting, it is the main subject itself. I am wondering why tayyip erdogan didn&#x27;t act himself in the movie. Whoever made this film had a lot of cash, to bag all those actors/actresses to star in it. Now all of them wish they hadn&#x27;t starred in it, I bet they all deny they are in it, it&#x27;s that bad. Conclusion: there was only ever going to be one reason to watch this film and that was to see the Fat Slags, but, as they are not in the movie, there really is no reason to watch this film.	1
Terrible!	Turkey	These kind of films consist of falsified news. They are the films of the state. So they just try to prevent the people from seeing the right things. Also the movie quality is really terrible. The players are really amateur. And nobody has watched it since it was showed in some places. Because everybody says that these movies are falsifying the people. As a result I don&#x27;t recommend watching this film. It doesn&#x27;t worth watching. We need more professional movies. Even if you&#x27;re a talented filmmaker and you&#x27;ve made a movie that everyone is pretty much in love with, you&#x27;re still not guaranteed an easy ride. Because it is not easy to make grate movies in these days.	1
zero	ankara	THE trolls of akp come here and write good rewievs for this bad movie. troll means they gain money to make the akp propaganda on internet. at every where they are make comments and paid for this. believe me the movie is worst movie on earthEven 1 star is a lot for this movie. the producer says that it will break a record. he is right they break the record of the worst movie of world. this movie made by the order of the sultan tayyip erdoan. they try to make the people believe in their lies by this kind of movie and with some shows on TV. but modern people of my country don&#x27;t believe their silly lies. even this movie is free no one watch it. i wish we will break their lies and our country will go to the shinny days. the worst thing a country can live is manage by the peoples which says only lies to their public.you need to give a title to this movie. this title will be the most bad movie of all time.	1
The worst movie one can ever watch.	Istanbul, Turkey	That movie is a perfect reason reason why politicians should stay away from art. I don&#x27;t know if you know what is the story behind this movie, let me explain briefly.In December 2014, it was proved by numerous evidence that Erdogan (the president of Turkey), his family (Bilal The Clever (!) and Sumeyye The Evil) and some important governors from AKP (The ruler party of Turkey) were involved in some serious corruptions. Consequently the positive perceptions of public about Erdogan, his family and Akp were teared down. Since then, pro-Erdogan and pro-Akp media companies started a propaganda to cover these corruptions by creating an imaginary enemy: &#x22;the parallels&#x22;. Kod adi K.O.Z is work of those pro-Erdogan and pro- Akp media companies. With this movie, they aim to manipulate the facts and change the public opinion about those corruptions. They want people to believe that everything was a trap performed by &#x22;the parallels&#x22;.About the movie; regardless of the ideology behind it, casting, plot, music, etc. are at their worst. This is the worst movie that I have ever watched. If you want to make a propaganda to change the realities, you should do something way better than this.	1
Shameless propaganda movie	Ankara	After banning media to share clear corruption evidences, sending many journalist to jail and forcibly closing the cases without trial, Turkish government tries to convince voters using motion picture. Even though the scenario is absurd fantasy, production quality is above average. Seems like producers didn&#x27;t make any budget cut, that deserves one star for the sake of Turkish cinema.Considering that the movie aims people who is not into any form of art, it&#x27;s understandable that some theaters show it free. Due to it&#x27;s low box-office results, it probably will be shown in most of national TV channels just before the national general elections in June 2015. In summary, it&#x27;s a waste of time as a movie, but as a documentary it shows how politics can be shameless in order to keep their authority above public.	1
Extremely high propaganda with no sense of reality	Germany	It&#x27;s the most awful movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. From the beginning till the end just the propaganda of the dictator Erdogan in Turkey. There is no sense in the most of the scenes and the expectations of the viewers are not filled at all. Thus, the movie had a free entrance for a week. It&#x27;s a shame for the country, which mentions to be a democratic one. Very stupid end, very stupid story. Too much problems with the actors. The actors have no sense of authenticity and don&#x27;t play professionally. The story seems to be written by Erdogan himself. It&#x27;s a big problem, that this movie is a &#x22;must seen&#x22; in Turkish schools to manipulate the children. Avoid it.	1
It is not a movie, its AKP AGITATION.	United States	Well lets see here. I can&#x27;t exactly remember how or why I ended up seeing this movie It is so crappy acting, stupid story, no plot, dumb half wits, If I had the choice I would live with herpes in exchange for this movie being totally wiped from my memory. Words cannot describe how completely idiotic and boring KOD Adi K.O.Z is. And oh if you thought the previews had anything to do with the movie think again. They do not. A lot of people in the movie theater walked out never to return. Right now some of city mayors give free ticket to make AKP propaganda but apparently it is not working at all. here I am thinking Well, There is hardly a plot, but old, clich&#xE9; gimmicks to create a Enemy of the State. Does it work? Three? No. It does not. I have no idea how Cem Kurtolu, Hazm K&#xF6;rm&#xFC;k&#xE7;&#xFC;, Tolga Karel, Turgay Tan&#xFC;lk&#xFC;,Remzi Evren got persuaded to participate in the film (MONEY). What can I say? Awful film. That had to be the single worst movie in the history of cinematography. It is not a movie, it&#x27;s AGITATION FOR ELECTION.	1
Nazist Propaganda	Japan	This is a propaganda movie that supported by the president of Turkey and they tried to give their message with a terrible quality.Really awful. Don&#x27;t waste your time. if even they give you money to watch it you will regret and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer. There is no subject on that movie I was lucky I didn&#x27;t pay because it was free I mean cinema was free. Can you imagine they put this movie free so. Ratings will be high. But I said even 10000 lira you will never take your hours back. I prefer to go and watch horse race or ice skating rather then this fully rubbish movie.i could sit and do nothing and still I will be more happy that hours than spend hours watching this thing. I mean who wrote this? Do they have a mind? Really? And how could you accept a role as a actor in such a ridiculous movie? Are you OK? Please tell me? Why did you do that to us? Why ?	1
A bag of stinky lies	Japan	You can fool 45 percent of the population but not me. It is a movie version of the propaganda that we have been seeing for more than 1 year now on television, radio, newspaper, website and even in front of mosques after the Friday Prayer by distribution of fliers. How low will they get is the question and I think that they will try best to be the worst. You can fool 45 percent of the population but not me.

Ridiculous propaganda	Istanbul, Turkey	This is an insult to the art of cinema. Characters are forced with incompetent interpretations. The scenario is written by a point of view that is representative of senseless state repression. To watch this &#x22;non-aesthetic&#x22; film until the end, you have to be mentally retarded or you need to be one of them. The film is a praise to oppression, which nowadays has shown its ugly face in what it claims to be the movie format.. Do not waste your time on this ridiculous propaganda film: The only gain is a total awkwardness. Even Joseph Goebbels had done &#x96;at least- better ones in the Nazi Germany. This will be remembered as a significant disgrace in the cinema culture if remembered at all. This film should be protested on the international platform. What a shame!	1
A Dirty Scenario for Hiding Govts Corruption and Bribes	Turkey	Using Goebbel&#x27;s propaganda tactics, Turkish gov&#x27;t has successfully fooled the crowds in Turkey that it has no connection with corruption. And this &#x27;so-called&#x27; movie is their latest trick.Gentlemen, try to convince us with concrete proofs that 1. your ministers did not receive any bribe (in the form of an expensive wrist watch, for example). 2. the police, which you accused of international ensionage in this dirty movie, did not find thousands os dollars and money counters in the houses of your ministers&#x27; sons.Please don&#x27;t shoot a stupid, unrealistic propaganda movie in an attempt to show your &#x27;innocence&#x27;!	1
The worst movie Ive ever seen	UK	The worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen.. Don&#x27;t waste your time. It is quite obvious that Turkish ruling government commissioned that movie. Shame on you the producers.. You are just the marketing channel of lying government. On the other hand, the cinematography of the movie is awful too. Bad acting, worse directing. Total waste of time. Instead of watching that crap, close your eyes or stare at an empty wall will do more benefit for the soul and mind.I am just wondering, if the actors knew that they were a part of a crap project. Ah, they should be aware right? They must have earned a lot of money to be a part of that propaganda.	1
A communist era type of propaganda	United States	Imagine a totalitarian country leader pays to a media company to have a movie about himself, describing him as an angel/messiah sent to world to bless the human race! I bet you could have read this kind of stories in books describing a Soviet Union or North Korea type of countries. But to your surprise, it comes from a modern country in the middle of Europe: Turkey!The ruling party - AKP and its leader are trying to cover up the corruption they were accused of by any means: Dictatorship kind of laws, imprisonment of journalists, degrading anyone does not support them, and changing the judicial system to protect themselves from any lawsuits. Yes, this is what is happening in Turkey. And yet, financing a movie trying to make the &#x22;leader&#x22;-today&#x27;s president as a savior. Although technically you may call it a movie, but in fact it is a long version of an election advertisement of a corrupt political party.Still, do you want to watch it! You do not have to pay for tickets since this movie is FREE. Just go to the box office and get your tickets for FREE! I would go if they would give free popcorn and soda.	1
Waste of time	United States	This movie is as lots of people mentioned a propaganda movie. I&#x27;ve only watched the trailer but it was clear that it distorts the facts greatly. No one in their right mind would watch this non-sense.. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie.Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie.Crappy propaganda.

Negative polar of cinema art	Turkey	As seen &#x22;Bottom 100&#x22;, this movie is the worst propaganda movie of all time. Writing a review for this &#x27;thing&#x27; is a holy mission for future and developing of cinema. Watching this movie is already free. Producers almost offer money to people to be watched. Unfortunately, number of these type propaganda films in Turkey tends to rise. Only a word is enough to explain story: &#x22;parallel&#x22;. This word has a different mean in Turkey. This movie claims that &#x22;parallel state&#x22; always has &#x22;bad role for Turkey&#x22; for significant events in recent years in Turkey even in middle east. Slogan of Turkish government and this movie is one thing: blame parallel state.	1
Propaganda techniques of the movie	Izmir	Propaganda techniques that movie uses: 1. The first, form of propaganda that film uses is assertion. Despite being the most basic technique of propaganda, assertion is surprisingly effective. It consists of simply stating a debatable idea as a fact, with no qualification or explanation. Government is good, opposition is bad.2. Card stacking is a technique in which the propagandist gives an unfair advantage to one point of view, while weakening another. In the movie there is no opposing view, at all.3. Glittering generalities is a colorful term for the appealing, but vague words that often appear in propaganda. Rather than explaining the use of these words, the propagandist leaves them to stand alone as a defense of his or her position. Without context or specific definitions, they serve the sole purpose of evoking certain feelings in the audience. If everything proceeds according to plans, these feelings then translate into unquestioning approval of whatever the propagandist says. Motherland, motherland, and motherland! We wore our martyr clothes when we choose this path!4. An extremely common tool of the propagandist is the false dilemma. This fallacy is known by many names, including &#x22;black-and-white thinking,&#x22; &#x22;false dichotomy,&#x22; and &#x22;false choice.&#x22; Most commonly, it consists of reducing a complex argument to a small number of alternatives and concluding that only one option is appropriate. One product always works, and the other never works. In the movie: One group intends to save the country, and the other is out to ruin it. In reality, however, there are usually many possibilities that go unmentioned.5. Propagandists of the movie often oversimplify complex problems by pointing out a single cause or a single enemy who can be blamed. For everything from Gezi protests to suicides, pinpointing the enemy can help the propagandist achieve his or her agenda.6. People tend to distrust outsiders, and the plain folk technique takes advantage of these misgivings by helping the propagandist to appear more like the average citizen. In the movie, prime minister is extremely humble, easygoing and interacting with regular folks.	1
This Nazi type propaganda film is so bad theaters are actually showing it for free because they are under pressure of the government.	Amsterdam	Propaganda is something all governments or political fractions do. But doing propaganda in such a low quality is actually an achievement. What bothers me is while the government has all the resources and technical possibilities the best they can do is that joke of a film. Even that shows how shitty they are.The film is about a so called parallel state in Turkey, which is blamed for everything that is going bad and all the opposition (no matter how innocent they are) is labeled as a part of that parallel state by the government.Even if you set aside the untrue story film has no cinematographic quality at all.	1
Pure party propaganda....	Turkey	If I could give half a star I would! You can see such a film only in North Korea. If I could give half a star I would! You can see such a film only in North Korea.

Not only waste of time	istanbul	If you want to suffer and lose your movie appetite, this is the movie! If you want to punish yourself, this movie is one of the best options!Many things to say, but shortly, waste of time. It&#x27;s not waste of money, because it is free ( for ratings&#x27; sake!)Can you imagine that? And what kind of actor could accept a role in such a rubbish movie? Why did you do that to us? How could you do that to yourself? why destroy your image? It is another way to commit a public suicide. I feel sorry about all the people who acted in the movie and who wasted their time. just don&#x27;t be ridiculous, go home and spent some time with your kids, play games, water the plants in the garden, relax and have a sugar free coffee,and make sure that you forgot about the movie!	1
Goebels did it better	Izmir	I don&#x27;t know if this shitty waste of time thing called movie but I&#x27;m sure even conservative people of Turkey didn&#x27;t like this pile of crap. Its obviously a propaganda for Turkish government. The film is nothing but a composition of lies and ignorance. Its the same fascist system in Turkey now like Hitlers time but i think Goebels made it better with The triumph of the will. Although it gave same bad messages like todays Turkish government it was way better in cinematic way. Don&#x27;t watch it you wont get your precious time back. Also the box office results were so bad that the cinemas offered it free. Even in a country like Turkey whose people like anything if its free didn&#x27;t want to see this mixture of pure nonsense and brain agony thing. Your eyes bleed and your brain melts and pours down from your ears if you try to watch this mess. It is so awful that you can barely hold your screams and keep yourself away from burning every copy of this so called movie. If you have any piece of self respect you wouldn&#x27;t go to this amazing loss of time.	1
Worst Movie Ever	None	It&#x27;s just full of lies and bullshits and it&#x27;s a terrible movie. Even a funny cat video is better than this film(!). It&#x27;s just a propaganda for the government. And it&#x27;s scary Turkey Government using techniques of Nazis. And this film has got a terrible scenario, terrible actors, terrible musics.If you think a movie is bad, watch this bullshit and think again. And i think art doesn&#x27;t contain fascism so this movie isn&#x27;t art. It&#x27;s just a fake advertisement. Turkey Government is fascist, killer and thief. We don&#x27;t wanna see propaganda of them. So don&#x27;t watch this bullshit. Do something more important or just try to counting stars. It will be better than watching this movie.	1

Movie on Political Corruption by the Masters of It	Turkey	The movie is indisputably awful. I saw it in a theater when the tickets were made free due to its tremendous box office success until then. In fact, it would lead to a terrible stampede of art-sensitive, god-fearing, highly honorable people of Turkey if they insisted on their price policy because you know, art is for millet&#x27;s (millet being the proudly ignorant portion of Turkish demographics) sake. Seriously, this thing is an insfult to the art. It sucks so hard that it creates a black hole in the history of cinema. And the worst thing is, it was produced by the very folks who came to power in Turkey hand in hand with those whom they blame now.It&#x27;s so incredibly miserable that the unwitting statistical majority of Turkey thinks that the current government is &#x22;somehow&#x22; betrayed by a pseudo-religious community which the government had actually cooperated with from the very beginning. This movie is what you get when their interests eventually conflict. And here is a fun fact: the prime minister once claimed (after 12 years of power, access to any intelligence and government facilities) that he had just learned about the evil plans of this so-called parallel state to overthrow their &#x22;legitimate&#x22; government. Like all any propaganda stuff, this movie is intended to provide credibility to a crazy-ass set of lies that can only make sense in the political discourse. Anyway, that (not whether) the PM did not know about the activity of that so-called parallel structure was seriously debated and then accepted in Turkey and no one suspects anything. It sounds totally legit in Turkey. When a guy who has hours of voice records proving his corruption and lives in a mansion with an estimated number of 1150 rooms blames another guy for using the state for his respective interest, it totally makes sense in Turkey. Just try to imagine the logical processes involved.	1
This movie is for brainwashed Erdogan supporters	United States	Different from other totalitarian regimes, Erdogan&#x27;s party regime is not successful even in propaganda. Turkish people experienced the freedom once, they will never be controlled by an authoritarian regime. This kind of stupid attempts just make Turks laugh. It might affect a limited brainwashed Erdogan supporters but any people who has ability to critically think, even some Erdogan supporters, know why this movie was produced and the story of movie does not make any sense for anybody.Regarding to movie, this is just an failed attempt to make propaganda of corrupt and totalitarian Erdogan regime. Movie was terrible in all aspects. You do not need to pay it. Government financed producers and you can watch free sessions all over the Turkey. Everybody should watch not for it is a good movie, just for understand how Erdogan corrupt regime use this kind of dirty methods for dealing with their ideological opponents.	1
How a dictator can control the social media?	Turkey	Our dictator Tayyip Erdogan is in desperate effort to control media and social media. Surely, he can control the main stream media. The TV&#x27;s are even self censoring themselves now. But the social media is out of control, which drives him crazy. He attempted to totally ban Twitter and Facebook previously. Kod Adi k.o.z. is his propaganda movie, I guess, which was actually designed for people extremely ignorant, or extremely fanatic, or mentally challenged people. So, even for his voters this movie is a disaster. It ended up being the worst movie in IMDb ever, with an average 1.0 (it&#x27;s just because there is no 0.0). His trolls (who drive the voters in social media) were panicked; started to vote 10 star for this movie (as if they were never encountered cinema before). They try to write reviews here; but I realize there is nobody in Erdogan&#x27;s team, who can speak English. Erdogan has been working with Gulen so far (which is what the movie is about). Last year they broke up :) I assume all the educated people in the group were working for Gulen. After they broke up, Erdogan&#x27;s highest qualified agent is no more than a bully.All in all, this whole movie is a step back in civilization and collective mind.	1
worst movie i have ever seen do not watch it	Turkey	This movie is horrendous on so many levels - patronizing to Turkish people, incredibly bad plot and direction, the acting and dialogue is as comfortable as a dentist&#x27;s visit. I suspect the whole thing is purely a desperate attempt by president to pander to uneducated poor supporter&#x27;s (we call them sheep)reactionary tendencies.Either that, or it is just a giant ego trip for him. I had no preconceptions before I went to watch this, and left confused as to the amount of utter garbage wedged into what seemed like an eternity of boredom. Even worse, he is asking his moron supporters to bear false witness by skewing the votes here and on rotten tomatoes. Hypocritical? I&#x27;ll let you decide.	1
Couldnt be worse	istanbul	to clarify the corruption scandal that occurred in 2013 Turkish government decided to produce a propaganda movie. I respect their right to direct a propaganda movie but I can&#x27;t respect this awful quality. When I heard the budget (founded by government) of the movie I thought at least there were some good action scenes but it&#x27;s all about boggy acting and cheap PC effects. Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler used Joseph Goebbels as his propagandist and I have to admit (as technically) even Goebbels did much better movies than this producer.This movie is a shame for the cinema history and it truly deserves to be &#x27;the worst off all time&#x27; PS: The only good thing about this movie was I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it. Our mayor gave us a free-view opportunity.	1
The Worst ever...	turkey	No need to talk about this movie. Indeed, its better not to call it a movie. All you see in the movie is what you see in the trailer. That&#x27;s all. If you regularly watch the news, you can easily predict the conversations before they take place. No new thing. Just a garbage. It would be better to buy a ticket to a cartoon. Another thing is that this movie was filmed by tax payers&#x27; money. The story is all bad and based on the Turkish gov&#x27;s smear campaign on an opposite group to their ideas and policies. The current Turkish gov which is run by a political party called akp sees all opposite thoughts as a coup to their power. They accept no criticism. And this movie is a result of this sick policy.	1
Visuals and Meanings	Turkey	Political propaganda movies has never been such awful. It was a waste of time and money both. An AKP production! Sucks... Lies...By all Visual effects, pictures and script, it is made to give one message it is hatred. Besides all, acting is not sincere. Plots are phony and funny. Settings are terribly contradicting... What is this? Does Producers make this move for idiot viewers? It is not a comedy either. As it is said, &#x22;Honey drips from Honey Pod and Poison drips from Poison Pod. The movie gives very poisonous thoughts and feelings and hatred. It gave me no positive spirit and motion. All movie is about blinding eyes for politicians&#x27; rampant corruption and a political hatred for whom tells the truth. I wish Turkish Cinema could make movies to inspire people for some good deeds and make it universally accepted, understood Like LOVE, UNITY, SINCERITY, TRUTHFULNESS, LOYALTY and FRIENDSHIP. Please do not be a part of this corrupt POLITICS IN TURKEY. there is no use of it.	1
Horribly Bad, an insult to Human intelligence	Turkey	This trash is nothing but a series of advertisements, I don&#x27;t even recommend it only for people with low IQ. Everything about this &#x22;movie&#x22; is horrible. The acting is miserable, there is no plot at all, and it is highly biased on the views of one of the two political rivals by praising one while applying the &#x22;black propaganda&#x22; technique on the other side.

Dont waste your time to watch at this film.	Ankara	Don&#x27;t waste your time to watch at this film. One of the worst movies of all times. Based on politics life in Turkey. Made to be popular and it achieved so, being the worst... Not Only in Turkey but also in Germany the film has chosen the worst by its watchers. Characters in movie are also in shock as they were popular(!) actors and actresses. Rather I recommend you to watch at Selam-Bahara Yolculuk which deserves top rating. Bahara Yolculuk will be in theaters on 13.03.2015. The movie deserves to be the best. Because the movie is based on a true story. And tells the dreams of good intended people who are spread all over the world.	1
Bad, just plain bad, not even close to be a normal movie.	Turkey	Basically, a big propaganda. It was free in the theaters because It is made by peoples taxes. Just think about that for a minute... I mean Hitler made propaganda movies. And they were even better than these movies but do you see it, I&#x27;m criticizing this movie to a dictator&#x27;s movie and why? Because it is made by a freaking dictator! The Tall Man you call him. It&#x27;s horrible, nearly a movie. Acting: Fricking horrible Plot: Fricking bad and they say they are making a movie about &#x22;actual truth behind the lines&#x22;... Ugh Cinematography: What is it? Just please don&#x27;t watch this propaganda.Please just don&#x27;t for the love of god... I mean what the actual freak?! What were they thinking? They toughed we will believe this &#x22;thing&#x22;? We are intelligent enough to understand this is not even close to make us think this is an actual movie... And they say these are all true events but they killed actual living people in it?? They are living in front of our eyes?! What the hell?	1
Political Movie	Ukraine	this movie has been shot over an order. full of lies and fiction. and to smear a group that of world-known successful educationally and financially. also aiming to slander a religious leader who world knows and not to be grabbed by government of Turkey and ruling party. now in Turkey, ruling party wants to be more efficient on every field of life and does not want any opposition. this group (called Cemaat or Hizmet or so called parallel state) has not been surrender to them and kept saying their mistakes and did not bound them. so they try to smear and crash them and after this movement, they will crash other non governmental organizations. there are already some movements against their dreams of sole power and rule the country without any opposition but still half of Turkish are sleeping.This film made by a producer already confessed that he took it by order of government.	1
So it was true; THEY ARE ALL BIDON KAFALI	None	This &#x22;movie&#x22; is a disgrace to all actors and movie makers on this planet. My 7 year old nephew would come up with a better plot, and my other 5 year old nephew would do better acting than these bozos.They wanted to do propaganda and they had tons of options; a news story, a documentary, a biography... But they decided to make a &#x22;movie&#x22;.Do I decide to make a movie when I am mad at something? NOWhy?Because like any person with some common sense and some logic(and some brain cells), I am aware I am not good at producing movies, this is not what I do, not even as a hobby.But do they have any common sense or logic(or any brain cell)? Of course; NOT.So they decided to make a movie, even tho they had no idea how to make one.So this &#x22;movie&#x22; proves the legend; THEY ARE ALL &#x22;BIDON KAFALI&#x22;...	1
Goebbels did it better	Turkey	Governments always use the instrument of propaganda to fortify they position and claim to be the only solution for its people. The Turkish governments attempted to make a film with the same reason and tried to redirect their mistakes to some secret &#x22;behind the curtain&#x22; powers. This film should be regarded as the worst attempt to make propaganda. Goebbels was more successful almost 70 years ago. (In propaganda, not ideology!) The intellectual level of the makers is beyond detectable level. The scenario awful and the way to tie diverse facts even worse than any propagandist film I was ever exposed to. This is real art, art of intellectual torture.	1
Crappy political propaganda at most!	Turkey	I&#x27;m not even going to write about the characters, plot, issues, etc. It&#x27;s nothing more than a cheap political propaganda film molded into a nonsense crime/spy/suspense plot. It&#x27;s utterly worthless, shameful trash endorsed by the AKP (today&#x27;s ruling political party in Turkey) in anticipation of the upcoming elections. Reminds me of Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels&#x27; elaborate system of NAZI propaganda. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the full-starred ratings as those reviews belong to full time &#x27;paid trolls&#x27; working for their master!Deserves ZERO stars!!	1
very nice movie	None	it tells truth about Turkey. most events in movie are true. also cast is very successful. don&#x27;t mind about movie&#x27;s rating. it&#x27;s low because of Gulen&#x27;s crew. they&#x27;re trying to hide their aims and truth. if you&#x27;re really interested in Turkey&#x27;s real problem, you should watch it immediately. movie shows the real terrorists and traitors. people, who seems Muslims but they&#x27;re not, planning to help our enemies. they want money for theirs aims but they tells that, they&#x27;re spending money for Muslims, according to them, their leader is the prophet and he has no wrong. they change Islam for their profit. in this movie, you will learn their real aims and all of wrongs. director must be very brave because, when this terrorists are powerful, they&#x27;ve arrested some people because of their books and writings.	10
Good movie, but effects could be better	Netherlands	The people which are afraid to see the reality are only giving a negative review/score for this movie. I&#x27;m sure they never watched this movie either. Anyway this is my point of view: The effects were not so good to be honest, but the main purpose is to give a message to the Turkish people what kind of danger the deep state poses on the Turkish republic. The main character that played the prime minister were one of the best actors i&#x27;ve ever seen before. In short : People should only look to the messages. A little bit of propaganda is always present in this kind of movies, but that doesn&#x27;t means it deserves a bad review. The Gulen movement&#x27;s goal is to fill their own pockets everybody knows this. This is well explained by the movie makers.	10
Haters gonna hate mate	Turkey	The only movie could explain what&#x27;s really going on in Turkey last 4 to 7 years. They have showed every single detail which was made this sneaky religious order. Those haters just believe anything they see from media. They even don&#x27;t want their country to rise up. Because they can not put up with that real public is in order not those stupid money people. Open your eyes, we are 16th most developed economy in the world and counting up. What is matter with you? NOBODY WANTS TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU LIVE, GOVERNMENT IS JUST GIVING OTHERS THE RIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE OTHER FOR YEARS. Believe or not, Turkey is on the right way. No one can stop us from our way.	10
Code: Doubling social media	Turkey	The thriller movie tells the story of a religious sect. Leader of the sect advises his followers to double the social media yet he dreamed prophet and prophet advised him to do so! In real life! Really! He claims that! This heresy explains a lot about why so many troll has given 1 point to this movie even though they did not see it! Regarding movie, it is not a state of art. But a breathtaking engrossing storytelling with a lot of mafian style swagger lines which is a very popular cinematic method in Turkey. If you take a glance at rating analysis you will see clearly too many 1 point raters without seeing movie and 10 point raters that i doubt all of them see the movie! What to conclude neither an one point movie nor 10 point movie. Do not trust this polarized trolls at all :)	7
A must watch for everyone who wants to see the truths.	Turkey	This movie is based on a fictional story but actually it reflects the Turkey&#x27;s recent past in a very exciting storyline.To make the film clear in the readers&#x27;s mind i firstly would like to say that as you may see Turkey is becoming a powerful country in every aspect because of its very fast growing economy, increasing life standards, excellent foreign politics, Mr. President&#x27;s laudable strategies. However; especially in the last 2 years many incidents occurred which were obviously targeting the government of Turkey and when you watch this film you will witness all the conspiracies and the enemies of Turkish nation.------------Spoiler------------The story line is such a good one that you will get excited every second of the movie. If you are following the politics you will obviously enjoy the movie even more because the fictional persons (especially Mehdi Efendi and its followers) are reflecting some real identities and the incidents are actually real. And the attempt to arrest the undersecretary of T.I.T was such a good one. -------------Spoiler---------------The movie&#x27;s score was 1/10 while i was writing this review but believe or not the scores are just another conspiracy:) Park protesters (or chapullers;) which you can see in the movie as well are just organized themselves in HERE as well in order to give 1/10 for the movie. Because they just cant stand to see something supporting the government. But the truth is, all of these conspiracies were made in real and they are still working as a threat to the Turkish Nation. But they will never succeed, for sure.So do not look at the score and watch this movie. P.S.: We are waiting for the next movie as there are more conspiracies made and we would like to see them all in theatres as well. (17 December incident, especially)	10
Reality Show	pennsylvania	This movie is recorded by an order of Government of Turkey, The story is true but the way of showing is not impressive, it seems like one day job, script is glorified, it is about parallelism, which means hidden government in the government controlled by so called HOCA EFEND - Fetullah G&#xFC;len. Which in fact is crime boss, this movie hurts the followers of HOCA EFEND and his Allies (Gezi Park Players and who ever is enemy of government).Story is good, rent it and watch it, you will be surprised not disappointed. don&#x27;t judge the movie by reviews they don&#x27;t reflect the reality.	5
CIAmaat Reviews and votes	United States	I watched the movie. In movie most of subjects are true and I lived it in my life. I think most of the votes and reviews owners&#x27; didn&#x27;t watch the movie. They only wanted to denigrate the movie. It can&#x27;t be the worst movie in the world :). It&#x27;s very easy to vote something online. For example CIAmaat members know it. For example if something is good for their benefit, they all votes it quickly. We see it when the after- school supports closing. They all entered tweets at certain time. So we don&#x27;t pay no attention their votes and reviews. There was no slanders in movie. There was no lies in the movie. Maybe filming techniques are not best but this movie tries to tell about the Turkiye&#x27;s truths.	10
