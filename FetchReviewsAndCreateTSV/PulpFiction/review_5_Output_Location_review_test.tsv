I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of multiple narratives in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of Rashomon, which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the banality of evil, but the hard-boiled dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in Reservoir Dogs (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?	6
Quentin Tarantino takes you on one wild ride in this movie with the out there dialogue, the violence, the music, the drugs, the dancing and the 50s themed diner! The overall message of this spectacle in my opinion is that eventually you have to come down,whether it is from the high of blowing people away, from snorting heroin and over dosing and getting a shot of adrenaline in your heart to going back into a dangerous situation to do the right thing even when you want to run away. This movie is fast paced, laugh at loud funny at times and sometimes blush worthy but most importantly it is unforgettable. This is a modern classic that should not be missed.	8
I first saw Pulp Fiction around 2009. I must have been 14. Little did I know this movie would grab me in a way no other has. Im normally not the type to re-watch a movie less then a year apart, but within a month I had already seen Pulp Fiction twice and by the end of the year I had probably seen it about 7 times. Over the years Ive seen it at least an additional 15 times now, often showing to friends who havent seen it and It still never gets tiring to watch. Tarantinos brilliance is still unparalleled today. The dialogue is the likes of which no movie has come to match since. Pulp Fiction is a timeless movie that never gets boring no matter how many times you see it.	10
Known as a gangsters bizarre thriller, pulp fiction was directed by Quentin Tarantino and released in the year 1994. Starring Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, and John Travolta (Vincent Vega) and Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winnfield) as two criminals, this film won two Oscars and cost 8 million dollars. Jules and Vincent work for their mafia boss Marcellus Wallace. He is dealing with Butch Collidge, a boxer who failed to lose a fight on purpose after taking Wallaces money and is now planning to leave the city, but he cant because he lost his fathers watch. Vincent faces some problems when Wallace asks him to take his wife Mia out for a good time while hes away. The movie is presented in a series of chapters where the lives of unrelated people are put together in funny and black comedy events. The ending is very much unexpected. Pulp fiction was a 90s classics and the best gangsters thriller Ive ever seen. The performance of the actors is amazing, the script is brilliant and the music is excellent. This film appeals to an audience of over fifteen who love thrillers.	10
This is perfect storytelling, acting... An instant classic : an homage to B movies of the golden age and very modern in his conception at the same time. Samuel Jackson plays Tarantinos screenplay like a music instrument, John Travolta seems to be back from the dead, Harvey Keitel is hilarious, Uma Thurmans part is so moving, Bruce Willis is so badass, Maria de Medeiros so cute... Every songs of the soundtrack are unforgettable. Each frame absolutely gorgeous... Tarantino is a genius and his love for cinema explodes everywhere in this movie. With Wild at Heart by David Lynch, its one of the greatest rocknroll Palme dOr in movie history. If you havent see it yet,how lucky you are !	10
Great Movie I recommend it to everyone who hasnt seen this film. Its filled with action, suspense and terrific drama. Great for fans who love 1970s film. Sam Jackson, John Travolta and the cast did a great job is selling their characters. Tarantino, the director had the worst performance of the cast. He should stick to directing. The end of the film was special. I dont want to give it away but to end with the start of the film was creative and I bet this concept will be copied by upcoming directors for years to come. This movie will live forever and will be considered a classic. classic story telling, great dialogue and unexpected drama and action. Go see it! But be warned, you will be spoiled. You will expect all movies to be this good.	10
Pulp Fiction is just one of those movies that you always hear about but maybe have never seen. This movie is so different and interesting, director Quentin Tarantino really made a breakthrough film with this one. the camera angles were a really big appeal to me when watching this movie. The over the shoulder shots, as well as camera shots that were point of view shots, were very interesting. The camera was often angled down low and tilted slightly in many scenes which added a cool twist to the average eye level filming we see. The diverse cast of so many well known actors worked so well together to create a film as interesting and different as this one.	10
Taranino is one of those people you have to understand and respect to like a movie like this one.Im pretty sure by now most of.. everyone, has seen this movie. And either you LOVE IT, or you dont like it at all. This is widely spoken not the kind of movie about which youll say Err, Its OK...I myself am i big Tarantino fan and absolutely love this movie! Its action, humor  entertainment. Good casting and superb acting! This movie creates an environment that youll without a doubt want to see develop!If you havent seen it yet, and dont really know what to expect.. JUST WATCH IT ALREADY! :D	9
Quentin Tarantino has taken a spot as one of the best and most influential directors of all time. Two years after his success with his debut film Reservoir Dogs, he took his director skills up to next level in this 1994 black comedy Pulp Fiction. This film boasts a strong ensemble cast of actors including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keital, Uma Therman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Maria De Medeiros, and Eric Stoltz. Told in a nonlinear prospective, the plot follows the separate lives of their characters and how their lives untold in events that lead to their fate. The movie mixes elements of violence, humor, and satire, creating one of the most memorable and quotable movies of all time.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play two mobsters, who acquire a briefcase containing a secret item, and are assigned to protect it for their boss Marcellus Wallace (played by Ving Rhames) while facing troubles along the way. Travolta and Jackson put on some mesmerizing performances and showed incredible chemistry between each other. These two were probably the best characters of the whole film. Bruce Willis plays a professional boxer, who is caught up in a kidnapping plot while obtaining a watch from his father. Uma Therman plays the wife of Marcellus Wallace, who is invited on a date with John Travoltas character, only to face a serious dilemma involving heroin. This part includes one of the most shocking scenes where John Travolta makes an unprofessional attempt to save her condition. Then there is Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, who play a Bonnie and Clyde-like couple, who rob a local restaurant with unexpected circumstances. Director Quentin Tarantino also has memorable cameo in one scene with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.The most memorable aspects of this film is not only clever dialogue and Tarantinos unique style of cinematography, but also how amazingly well the characters are written. Quentin Tarantino did a great job at giving each character proper construction. This film is packed with a number of characters, but does well on making sure you remember each and every one of them. While the plot is a bit scattered-shot, the film manages to be entertaining in every way. Pulp Fiction is not only Quentin Tarantinos best film, but also one of the greatest films in the history of cinema.	10
The film that perpetuated Tarantino to an icon in the history of cinema is without question this one. Pulp fiction is written in such a way that even though it isnt filled with wall-to-wall action it glues the audiences eyes on the screen from beginning to end thanks to its snapping, self-referential dialogue, layered engaging characters and at the time revolutionary form of storytelling. The film focuses around several plot lines all of which somewhat connected in their own Shakespearian way, and of course the mysterious contents of the briefcase. Another strong feature in the film is the stellar performances from Jon Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman (all of which were nominated for academy awards as a result) who brought their A-game to the set, each delivering famous, ultra-quotable phrases throughout the film. Yes Pulp fiction is a timeless classic that will live on throughout film history.	10
Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hit men with a penchant for philosophical discussions and their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames); his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman); struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis); master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer). Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. This movie is a series of less-and-more related but separated short stories of crime and comedy that each result into an unexpected ending including unexpected deaths, sudden twists, black comedy events and horrific conclusions of crime and its following consequences. The theme of Pulp Fiction is power when Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the film. The theme of power is very prevalent during Jules Winnfields scene at the apartment and with one of the most controversial aspect of the film, which is the literal use of the N-word. When you watch the movie, you can tell that Marsellus has some severe power over all the actors in one way or another. Since I dont have a massive list of movies I watched, I cant really make a reference to another film due to the fact that of the films I watched, none of them match what pulp fiction has for its theme. The film uses the motif of the control Marsellus has over the characters, by using shadows to stay hidden and the fact that he is merciless, like when Vincent hears that Marsellus threw someone out the window for giving his wife a foot massage. When Marsellus is on the screen you can clearly see that the other characters are scared of him. The lighting of the film is very appropriate and it looks like there is a bunch of natural light when the scenes are near windows or outside and the use of the lights from the bulbs in the indoor scenes, where the light comes from those bulbs and not from an external source of light (studio lights to make the scene brighter). Fear and power are some of the easiest ways to gain respect from people, but it can lead to having some of your people to oppose you.	10
There is not doubt when it comes a list of films that everyone loves, this is one of them Thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.And whither Tarantino? Thats the real question. His career didnt actually begin with Pulp Fiction, what with the auspicious start he made a couple of years earlier with Reservoir Dogs (1992). And Pulp Fiction of course certainly wasnt his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol. I and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and ambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But lets be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more like Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasnt moved much beyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, hes still earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it too, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a measure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films in him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new directions, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways as a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus. Which isnt a terrible thing. Pulp Fiction is a remarkable movie. But, hey, we thought thered be more.	8
Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny are in a diner having breakfast discussing where should be the next place where they should rob, they decide that the best place to rob would be the diner that they are sitting in. They hold-up the restaurant. It then cuts to Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega who are on their way to collect a briefcase for their boss.

Still Shaken up from the supposes miracle that happened he decides that he is not going to kill them and after quoting his passage from the bible he leaves the diner with Vincent.This film starred: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Maria De Medeiros, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz  Christopher Walken.PULP FICTION was released in 1994. This was a really good film by Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino wrote and directed this film and it is a really fun watch. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson were class in this film and so was Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Walken and Eric Stoltz. My favourite performance in this film was Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield his acting in this film was great. I still havent seen Samuel L. Jackson come close to matching his performance in this film although he was good in DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. I also really like that this film is jumbled up with its chapters and I had fun with piecing the film together. The dialogue was brilliant and I highly recommend this film. Bruce Willis was really good as Butch and I actually found it really funny in the gimp scene although quite disgusting when Ving Rhames is getting raped. Christoper Walken did really good even though he had only a small role as the Vietnam veteran and Harvey Keitel was good as Winston Wolf. Credit to Tarantino for writing and directing this film as well as having a minor role in this film because he did good in that role also.****/***** Very good.	8
I dont think it is as good as many people think it is. Im definitely not saying its bad, in fact its far from bad, but I did think that the fact that the movies time was out of order was really unnecessary. A movie with no order in the time is supposed to make you ask a a lot of questions in the beginning. A great example of a movie like that is Tarantino s Reservoir Dogs. There were a lot of questions to be answered in the movie. The only question I asked myself in Pulp Fiction was Why are Jules and Vincent wearing beach clothes in the bar?. In fact, I wouldnt even ask myself this question because its really stupid. I thought the movie would have been just fine without the scrambled time.It has been considered that Tarantino is the king of dialog. I have to disagree. Admittedly the dialog is pretty entertaining in the first scene but overall, the dialog was pretty normal but in the scene where Vincent took Mia to a fancy restaurant, it was a boring scene to me because the dialog was just a rehash of what Vincent and Jules were talking about in the first scene. Afterwards, the unexpected dance everyone is talking about was pretty boring. I expected John Travolta to do sick moves but he just did moves anyone could mimic. What bothered me the most in this scene is the fact that Mia did coke in front of EVERYONE in the bathroom. Was it legal in the 90s? If not, its definitely a huge flaw. Overall, this scene could have been skipped.The movie is a dark comedy and there are some hilarious moments. There is one joke that was very unfunny to me. It might not be a very big deal to you but it is a big one to me. Its the moment when Captain Koons said that Butchs great grandfather stuck the watch up his ass. It is an overused and clichd joke. I expected him to hide it somewhere else more disgusting because the movie is a dark comedy. It might have been funny in 1994 but I dont care how funny it was back then, it wasnt appealing to me.Now for something positive. There is something I really liked in the movie and that is the style of filming. it was filmed in a way where the cameras wouldnt move most of the time. This style is a personal preference of mine but I am giving it extra points for that. And who can forget the brilliant performances? Although it is unfair to me that John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson got a lot more credit than Bruce Willis even though he had a much more exiting story but its not part of the movie so dont worry about it.	7
*** This review may contain spoilers *** one of my favorites,I dont know where to start but all i know is this movie is awesome and got its swagger. without spoiling it .Its a must watch for all. ive seen it twice now but this type of movies is definitely be watched for several times and itll stand the test time for decades to come. Tarantino did a great job from story telling directing and acting.One of my of if not my favorite directors of all time. I had great time watching it and i liked the story a lot. Samuel L. Jackson delivered one of cinemas greatest lines.Great chemistry between the actors through out the whole movie. pulp fiction is considered to be creative,stylish,refreshing and its came to be known as the Tarantino trademark.So after i seen it.i recommend it to everybody to watch it.And i had a blast watching it. and thank you for reading.	10
Tarantino delivers a masterpiece with Pulp Fiction. The master of quick- witted dialog doesnt fail to deliver, there is never a moment of boredom within the film. Watching through it just once, it is impossible to understand and grasp just how many references and criticisms there are to and about pop culture. The movie is highly stylized and distinctly carries its own identity, and Im not going to give away any plot points because this is a must watch, so Ill be as vague as possible. The movie seemingly has no linear plot structure since it jumps around a lot, and that is an understatement. With that being said, it just is impossible to lose attention from the viewer, but it is possible to get lost in the content, which is why it is more than deserving of multiple watch- throughs.	9
Pulp Fiction is a movie that begins and ends in the same place, a diner. This being said, the movie is not just a single layer film. Pulp fiction has layers upon layers that build upon it. Major characters and bit players all contribute to the convergence of story line in this film. To watch it once does not truly do it justice. To appreciate the film, the viewer needs to take in every moment. The movie follows the movements of 2 mob hit men (Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield) played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as they try to obtain and return a briefcase containing some unknown glowing beautiful item. This movie is better understood if it is pictured as a giant circle. When the movie starts is actually where its ending. This could be considered madness or genius on the part of the Director, Quentin Tarantino. As the hit men try to get the briefcase to their boss, Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames, they encounter a boxer who is trying to stiff Marsellus, named Butch played by Bruce Willis. A memorable scene in the movie involves Uma Thurman who plays Marsellus wife, Mia. Vincent saves her from overdosing on cocaine. As the movie unfolds, each nuance plays into the overall plot of this film. The theme of the film deals with the truth of human nature. Pulp Fiction doesnt delve deeply into each characters background, history or story; it merely gives you a small bite of the character. An example of this is when Mia asks Vincent about Amsterdam. He states that he just got back after being there for 3 years. Not why he was there or what he was doing there, just that he was simply there. This film focuses only how each character plays into the overall purpose of Jules and Vincent getting the briefcase to Marsellus and then weaves each character into the plot. When we meet Butch, we find out why his fathers watch is so important, but we never meet the father. Tarantino only wants us to know how the watch leads to his encounter with Marsellus. Each character is merely a representation of a type of person: The hit man, the mob boss, the boxer, the mob wife, etc. Tarantino likes a lot of dialogue in his films. Some cannot get past his excessive use of profanity and long conversations. He uses this in most of his films, such as Kill Bill which has been dubbed a revenge film, but there is a lot of dialogue throughout the film that leads the viewer on the journey to revenge. Two important elements in the movie are the importance of visual imagery and the use of music. From the iconic scene at Jack Rabbit Slims with the retro theme to the basement at Maynards shop with the gimp to the inside of Jules car after he accidentally shoots Marvin, visual imagery is key. Music is also very important, again at Jack Rabbit Slims during the Twist Contest when You Never Can Tell is playing and again later when Mia comes back home and is dancing to Girl, Youll Be a Woman Soon, each song creates the scene for the audience. The soundtrack for this film is still head and shoulders above the all others and to this viewer is the most memorable part of the film itself. When Pulp Fiction came out, people rushed to buy soundtracks to movies and this proves why. Each song has a purpose and its purpose, just like the entire movie itself, is pure genius.	10
Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the most influential films of modern times, inspiring writers and directors throughout the late 1990s and into the 2000s, and has also stamped its domination over pop culture for the last 20 years.Indeed, Pulp Fiction is writer/director Quentin Tarantinos magnum opus, and hes never quite reached the dizzy heights of this feature, which offers something to the audience that many films rarely do: a realistic script. While non-linear stories arent a new invention (thats not to say it isnt perfectly well crafted here, as it definitely is), Pulp Fiction opts to convey plot and character development to the audience through conversations between characters, in a screenplay where the viewer can imagine that these sorts of interactions could happen in real life. This is refreshing to see, as many films through exposition around like primates with their dung in a carbohydrate-abundant enclosure. In all honesty I cannot think of a script which delves into so many topics: foot massages, T.V pilots, fast food restaurants, life in The Netherlands, the conflict between faith and fact, 1950s celebrities, blueberry pancakes, what it feels like to kill someone, choppers, tea towels and gourmet coffee.Expert script aside, Pulp Fiction is fantastically directed and paced, as each segment in this non-linear story keeps you invested and interested, a notoriously difficult feat, where you could loose your audience at any moment due to confusion or, unfortunately, boredom. Well acted on all accounts, especially in Samuel L Jacksons Jules, but also with the other cast: Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and even John Travolta in the role which revived his career for a while, and lets not forget Harvey Kietels legendary appearance as Winston Wolf.All in all this is a superb film, unmatched in its screenplay and dialogue which will make you laugh, quake with dread, and most of all: think. Has been my favourite film since I first watched it, and so far nothing has topped the bill. 10/10	10
Above is actually my favourite line from the entire two and a half hour film! Anyway, Pulp Fiction is awesome! I have many favourite films, but, if there is one I can sit down and watch at any time, it is this! Tarantinos masterpiece is...well...a masterpiece! This is as flawless as it gets (no film is flawless). When Tarantino started making movies, I dont think anyone thought that a small-time indie filmmaker could create something so mesmorising and brilliant. This film is driven by the dialouge. I mean, a few guns go off and a couple people get stabbed and, of course, they are very important to the picture but the dialouge and the story is what really drives the film. The dialouge between Jules and Vincent is some of the greatest dialouge I have ever seen! From burgers in France to people getting thrown out of windows for giving foot massages, its just really, really, really, so, so , so, so, so,so well written. Vincent sitting down with Mia at Jack Rabbit Slims and the not-mindless- boring-getting-to-know-you-chitchat is nothing more than perfect. Then she over doses on potent heroine (which she snorts, thinking it to be cocaine) and what unfolds after that is true storytelling! I could go on forever about how great Pulp Fiction is, but I cant, so, I rate Quentin Tarantinos beautiful piece of moving art, a 10/10.	10
Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesnt care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie Pulp Fiction is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the years best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, hes in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. Its that very lack of caution and introspection that makes Pulp Fiction crackle like an ozone generator: Heres a director whos been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take screenwriting classes that teach them the formulas for hit films. Like Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named Thrilling Wonder Stories and Official Detective, the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.John Travolta stars as Vincent Vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. We see him first with his partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson); theyre on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward Yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in Paris they have a French word for Quarter Pounders. Theyre as innocent in their way as Huck and Jim, floating down the Mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other.Travoltas career is a series of assignments he cant quite handle. Not only does he kill people inadvertently (The car hit a bump!) but he doesnt know how to clean up after himself. Good thing he knows people like Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by Eric Stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations.Travolta and Uma Thurman have a sequence thats funny and bizarre. Shes the wife of the mob boss (Ving Rhames), who orders Travolta to take her out for the night. He turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy Buster Keaton would have been envious. They go to Jack Rabbit Slims, a 1950s theme restaurant where Ed Sullivan is the emcee, Buddy Holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. Thats before she overdoses and Stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at Travolta, YOU brought her here, YOU stick in the needle! When I bring an O.D. to YOUR house, ILL stick in the needle! Bruce Willis and Maria de Medeiros play another couple: Hes a boxer named Butch Coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesnt. Shes his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesnt understand why they have to get out of town right away. But first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. The history of this watch is described in a flashback, as Vietnam veteran Christopher Walken tells young Butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, Private Doughboy Orion Coolidge, and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. Walkens monologue builds to the movies biggest laugh.The method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, get in way over their heads. Most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control.	10
Quentin Tarantinos mesmeric Pulp Fiction is a slow dance on the killing ground, a prodigious horror-comedy spun out with such ferocious comic glee and buoyancy that belie its seeming cruelty. Superficially set in the gang haunts, streets, bistros, apartments, pawnshops and eateries in the cheesiest corners of modern Los Angeles, this dizzily convoluted noir plunges us into a kind of retro-nightmare fantasy land (formed of Tarantinos own pop-drenched experience) that keeps looping back on itself and traps us in a cul- de-sac of double-crosses, absurdity, arousal and danger, never completely sure of where anyones going or why  creating a sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. The structure itself is wickedly ingenious: Three interconnected stories, bracketed by several preludes and a few codas, are told deliberately out of sequence, with the same cast - a bloody band of outsiders - popping up everywhere. Most of the characters are familiar - the boxer who refuses to throw a fight (Bruce Willis), an obsessive war veteran (Christopher Walken), a mob bosss jaded wife (Uma Thurman), two desperate young lovers starting a crime spree (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer), a pair of single-minded hit men who operate within a twisted code of honor (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) - but Tarantinos approach to their behavior consistently avoids the stereotypical. By and large these mugs exist in a moral vacuum which, for Tarantino, is the ideal atmosphere for cracking jokes while cracking open heads. Their tales all start slowly, but soon everyones destiny plays out as the stories dovetail into outlandish twists. Stuff happens in Pulp Fiction, exhilarating, jaw-dropping, visceral stuff but Tarantino weaves the stock stories into an amazingly coherent whole. Unlike other action-thrillers, this movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialog, as the lingo takes on a murderous eloquence - a verbal swagger. The tension Tarantino creates between the threat of guns and the greater threat of verbal fusillade is electrifying. Its hard to imagine any viewer leaving this extravagantly demented low- life lollapalooza without carrying away at least a few indelible moments. The entire cast, like Tarantino, also seems to revel in sloshing around in this muck, each one of them having a time of their lives.Pulp Fiction also makes it clear, despite its gory content, that Tarantino isnt just some punk nihilist on a sick joyride; his movies are all about consequences. There is a moral core in Pulp Fiction too- a subversive one. But ultimately this is also what makes the movie so unexpectedly buoyant. Despite the drugs, the blood, the language and the grit, Pulp Fiction is fundamentally light-hearted. Its fluff!	9
I just started on IMDb and came across this great classic Tarantino Movie. Is there anything that anyone could add to what has already been said...classic, awesome, love it :-) I have not seen any really bad Tarantino movies...Often wondered if there could ever be any kind of follow up to this...John Travolta shows off his usual dancing skills with The Chuck Berry Classic You never can tell Probably made more famous from this movie. Its hard to believe how along ago it was...even if it is watched today it is timeless.....that must make a great movie..keep it classic. The fact that you can watch it timed time again is great...if you were flicking through the channels of the TV and this was half way through...you would watch it again until the end...That tells a story.	9
Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, hes in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. Its that very lack of caution and introspection that makes Pulp Fiction crackle like an ozone generator: Heres a director whos been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take screenwriting classes that teach them the formulas for hit films. Like Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named Thrilling Wonder Stories and Official Detective, the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.	10
Definitely a dream come true movie...different scenarios and full of comedy and action. I would recommend it to those who are seeking a thrill and want some action themselves...I especially love the dark/mysterious tone to the whole plot. A true is not really polite to gesture...but this film was spot on. To those who love thrillers...this is a piece by piece film.Very good movie but some scenes lacked emotion.I wonder if this film gets more money through donations. Die Hard was also a similar film tone. Loved the various change plots.	9
I remember that back in the mid-90s, when Tarantino-mania was in full swing, the motor-mouthed former video store clerk-turned-auteur was always surrounded by controversy. His two movies, Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction were portrayed as cruel, violent and sadistic by the media, while movie critics swooned over his pulpy, reference-heavy characters and innovative dialogue. Over 20 years later, Tarantinos films seem laughably mild compared to the casual ultra-violence of most 18-rated movies regularly released today. But while Reservoir Dogs can arguably be dismissed as a marvellously scripted and meticulously acted rip-off of City on Fire (1987), Pulp Fiction seems as fresh as the day it was released.The black-suited duo of Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and the misty-eyed gangsters moll Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) have been reduced to movie icons, adorning the walls of students and making it easy to forget just how well written they are. Tarantino is fascinated by the humdrum of these casual killers lives, and their conversations about cheeseburgers, foot- massages and what constitutes a miracle sparkle with invention, intelligence and laugh-out-loud humour. It makes these cartoon characters, who seem they have been ripped straight from the pages of a book found in a dime-store book shop, seem real. Even though they have just shot two unarmed men in cold blood, you would still want to buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brains.Pulp Fiction, as Im sure you already know, tells three intertwining stories out of chronological order. After successfully obtaining a briefcase belonging to their boss, hit-man Vincent Vega is given the responsibility of looking after the big mans wife, Mia, for the night. He takes her to a retro diner where they talk pop culture and dance to Chuck Berry, and the nights events then take an unexpected turn. Travolta makes for an astonishingly sweet killer and heroin addict, and this story in particular sizzles with sexy dialogue and real chemistry between Travolta and Thurman. The now-infamous scene of an improvised adrenaline shock still has the power to make you wince, while remaining funny and utterly absurd all at the same time.The second story, The Gold Watch, focuses on ageing boxer Butch (Bruce Willis), who after failing to follow thorough with his role in a thrown boxing match - organised by Vincents boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) - flees to the safety of a hotel room and into the arms of his lover Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros), who he intends on whisking overseas along with his wad of stolen loot. However, upon realising that Fabienne has failed to pack the gold watch handed down to him through many generations and eventually by his fathers friend Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), he must return home to reclaim it. The events that transpire are some of the most outlandish work Tarantino has ever done, filled with gunfire, mutilation, rape, and a gimp. Such relentless brutality may have been off-putting, but Tarantino keeps you reassured that its okay to laugh at what youre seeing, that its only a movie. Its a textbook lesson in black comedy.The narrative then jumps back in time to Vincent and Jules in the aftermath of the hit seen at the start of the movie. After an extremely gory accident, they are forced off the road and seek the hospitality of Jimmie (played by Tarantino himself). They hire professional fixer Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who races against the clock to clean up the mess before Jimmies wife arrives home from a night shift. The film climaxes at the diner shown in the opening scene, as Vincent and Juless quiet breakfast is interrupted by a husband and wife stick- up team (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer). The third segment is the funniest and features the most memorable dialogue, as Winston tries to motivate an objectionable Vincent (pretty please, with a cherry on top, clean the f*****g car,), and Jules educates his new foes following the life-altering miracle he believes he has just witnessed.Featuring highly on practically every best of list from 1994 to the present, Pulp Fiction needs no introduction and I doubt it ever will. Though I have enjoyed all of Tarantinos movies with the exception of 2007s tedious Death Proof (though it fares better when viewed in its Grindhouse entirety), I dont rate him as a truly great film-maker, as I dont feel he has ever managed to shake his compulsion to homage. But Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly a masterpiece, like nothing else made before or since (though many attempts have been made in vain). A thrilling exercise in style and substance, beneficial to cinema as a whole and responsible for re- igniting a few careers on the way. I cannot see Tarantino ever topping his achievements here, but then again his movies never fail to surprise me.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com	10
Reading through the reviews for this film, I was shocked to see so much negativity (relatively speaking)! I really dont understand why anyone would not enjoy it - I could easily say this was one of the best films I have watched in my entire life. Not only was the simplicity of the story a great base for it, everything about the film gave it an unbeatable quality, with the amount of detail put into every sketch of it, as can be expected with Tarantino. I believe what makes the film so appealing is the dialogue (ideas, words and general execution of it) which is present throughout, start to finish, from simple conversations, to the monologue given by Jules towards the end. It makes the two hours of film fly by fast, but remains with one for a long time afterwards. Really, everything about it contributes to the greatness of the film. Its both hilarious, intense, and bloody enough for my liking. I am a huge fan of Tarantino in general, and I believe this movie is very representative of him and deserves all the acclaim it has received.Honestly, I could watch and rewatch this film hundreds of times. Absolutely amazing.	10
All the actors in this film are the best. They are the best because they are all driven to be the best, in a casual, yet f off kind of way. From what I gather, they dont care about the reviews, they are just that far into their characters, which makes for the best kind of film. This movie brings new light to the term cool. I give this film a 10 simply because its real, in a dog eat dog gritty way, Pulp Fiction is a movie I can play on repeat, even with the mistaken over dose scene, and blood, every time I watch it, I fall in love all over again. Real life, if real life came to your front door with a gun. From personal experience I would go into this movie with an absolutely open mind, and freshly open brew.	5
A masterpiece through and through, i figure by now everyone knows and has reviewed this movie but what the heck its that good and that timeless/classic. Everything is on point from the story, to the story telling, to the actors, to the music chosen and all the little side conversations/side storys. Some scenes are shot in one long take and really make you feel like your there more than a mash of different shots. Riddled with memorable lines and almost an feeling of cool in the air as odd as that may sound. A bit graphic and harsh at times but is never pointlessly violent, just enough to feel real. It doesnt more fast beginning to ending but when it does move fast it goes as fast as humanly possible. I have enjoyed every Quinten Tarentino movie Ive ever watched but this takes the cake for me as the best and has yet to be duplicated	10
Pulp Fiction paradox no doubt comes from the individual director. Contrasting specifically demonstrated the love of violence and found at the dump film garbage gems their real ego humanist and idealist , Tarantino was one of his best films. Dramatic ideally divided into three separate stories, harmoniously living space of one film, Pulp Fiction exists under the laws road movie. From the beginning of the road dives to the same dives in the final - seems to be circling round and round on the spot, this movie still does a huge way. Therefore Fiction (as, in fact, all the other Tarantino films) remained in history whimsical set of quotes , and alive, just pour in cinematographic reality. And the Olive Branch with Oscar for the most modest scenario of the possible rewards.	10
A movie that is beautifully directed, with a great acting crew, fresh duologues, that is fun to watch and difficult to understand completely. It is different from many other movies in a lot of ways: from the nonlinear narrative to the unpredictable plot twists, it manages to keep you glued to the TV and is never boring. Quentin Tarantinos fans should definitely see this movie, since it may as well be his best one so far. And if you are not, than maybe this is the movie that will make you one And dont forget to read about all its different meaning s and hidden messages. :D I wont say nothing more, in order not to reveal same spoilers.	10
