The masterpiece without a message	10	Baltimore, MD	One of the early scenes in Pulp Fiction features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and its also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didnt know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, Pulp Fiction wouldnt be Pulp Fiction. I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.Its no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. Pulp Fiction, is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or art about art. It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives Ive ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, Be cool and no ones going to get hurt, which is just the type of line youd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines arent just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mias statement to Vincent, Thats when you know youve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.What is the movies purpose exactly? Im not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.Theres a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but were never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really about anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind. 
Simply The Best	10	England	To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will. 
One of the best movies of the century!	10	Warsaw, Poland	 If you think Pulp Fiction is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many f words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is cool, he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about Pulp Fiction? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece. 
Unbelievable.	10	Canada	Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it. 
The Movie that redefined a genre	10	Halifax, Canada	Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film. 
It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!	7	United States	 My oh my.  Pulp Fiction is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.  
Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece	8	Barcelona, Catalunya	 Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a tough guy image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger... is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.  
One of the Best Films Ive Seen In A LONG Time... and still is	10	United States	Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? Its filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that weve seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jacksons superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time youre surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... Ill leave to you. 
Awesome!	6	None	I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they werent sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didnt think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930s (even to my one fairly hip relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travoltas pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jacksons sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Williss deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you cant help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later films sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990s, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, dont miss another 1990s Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.) 
Tour de Force	9	Oregon, USA	Thats what this 1994 film is, a tour de force cinematic expression by Quentin Tarantino. A film with which Tarantino staked his claim to the title of genuine Hollywood wunderkind, auteur, young genius, all ala Orson Welles. Pretty heady stuff.By what means? First, with a snappy script with witty if not cerebral give-and-take dialog, written mainly by Tarantino himself. Then, by populating the cast with an intriguing hand-picked array of actors to deliver those well-written snappy lines. This film oozes inspired casting, of actors who either played against type or at least became offbeat and edgy in ways in which we hadnt hitherto known them. Then, through the editing process, by telling the story in a maximum non-linear way, out of time, reducing the film to a series of seeming disjointed non-sequential vignettes, each vignette featuring the aforementioned snappy dialog delivered by the aforementioned hand-picked edgy actors. It is only after watching the entirety of the movie, and reflecting back on it, does the gestalt emerge for the viewer. And, it may take more than one viewing to get there. Then, lastly, by topping it all off with a snazzy soundtrack. Thats how. Add all that stuff together and you get Pulp Fiction.The film received its share of acclaim, and deservedly so. But that said, while seen by most as a good film, Pulp Fiction is not regarded as another Citizen Kane, and Pulp Fiction is not ensconced in the pantheon of the greatest of the great Hollywood films of all time. Those are for a reason. As good a cinematic achievement as Pulp Fiction is, the fact is that as a film it plows turf thats just way too coarse for comfort. Over-the-top blood, guts, and brains-blown-out violence. Gritty gutter language. Subject matter dwelling in the underbelly of life that goes way beyond seedy or unseemly. And its all presented in a very graphic way. Some people really like it that way. Hey, I understand. Thats what Tarantino wanted too, right? But the simple fact is that such fare isnt for everyone. Period. In this way its own intentional and unrelenting coarse nature is what self-selects it out of the greatness category. To achieve greatest of the greats greatness it has to be seen that way across the board, amongst every audience. Pulp Fiction by Tarantinos design isnt intended to appeal to everyone.And whither Tarantino? Thats the real question. His career didnt actually begin with Pulp Fiction, what with the auspicious start he made a couple of years earlier with Reservoir Dogs (1992). And Pulp Fiction of course certainly wasnt his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol. I and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and ambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But lets be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more like Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasnt moved much beyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, hes still earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it too, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a measure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films in him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new directions, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways as a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus. Which isnt a terrible thing. Pulp Fiction is a remarkable movie. But, hey, we thought thered be more. 
The rebirth of a genre  and film history	10	wherever good films play	I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what weve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines  its a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if its just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then theres the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with Pulp Fiction. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of chapters  there is so much playful creativity at play here, its just a pure joy to watch.If youre a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats  and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even stealing from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantinos masterpiece today, its impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after Pulp Fiction. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, its got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - its such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. Its  well: its Pulp Fiction. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/ 
The Most Overrated Film in Existence...	7	Latvia	Pulp Fiction is the quintessential 90s crime film. Pulp Fiction changed the cinematic landscape when it was released, it broke new grounds in terms of screen writing and revived the career of John Travolta. And so on and so forth. In other words, Pulp Fiction is important film in the history in cinema, but its not the best film ever. I have seen Pulp Fiction several times and after each time seeing it, I tend to enjoy it less. I saw it first time a few years ago and loved every second of it. But after seeing few hundred more films and especially grindhouse/exploitation films, Pulp Fiction starts to loose its charm. Before I continue this thought, I should name the good stuff first. I loved every moment with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. They did a phenomenal job and elevated the already strong dialog. Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel were also great and so are the scene with Christopher Walken is still amazing. But aside from the strong acting and great dialog, there isnt a whole lot to Pulp Fiction. Its just bunch of stories that happened in non- linear fashion. Its all being hip and cool and saying clever dialog. There isnt any complex characters like in Jackie Brown and it lacks the creative visuals of Django Unchained or the tension of Inglorious Basterds. I wont deny that Pulp Fiction is very entertaining but there just isnt enough substance or craftsmanship involved to endure multiple viewings.Films like Apocalypse Now, Lady Vengeance, Taxi Driver, Clockwork Orange and many others, holds up much better after watching them multiple times. Those films can be enjoyed purely from the technical aspects and as well as the story and characters. Pulp Fiction is a popcorn film for those who enjoy dialog, cool characters and movie references. I like films with an emotional core, strong characters and impressive visuals. Pulp Fiction is a film that most of the people have seen. If you havent then go watch it because its entertaining, very accessible 90s crime film. To me Pulp Fiction feels dry and lacks the elements that draw me in films. 
Why Did People Like this?	5	New Haven, CT	 Why did people like this?Tiresome streams of pop-culture references?(like kane in Kung Fu Elvis or Beatles? Brady Bunch or Hogan's Heroes? Buffy St. Marie or Dusty Springfield? Leo Sayer or Captain & Taneall?)mundane out of context dialogue?(wow this coffee sure is good. I didn't expect you to have such good coffee.  this is one mean cup of joe!)Hip depictions of Drug Culture.?It's annoying bellyflop into the middle of the retro craze fashion herd?one dimensional characters pointing guns at each other's heads? (the cheapest, most half-assed, most cliched way to generate drama = person pointing gun at another person's head.  And yelling. over and over.)cool sunglasses?Take these things out, and the movie still isn't very good. Leave them in and it's trendy and annoying.If you are a teenager and don't know anything about HK films, films from the 70s, or the 70s in general, are easily duped by hype, I urge you to see this movie. It was made for you!! It will TOTALLY BLOW YOU AWAY, MAN! Dude! 
Too long, too boring with poor story development	3	None	It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesnt work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isnt.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He played a dance, which isnt the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesnt dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isnt a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys arent just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isnt like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didnt have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesnt last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isnt a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece dont know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they dont really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip. 
9 IMDb? Really?	1	Egypt	Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. Im even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didnt like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothings wrong. Its a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were OK movies but didnt deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. Im not going to tell those of you that havent seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Dont listen to anyones opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then youre COOL! 
Could Be Most Overrated Movie Of All Time	1	Bayside, San Andreas	Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isnt.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they dont.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isnt a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess. 
Flat and Brainless	2	United States	As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. Id discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadnt before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving Pulp Fiction just as much as I did back then, but I didnt. There was nothing there, no core. All the things Id loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that cant decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? Its violence thats harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.Its a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in its favor is that its somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but thats not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like Andrei Rublev is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. Pulp Fiction is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. Its very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. Its so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But its paper thin. This is exactly what I dont want in cinema 
Umm...?	4	United States	So there is a lot of hype surrounding Pulp Fiction. It won Original Screenplay. It was nominated for six other Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. I see it is given four out of four stars if it is on TV. It is also in IMDbs Top 250. (But) what is the big deal about it? I was bored and disappointed. Pulp Fiction did not really make a whole lot of sense. I can not remember if it was nominated for editing or not. If they wanted to be in that category or have a better chance at winning then obviously more editing should have happened. I do not see the point of Vince and Mias date. All if not a lot of that should have been cut. Why drag on Bruce Willis being on the run from the mafia don? That took too long. Was the whole story about the watch necessary? Couldnt Bruce and his woman just talk about it? Aside from being disappointing and boring Pulp Fiction was confusing. Bruce shoots John Travolta. And kills him. So how is he alive in The Bonnie Situation? Does Quentin Tarrantino not like editing too much? Well more editing could be needed a lot of times.(PF hint hint.) So yeah Pulp Fiction was boring, disappointing, confusing, etc. It should not have won Original Screenplay. It should have gone to someone else but if all five nominees were bad then it should have been none of them. Too much hype. Too much movie. Overrated. I can not remember much of this movie and happily so. So what is such the big deal? 
the most over valued film of the '90s	2	Rome, Italy	Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min! 
blood and f****** spirituality	8	Virginia	 I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole Jules redemption-speech by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.  
A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.	1	Toronto, Ontario, Canada	There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called style. There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve.Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesnt necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldnt wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines).The strangest thing is, while the characters are in character, as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. Theres really only a decent short film in all of this.The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesnt connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing.Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70s music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there.While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because hes alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesnt have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roths character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler.As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. 
Unadulterated dreck	1	Wisconsin USA	 This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB. 
Redemption? Spirituality? Yeah, Right.	3	Seattle, WA	 The comments for Pulp Fiction generally fall into one of three categories: 1) Awesome Dude! The best movie ever! raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.I had read about Reservoir Dogs (but not seen it) when Pulp was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. Apocalypse Now and Seven are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of Pulp. I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that Pulp Fiction has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.***SPOILERS*** One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.***END SPOILERS***Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new (Rashomon), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue (Scarface, for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk. 
The worst movie I've ever seen	1	United States	I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do. 
One-dimensional modernist pap (minor spoilers)	1	United States	 Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people?  Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content?  I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.Why is this movie so bad, you ask?  Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here.  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off. 
Enormously Overrated	5	Backwoods Canada	The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadnt finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, thats the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. Its a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who cant get the story straight and have to keep going back: Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . . I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I dont think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and thats why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they dont fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. Its like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when Shut the f*ck up, fat man! is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy. 
Hands down, the best film of the '90s.	5	south carolina	Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product.  
Good Yet Over-rated	6	United States	Quentin Tarantino is a good director who has a knack for combining wildly imaginative music selections for his movies that seem to work so well you have to laugh with joy.He also is known for dark comedy, combining unexpected twists that dismay audience members to the point they often refer to him as a genius.The problem with genius is that what is genius to some is mundane to others. Tarantino is also known for his plot twists. However the excessive focus on plot twists creates an expectation from the audience, which opposes the basic appeal: the element of surprise.In Pulp Fiction, twists are introduced with little finesse. Tarantino has improved with the years, but Pulp Fiction, an early film, becomes boring before it is over.Certainly worth watching, but early and raw compared to Tarantinos later films. 
Didnt like it at all! its just me, I guess...	3	Greece	I have watched 75% percent of this film twice: the first time, I watched it on TV, and about 3 quarters of the way, I gave up... However, due to the films cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didnt like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...Why is that?First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didnt like at all...Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantinos films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldnt be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasnt the actors that disappointed me, but the films script...So, the verdict:It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems Im one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction... 
One of My Favorite Movies Ever	10	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	The hit-men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that Gods hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption and the winner and weakest Forrest Gump) with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. Pump Fiction saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult Reservoir Dogs. The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Pulp Fiction  Tempo de Violncia (Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence) 
The worst Movie ive ever seen in my life.	1	United States	Absolutely no idea why this film is so popular. I was bored out of my mind from the first scene to the last waiting patiently for a twist of some sort to tie the multiple stories together, which never happened. Probably my least favorite movie ive ever watched. The acting wasnt bad and the film did tie in some aspects of popular culture and previous films, but if the viewer doesnt give a crap about any of the characters whatsoever, or the plot(if you could call it that), then whats the point. I gained nothing from watching this movie besides an intense feeling of emptiness that usually comes after wasting 150 or so minutes of your life watching a pathetic piece of crap film about nothing. Was I at the edge of my seat, yes, however It wasnt because of the suspense, I couldnt keep my head from falling forward or my eyes open. And the way that the scenes were arranged, terrible. The movie memento is hard to follow sometimes and slightly dull at some points but at least there was a freaking point in the way the scenes were arranged, considering the main character had memory problems. In this movie, there was no reason for the random mix up of the scenes, except to just do something different and make a movie so weird and disgusting the critics think its a masterpiece. I usually like movies that are critically acclaimed, like The Godfather, one of my favorite movies, but Pulp Fiction isnt even in the ball park. There isnt the dark complex characters like in the godfather, just a bunch of rambling idiots tripping over their stupidity. 
Terrible	1	United Kingdom	This movie is definitely the most overrated piece of sh*t ever.No story, no plot, no message, just Tarantino so totally in love with his own witty dialogue.The movie is empty in every sense of the word. In addition, its also horribly boring and therefore ridiculously hard to watch. I always try to sit through every movie I start, but damn, with this one it was a hard task not to simply get up and walk away.Pulp Fiction does not deserve to be on top of IMDbs list of best rated movies with actual masterpieces like The Shawshank Revenge. The latter is a work of art, Pulp Fiction is merely a piece of sh*t dressed up as one and its amazing how many people fall for it. 
Boring	1	United Kingdom	Boring. Rubbish Film as per most of Tarantinos stuff. The only good film Tarantino ever directed was the first half of Dusk till Dawn. True Romance was good as well,though he didnt direct it. It was also let down somewhat by Tarantinos poor dialogue (see Patricia Arquettes speech where she reveals shes a call girl. Appalling dialogue. Very Tarantino.) I recommend you spend you time better by watching all the films hes paid homage to (ripped off) such as Vanishing Point, Death rides a horse, the Baby Cart series, The original Inglorious Bastards etc Tarantino and his rehashing of films which have passed out of the collective conscious is pretty unpleasant and not clever. The whole point of taking influence from other peoples work is to then create something of your own which is greater than the sum of its part. This Tarantino fails to do repeatedly. 
no substance	6	None	The 90s sucked. It was one of the major eras of entitlement, and dagnummit, Quentin Tarantino was ENTITLED to the stylistic gimmicks he absorbed from French new wave, 70s exploitation and martial arts films. He was entitled to use every character as a mouthpiece for his preciously quirky, offbeat voice. He was entitled to that word that makes Spike Lee mad when white people use it. He was entitled to co-opt obnoxious heroin- chic, hip retro-fauxhemian fashion trends. Tarantinos movies echo the problem with Modernism: okay, you think the status quo is Bad, but if what you do is just a kneejerk reaction to that status quo with no values, ethos or any sort of moral core, how can you be sure the result wont also be Bad? In fact, chances are it will probably be Worse! Right? Nonsense. The emperor doesnt appear to have clothes, but thats just because only the most profound, virtuous people can see them. You want to be part of that group, right...? 
People Acting Stupid	7	Terra	 *********Spoiler Warning**********When this movie came out a lot of people I knew were making a big deal about it because it was made by a guy from Knoxville who even talked about K-town in the movie---and guess where I lived at the time?  Most people overlooked that Tarantino was only born there and lived most of his life somewhere else, and both Tarantino and Knoxville are highly overrated.  Trust me.I can't see why this movie is regarded as highly as it is; it seems the key to Tarantino's storytelling is to mix together story elements kind of like a blender.  So we get things like the cab driver who's a sexy latin woman who'd look more at home in a luxury restaurant than a grungy cab, or the very seventies looking Samuel L. Jackson running around with the nineties looking John Travolta.  The result is the average person goes that's kind of strange, while the intelligentsia go yes, the man is a GENIUS!I put off seeing this movie for several years because of the supposed extreme violence and the notorious rape scene.  When I finally broke down and watched it I was surprised how tame it was, even the rape scene was mostly people shouting behind a closed door.  It was nowhere near as scary or unnerving as the one in Deliverance.  In the end the violence was mainly psychological or limited, although the guy getting shot in the car and bits of you-know getting everywhere was a real turn-off.But really what did the movie in for me was the plot, or lack thereof. Supposedly we're getting an homage to film noir and hardboiled fiction novels of the forties, done up in a modern story theme.  What we see on the screen is a confused mess of people running around and doing the most stupid things.  It's not a horrid movie, but there's a lot better ways to spend a few hours.  
Overrated  C R A P	1	Norway	Yes, thats right. Crap. This film is just that. If you take a closer look at f.ex. Bruce Willis, who seems to make people scream their head off every time hes near the screen, you can clearly see that this person lacks personality. He has two expressions: One that says ON, (with a little wrinkle above his nose) the other is of course OFF, when hes asleep. a machine of a man, which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home, because hes in desperate need for a personality, some feelings, a higher IQ and an even bigger paycheck.Why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there. Voting, cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors, musicians, artists etc. That is why this world goes straight down the toilette. Making your modern remarks that everything is so Cool all the time.Pulp Fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director. There is no inventions, no good or natural acting, no deeper meaning with this movie at all. Just exploitation.The era of good movie-productions are long gone. Classic actors like Chaplin, Bogart, Cooper, Peck, Holden and Quinn dont get born any more. Today its just you gray and unpersonalized people out there (With some exceptions), watching to see if theres something that can kill your brain even more, with splatter and gore above your ears. Yeah, youre a really cool bunch, drowning on dry land. 
Totally underwhelmed	2	Manchester, England	This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.But it's fashionable, so it's popular.By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it. 
I'm afraid it's no good what-so-ever.	1	Croatia	What is it with this film? What IS IT!?!? Gangsters walking and saying absolutely nothing. A lot of idle and boring dialogue. Boring stories. Clich&eacute;d camera angles and borrowed materials from other films. And a whole lotta f-words to fill a space-cruiser. Some acting is good, but that's the actor for you...Everything else is empty, empty, empty... Peer-pressure and the moronic masses of people say this film is a masterpiece! How? Because they talk about Quater Pounders with Cheese? Because of the morale of the gangster? What morale? We cool? We cool. Yeah those phrases have absolute impact...ooh hoo, bobby!Yeah this is the movie that re-defined cinema... without re-defining it at all.Skip this trash and watch something else... for the love of movies,please do that! 
A creative and slick waste of time	1	United States	You want to do something really neat? Take the movie Pulp Fiction and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks. 
The most ludicrously inflated reputation of any film	1	Eel Pie Island	The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.Its only entertainment, I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two. 
The most overrated and unimportant film of the century	1	The Greater Southwest	 It is neat to believe in your heart that you are hip. And if you can obtain coolness by watching a movie, wow! I believe that everybody who says they like Pulp Fiction thinks they are cool. They think that a movie with such style and witty banter is only for the hip. The only problem is that this film is as empty as a Scottish pay toilet and perhaps the most pretensious piece of nothing ever. If you have not figured it out yet, there is no story here. Tarantino simply shoots a pointless movie and then breaks it up so that we do not see it in its proper sequence. So things that happen last come before things that finished before and vice versa. You start to wonder, gee, am I not intelligent enough to follow this? Then you realize, uhhh, no, it is actually fairly simple. He is just stringing a bunch of scenes along in no particular order. Then he gives unrealistic and long-winded speeches to characters that are not particularly realistic. It does not make the film really bad, but at the same time, it does not make it good either. You can paint a piece of crap all kinds of different colors, but it is still a piece of crap. I wonder if Tarantino has the talent to actually tell a real story without having to resort to fancy tricks, shocking scenes and other gimmicky tricks. I doubt it. Oh well, I guess I am just not that cool. I mean, Samuel Jackson sure did say some funny things. 
What a great but useless attempt........	5	India	Pulp Fiction is a movie all credited to its director....Mr. Q. T. This movie is such an amazing and fast track of events all tied up nicely and cohesively that one cant deny its grandeur.But here comes the boom. It is a highly un-required movie that is overrated just due to its above mentioned qualities. But when something is made there must be a purpose behind its existence but the film is so useless and itchy that in my opinion this film is not the best film in history of cinema. Yes the film has a huge potential to influence movie making and direction but it itself is nothing but a crap of laughable and senseless events.So to mention Sir i am not buying any of this movie but lets just consider the direction and cohesion of events. 
Crazyness all over the board	8	United States	for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vinces heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lances house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film. 
A few interesting moments but no classic	6	Stockport, England	Ive never really understood the love for this film. There are some good actors in it (Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Harvey Keitel), there are some mediocre actors in it (John Travolta, Uma Thurman), there are some very funny moments and the different stories colliding is an interesting idea. However all the characters are two dimensional and when Tarantino himself appears it becomes apparent that the characters are all him really: limited in imagination, mouthy, insecure and angry. Really Ive seen 30 minutes TV episodes with more depth and characterization. There are some laughs and genuine suspense but none of it really leads anywhere. Any time a character begins to say anything interesting another character has a sudden attack of tourettes and its brushed over quickly. It irritates me that one of the main characters dies halfway through but features in the rest of the film because its shown in a silly order. Its a bleak world-view and its not one I share. Id say this is an above average film but only just. 
nothing but a bullshit art-house stuff	1	None	i watched the film 20 years later since its making and attain 0% satisfaction of viewing pleasure considering its 5h top position on IMDb. The movie is an experimental art house crap that chooses no destination and lack brilliant, appealing sketching of its theme. The dialogues are the heartbeat of the film that lose its rhythm every moment when stretching same words to make viewers understood the characterss stand, view in perplexing crime world and how they perceive.The one thing, the film depressingly is in desire of clapping is Bruce Willis part of a boxer, who is feared but not a coward. The rare male protagonist with conscience.Uma Thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug, lust and hunger to live free.Tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity, but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty.I have watched it and guarantee You waste of time 
Pretty bad!	3	None	The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone whos afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema! 
Random scenes	1	None	The movie is as bad. If Aleksandr Nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful. YOur Tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of Aleksandr Nevsky. His movies are not badass nor funny. Aleksnadr Nevskys movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes. the movie has not script it was directed on the go. Tarantino no scirpt means bad business. I thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as Treasure Hunters by Aleksandr Nevksy but it is no. No no no just very really no. Avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch Aleksandr Nevskys movies. They are very underrated. Pulp fiction is overrated because Tarantino is no Aleksandr NEvsky. I know good you know bad. 
Violence and Redemption Underscore Pulp Fiction	10	United States	Pulp Fiction is considered Quentin Tarantino masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although its not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, Pulp Fiction has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between Pumpkin and Honey Bunny as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and were seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- hell drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasnt been working on the level of Pulp Fiction. Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallaces (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date thats not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When hes on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I dont know why it never gets old, but it doesnt. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with The Bonnie Situation. The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincents heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle thats cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, Reservoir Dogs, and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of Pulp Fiction has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in Reservoir Dogs you wont see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesnt quite flow like a Tarantino film that weve become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. Hes not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is The Gold Watch section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his Die Hard facial expressions, especially when theyre not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we wont care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard its pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. The Gold Watch has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. The Bonnie Situation may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally shot Marvin the face. The Bonnie Situation offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he walks the earth. Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesnt make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing Pumpkin (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be Pumpkin and Honey Bunnys last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways. 
Not very original	2	Long Beach, CA	 It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two. 
I hate this movie	2	None	 Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all-time.  I really don't understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  It's cruel, stupid, idiotic.  It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening.  It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.  That doesn't make it a masterpiece.  This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick.  The movie is SICK.  This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.  Everything else is idiotic. 
A groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking	10	Portugal	What can I say about Pulp Fiction that hasnt already been said before? That it is arguably one of the best movies ever made and that after twenty years since its release remains a dazzling and original piece of brilliant filmmaking? Well, of course I could say all that, but I still wouldnt be making this magnificent movie justice. Theres the amazing screenplay, exploding with pop culture references, and whose merits raise far above its plot and are really more related to the brilliant character development and the awesome mix of comedy and tragic that are so beautifully brought to life by the awesome cast. And then of course theres everything else, the amazing direction, the superb editing and the even more superb soundtrack. Tarantino has this ability to select an handful of songs that, far more than just cool and nice sounding (ala Goodfelas or Boogie Nights, for instance) manage to give meaning to the scenes in which they are played. And thats just one of the million things that makes this movie so special and above all with such an high rewatchability value. And among those things theres also of course the unlikelihood of everything we see happening on screen and the unfolding of events that makes glued to the screen even after dozens of views... Summing up my thoughts, Pulp Fiction is a groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking that still manages to dazzle and surprise audiences after 20 years of its release. Its not just one of my favorite movies, its also the movie that made me look at films from a different point of view, almost forcing me to love them as much as I love books. Please, if you havent watched it yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it. But get ready, cus its gonna be a bumpy ride! 
Pulp Fiction.	10	Cardiff	Quentin Tarantino has to be one of the best directors of the 90s and Pulp Fiction is without doubt one of the best films ever made. This film also has one of the best casts ever assembled, the list of big names is endless. If you havent seen this film then you need to watch it as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed. How it won just one Oscar I will never know, it defiantly deserved more in my opinion. If I had to describe it in one word it would be Cool, From Samuel L Jacksons speech to John Travolta and Uma Thurmans dance. When all the story lines come together it is magnificent, and it is one of the few films that deserves a 10 star rating. 
Pulp Fiction - A Masterpiece of Cinema	10	Portugal	It is one of the most important movies of the 1990s if not ever, because it put Quentin Tarantino on the map as one of the directors to look out for. Pulp Fiction stars Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and many many more and was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Why is Pulp Fiction considered a masterpiece? Because it has really well written dialog  the driving force behind this movie is the dialog, despite all the mob and gangster elements this movie has. If you love superbly written dialog in movies you will probably like Pulp Fiction. From the get going Pulp Fiction you know exactly what movie you are in for  great dialog, a lot of racial slurs and the movie being obscurely original. Instead of running in chronological order from start to finish the movies chapters are all mixed up in a really stylish way. Half of the fun you will have with this movie is piecing the movie together after the first time you watch it. Moreover the characters are awesome as well  Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make this movie, however they are not the only ones who make the movie great.Another thing that works for Pulp Fiction is the soundtrack. After you watch Pulp Fiction you will have all these songs in your head that will make you buy the soundtrack CD, because they are all so catchy. The songs are also very well edited into the scenes in this movie. A dialog based movie? That should be extremely boring, but in this case it is not  great acting, a great premise, great dialog, it even proves that violence can indeed be funny. 
One of the best films ever	10	Germany	I love this movie, it is a perfect mixture of crime, joke and wisdoms (Quarterpounder = Royal Cheese).Since today I have seen this film a dozen times. Cant belief that this film is over 20 years old! In my opinion this is the best Tarantino movie.Every time I can recognize new things. I love the para-language from John Travolta and the black humor from Samuel L Jackson.This movie has three different stories (Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace Wife, golden watch and Bonnie situation) with no time chronology. Since today I have no idea what is in the suitcase ;-). 
The Greatest Film Ever Made	10	None	This is a Masterpiece. Tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters, it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however, from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by John Travolta and Uma Thurman Pulp Fiction is perfection. I went into this film with high expectations, I had recently been introuduced to Tarantino through his previous feature, Reservoir Dogs (which was also very good) and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of Hollywoods best, Willis, Jackson, Travolta but there was no need to be as I was delivered a masterclass in film. A very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase, a risky move by Tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it. My belief is it contained his soul. The way in which Tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the least. 
Love this movie!	10	Brazil	Well directed, well produced, love the photography, and the script is amazing. Quentin Tarantino is one of my preferred directors, and the Pulp Fiction was the first film from Tarantino that made me start looking different for this directors work. The arc of this script is super well created, once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie. The photography of this movie is also amazing, very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie. The characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast. About Tarantinos direction, there nothing that I can tell ... in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax, at the right moment. One of the best movies I have ever seen. 
A Bit Over Rated But Good	7	United States	I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to its hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like its the only movie worth watching - like it is the King of Films. Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.7/10 
Pulp Fiction?	6	United States	Does he look like a bitch? proclaims Jules, the character played by Samuel Jackson. Holding a gun in one hand and a suitcase in the other, he repeatedly berates and interrogates his victim. The victim stutters in response. English, motherf*cker, do you speak it? Jules yells again. Vincent (the character played by John Travolta) rests easily on the wall as if this was nothing new to him. Before inevitably killing the poor man, he lashes out another series of vulgar yet shockingly hilarious slur of swears, punch lines, and bible quotes before pulling out his gun and shooting him to death. These quotes are not merely for shock value, and they are spoken in the climax of the movie. They appear within the first 20 minutes of the movie, and are some of the most quotable lines in movie history.This movie isnt intended for children. If the R-rated warning didnt already give that much away. The movie contains many instances of drug use and profanity. Although it is a movie about hit-men and the drug business, the central themes of the movie do not completely center around it. There is a deeper meaning to the movie itself. Not just every violent, gangster drug related movie can make it to top-ten movie lists (IMDB rates it number 5). While this movie is for adults, its also for the more intellectual audience. Morons will be attracted to the movie through its violence and profanity, but intelligent people will walk away with much more. The time line of the movie itself is jumbled and isnt portrayed in the way everything happened, and that alone takes time to figure out. The symbolism of Bruce Williss struggle to get his golden watch is not many will pick up on. Not to mention the symbolic right vs. wrong roles played by Jules and Vincent that inevitably lead to their separate fates. The characters, despite their rash language and dangerous professions all have redeeming qualities and are constructed individually and interestingly. Samuel Jackson, or Jules is more or less the main character who travels around with his companion Vincent doing various tasks for Marsellus Wallace(Played by Ving Rhames). Though all characters carry the same profession, all of them are different in their morals, attitudes, and composure. It doesnt come up until later in the movie, but what separates Jules and Vincent are their decisions whether to stay in the business or leave. This ultimately leads to Vincents death as he chooses to continue his involvement with Marsellus. Jules, being the more superstitious of the two, reaches a moment of clarity early in the time line of the story which enacts him to change his ways as he believes that a higher power is telling him to quit. Vincent and Jules contrast with each other, which in turn makes them the perfect combination. Vincent, more reserved. Jules, more sporadic. Vincent, a heroin addict. Jules, a clean man. Vincent, calm, cool and collected. Jules, loud and controlling. All characters intertwine themselves and hold various attitudes to each other that amount to gore, violence, death, and even rape. No character is looked down up on.The movie itself carries many references to pop culture and the movie is constructed around such. Vincent keeps his hair long and in a pony tail and Jules keeps his in a jerry curl  two styles relevant to earlier times (not to mention these hair styles somewhat reflect their characters). The movie for the most part is fairly present, if not a decade earlier than the year it was produced (1994). The music is mostly older music  from the 1960s and 1970s  and no real original score exists as any music played is from these periods in time. At one point in the movie, Vincent takes Marselluss wife on a date (not a real date, just good company as he puts it) to a 1950s diner where many famous celebrities can be pointed out, such as Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. The music is mostly American rock music, and it is fitting to a story that is very much American. 
One of the Greatest Dialogues for One of the Greatest Films Ever Made	10	United Kingdom	Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Quentin Tarantino. It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump.Pulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, a mob boss played by Ving Rhames, the mob bosss wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis. Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson. The part which makes this film so good is its dialogue. About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking, but the dialogue is so well written and interesting, you could sit and watch them for hours. This film deserved its Oscar by miles. All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions, are not going to be impressed due to its long, dialogue heavy scenes.It has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to read between the lines, if you want a film like that, then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick. Its a straight up entertaining film which you dont even need to watch all the way through once youve watched it a few times. This film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion, it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers List. 
One of the best movie I ever seen..	10	Sweden	This movie has is all.. Good actors, good story, and a helluva speed all through the movie.. You will never be bored when watching this movie.. With so many good actors in one movie, you could think that it would not be a good movie. But In my opinion, This is the Best movie John Travolta  Laurent Fishbourne ever acted in.. They both are in their peak performance.. One very cool thing about this movie, is that you may THINK, that you know whats gonna happened next... But believe me, you dont have a clue... I have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. And I could easily watch it 50 times more, without getting bored.. It deserves a BIG 10/10..If you havent seen it, go get a copy immediately.. 
Great Director, Great Movie	10	United States	Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time. It is not a coincidence, therefore, that Pulp Fiction, one of his most well recognized and known movies, is one of the best movies of all time. Between the eclectic and comedic plot and the supreme group of actors that Tarantino used for the movie, it is inarguable otherwise. For many people, for instance some of my friends who have watched Pulp Fiction, the plot is a negative. These people have got to be Type As who require a structured and well planned plot with a more developed and organized background and character set. They usually think this because the movie simply picks up at different places and is not in chronological order. The movie also introduces characters to the audience without any name, background or insight into the character. These two things can most easily be seen in the beginning and middle of the movie. In the beginning, when the Honey-Bunny scene is introduced for the first time, it is easy for the audience to be dumbfounded and confused as to what the movie is about and who the characters are. The audience may also be confused in the middle of the movie when Marsellus Wallace is talking to Butch. There are no obvious indications as to who the two men are. The audience has to draw from context clues that the black man is Marsellus Wallace and that Butch is a boxer who is supposed to go down for him. It is easy to see that this may irk somebody who has a Type A personality. To me, however, this is a very positive and refreshing aspect of Pulp Fiction. Movies are too predictable today. They present too many known and common variables. All of Quentin Tarantinos movies, or at least most are unpredictable. This unpredictability is refreshing. The randomness, especially in Pulp Fiction, is positive, new and makes watching the movie fun and exciting. Much of the randomness factor in Pulp Fiction comes from random little extras that mean nothing to the plot of the movie. An example of this is when Vince and Mia are on the date and Mia calls Vince a square. But rather than saying square, she outlines a square with her fingers in the air, and lines follow her fingers on the screen. Another random yet comedic part of the movie is when Butch comes home to his girlfriend Fabienne and she says she wants a pot belly. This is where the audience first learns that Fabienne is quite weird and oblivious. Besides these two scenes, there are many other strange little jokes or bizarre piece of humor intertwined into the movie. An excellent example of this is when Butch learns that the watch he receives from his dead fathers comrade was kept inside both of their rectums. Of course the vocabulary Tarantino uses for these for these scenes is quite vulgar, but the vulgarity adds to the hilarity factor. The actors are also part of what makes Pulp Fiction as good a movie as it is. Tarantino usually uses many of the same actors, especially Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken. Thurman plays Mia and Walken plays a more minor role. Besides Thurman and Walken, many acting greats including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson take major roles. In my opinion, Pulp Fiction is the best movie I have seen Bruce Willis play in as he does not play some cheesy, clich character with clich lines like in all the Die Hard movies. John Travolta also plays his role very well, as he also does not take himself too seriously. Samuel L. Jackson, in many aspects is the funniest and best character of the movie. His violent rants and outbursts are hilariously awesome and challenge his famous Go the _____ to Sleep. Pulp Fiction also leaves the audience with questions. The biggest question is what is in the suitcase. All that is known about the contents of the suitcase is that they glow orange and that Marsellus Wallace is the owner and needs them back. The audience also gets to see that anybody looking at the contents freezes and stares when they see what is inside. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought that the content was gold bars, which may explain the orange glow that hits characters faces when they opened up the suitcase. But, after investigation on the internet, unaware that the subject was of hot debate, I learned that Tarantino wanted the suitcase to hold diamonds, but used diamonds in another movie so he just did not show the contents at all. It is these small mysteries that add interest and debate over the quality of movies. Because of the actors, hilarity, and mystery in Pulp Fiction, it can be considered one of the best movies of all time. Tarantino did not disappoint with this 1994 movie. He intrigued many with a more artist and abstract way of making plots and directing movies. 
Pure genius!	10	United States	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. My favorite parts are the characters of Sam Jackson and John Travolta Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega. Quentin Tarantino did a fantastic job. Other movies have tried to compare but none will. My good friend out in Los Angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of Jules and Vincent driving around town and having a discussion about Vincents recent travels abroad. And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that its the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the gold watch speech to Harvey Keitels dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. He combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy. 
How to make a cool movie	9	Newcastle, England	Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just dont like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50 plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has COOL this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool. 
Great	10	Ukraine	Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La Joete. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic. 
Art in the film form	10	United States	The most fantastic movie Ive seen, its going to be considered classic even 100yrs from now. A must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art. I have watched this movie tons of times, and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant. Also Reservoir of Dogs is very recommended. One of my most favorite movies of all. I am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasnt yet trashed Hollywood. Have Fun watching and Happy Journey! 
Tarantinos Masterpiece	10	United States	Zany, witty, funny, stylish, classic and masterful. Pulp Fiction is my favourite film of all time. Its delivers its laughs through phenomenal performances from Uma Therman, John Trovolta, Quentin Tarantino, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson especially. Tarantino is one of the few film-making geniuses that hasnt graced the world with enough of his works. His visual excellence and stylish storytelling techniques are on complete display in this film. Tarantino also gives us an ensemble of characters with flawed and yet unique personalities only Tarantino characters have. His characters are impressive and yet very flawed, very human and yet each and every one of them manages to be ridiculously charismatic and witty. The writing in this film is absolutely flawless, providing one of the most quotable scripts in history. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary cinema that manages to be both effective and enjoyable. 
nomen est omen	6	None	When Pulp Fiction hit the theaters it had an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation. And Palme dOr cemented its reputation. Bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. Therefore it was a must see. And after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: Was that it?Some years down the line ive seen more contemporary TV shows from the US and it became clear why Pulp Fiction stood apart. As the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. Why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isnt. There were other things where Pulp Fiction excelled. For example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any CD collection at the end of the 20th century.The way i understood Tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. Although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it.Overall, Pulp Fiction is an exercise in marketing. The title, as well as authors statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. However, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating its reputation to being one of the best movies of all times. 
Still got it	5	None	Pulp Fiction has always been up there for me, and it has been a long time since Ive seen this film, but I marvel at its complexity, both in its form and its meaning.When Jules utters lets get into character at the beginning of the film(near the end, depending on how you look at it), Tarentino is forcing us to examine what is fictitious and what is real. His conversion at the end of the movie I think is the triumph of character and virtue over shallowness. He quits killing and decides to wander the earth as so many people of conviction have done(the Disciples of Christ as well as many other historical/religious figures.Moreover, this film is about protecting the dignity of people. While most of the characters are despicable, somehow they manage to save someone else in the film. Examples: When the junkie save Marcellus wife Mia; Butch saving Marcellus from further harm.In the end, Pulp fiction forces you to discern the difference between fact and fiction. 
Great film.	8	Suffolk, England	I dont deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it mustve been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesnt disencourage them. I cant help but resent the film for the fact its usually the film that gets people into film (cant disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesnt have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that Id like to know, to be honest. If it wasnt such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.8/10 
Master craft film making	10	United States	To put it simply this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino obviously spent a lot of time carving out this masterpiece. Quentin prides himself on being very talented at writing dialog and he proves it here more than in any other of him films in my opinion. Be warned though this movie is not for the faint of heart as it has sternum puncturing needles, drugs and a lot of violence. But that just adds to the movie for me. The plot lines are masterfully interwoven and the characters are lifelike and very believable. When I turned 40 I did something I always wanted to and rented out a movie theater and the one film that I chose for my friends and I to watch was Pulp Fiction. It is at the top of IMDbs top 250 and it is on AFIs top 100 for a reason, it is master craft film making and it is one of my personal all time favorites. 
Tribute to On the Waterfront	7	Toronto, Canada	 I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson:Marsellus: In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it.Butch: In the fifth, my ass goes down.Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In On the Waterfront Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando coulda been a contender. So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in On the Waterfront. I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention.Also, for Tarantino fans, watch Kiss Me Deadly (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside. 
Ladies and Gentleman, fasten your safety belts as the cine-bar has been raised!	10	United States	The first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie. Brilliant and engaging, endlessly quotable and visually alluring, PF made all the top lists, regenerated John Travolta, solidified Bruce Willis, centered Samuel L. Washington as a leading man and cemented Christopher Walken among creepiest of cameos ever. The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest. They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner.... and we actually see very little violence play out! Tarantinos use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as its charm. Imbecile gangsters charming? Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy? When combined , it remains a perfect storm for Quintin  company. 
Classic Pulpy Amusement	8	Fraggle Rock	Its no surprise that Pulp fiction is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clich&eacute;d and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also theres a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. Theres also a certain ambiguity about it. Its not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then theres the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt theres anything to say about Pulp Fiction that hasnt been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing. 
A violent, vicious and egregious movie	9	India	There are movies that open you up, and make you feel relaxed. Some of the movies can give you strength and make you feel hopeful. They are full of messages. But there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself shit! what did I see? That is so vicious! or something similar.It is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself shit! what did I see?. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again. Hats off to direction.Thats why the name :Pulp Fiction 
Love-Hate:   Been There/Done That	6	United States	From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all. 
Energetic and imaginative - making up for it's lack of real heart with a great wealth of dialogue and characters	9	United Kingdom	 Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable. 
the best movie ever	1	United Kingdom	To contradict my summary line, this film is actually one of the least appealing films I have ever seen. Its violent, disgusting and crude, and none of these are particularly bad traits, its just that it offers me nothing, and leaves me with an emptiness, the fact that I have wasted 2 1/2 hrs watching this, then not to be compensated.This is entirely my opinion, and clearly mine alone. Nearly everyone loves this film, and they are honest enough to clarify it, but if my review is completely the opposite, I still feel compelled to write.Im sorry, but 9th on the list of the top 250 films, seems grossly inappropriate. 
Honestly, do people talk or behave this way?	1	USA	 Golly, everyone is falling all over themselves about this one.  Why, please? It's silly violent, nihilistic, pointless.  And every character has the same way of talking -- talking about clever things in that pseudo-way that only Quentin could possibly dream up.  Ooooooh, the talent! Pass. 
Disgusting	1	Cologne, Germany	 This is one of those movies (like Fargo) which expects the audience to laugh about the most cruel scenes of violence. That's not only disgusting but even dangerous, because in spite of It's only a movie, you know we all should know how influential screen behaviour might be, don't we? 
worst movie ever	1	U.S.	 After 4 years, I still consider this the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have yet to watch any thing else with QT's name attached to it. Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably. 
Not the classic that the critics say	6	Chicago	 I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of multiple narratives in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of Rashomon, which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the banality of evil, but the hard-boiled dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in Reservoir Dogs (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares? 
Jaw dropping	8	United States	Quentin Tarantino takes you on one wild ride in this movie with the out there dialogue, the violence, the music, the drugs, the dancing and the 50s themed diner! The overall message of this spectacle in my opinion is that eventually you have to come down,whether it is from the high of blowing people away, from snorting heroin and over dosing and getting a shot of adrenaline in your heart to going back into a dangerous situation to do the right thing even when you want to run away. This movie is fast paced, laugh at loud funny at times and sometimes blush worthy but most importantly it is unforgettable. This is a modern classic that should not be missed. 
Masterpiece	10	Canada	I first saw Pulp Fiction around 2009. I must have been 14. Little did I know this movie would grab me in a way no other has. Im normally not the type to re-watch a movie less then a year apart, but within a month I had already seen Pulp Fiction twice and by the end of the year I had probably seen it about 7 times. Over the years Ive seen it at least an additional 15 times now, often showing to friends who havent seen it and It still never gets tiring to watch. Tarantinos brilliance is still unparalleled today. The dialogue is the likes of which no movie has come to match since. Pulp Fiction is a timeless movie that never gets boring no matter how many times you see it. 
gangsters thriller	10	None	Known as a gangsters bizarre thriller, pulp fiction was directed by Quentin Tarantino and released in the year 1994. Starring Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, and John Travolta (Vincent Vega) and Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winnfield) as two criminals, this film won two Oscars and cost 8 million dollars. Jules and Vincent work for their mafia boss Marcellus Wallace. He is dealing with Butch Collidge, a boxer who failed to lose a fight on purpose after taking Wallaces money and is now planning to leave the city, but he cant because he lost his fathers watch. Vincent faces some problems when Wallace asks him to take his wife Mia out for a good time while hes away. The movie is presented in a series of chapters where the lives of unrelated people are put together in funny and black comedy events. The ending is very much unexpected. Pulp fiction was a 90s classics and the best gangsters thriller Ive ever seen. The performance of the actors is amazing, the script is brilliant and the music is excellent. This film appeals to an audience of over fifteen who love thrillers. 
Perfection Fiction	10	United States	This is perfect storytelling, acting... An instant classic : an homage to B movies of the golden age and very modern in his conception at the same time. Samuel Jackson plays Tarantinos screenplay like a music instrument, John Travolta seems to be back from the dead, Harvey Keitel is hilarious, Uma Thurmans part is so moving, Bruce Willis is so badass, Maria de Medeiros so cute... Every songs of the soundtrack are unforgettable. Each frame absolutely gorgeous... Tarantino is a genius and his love for cinema explodes everywhere in this movie. With Wild at Heart by David Lynch, its one of the greatest rocknroll Palme dOr in movie history. If you havent see it yet,how lucky you are ! 
Great Movie	10	None	Great Movie I recommend it to everyone who hasnt seen this film. Its filled with action, suspense and terrific drama. Great for fans who love 1970s film. Sam Jackson, John Travolta and the cast did a great job is selling their characters. Tarantino, the director had the worst performance of the cast. He should stick to directing. The end of the film was special. I dont want to give it away but to end with the start of the film was creative and I bet this concept will be copied by upcoming directors for years to come. This movie will live forever and will be considered a classic. classic story telling, great dialogue and unexpected drama and action. Go see it! But be warned, you will be spoiled. You will expect all movies to be this good. 
review	10	United States	Pulp Fiction is just one of those movies that you always hear about but maybe have never seen. This movie is so different and interesting, director Quentin Tarantino really made a breakthrough film with this one. the camera angles were a really big appeal to me when watching this movie. The over the shoulder shots, as well as camera shots that were point of view shots, were very interesting. The camera was often angled down low and tilted slightly in many scenes which added a cool twist to the average eye level filming we see. The diverse cast of so many well known actors worked so well together to create a film as interesting and different as this one. 
Simply brilliant!	9	Belgium	Taranino is one of those people you have to understand and respect to like a movie like this one.Im pretty sure by now most of.. everyone, has seen this movie. And either you LOVE IT, or you dont like it at all. This is widely spoken not the kind of movie about which youll say Err, Its OK...I myself am i big Tarantino fan and absolutely love this movie! Its action, humor  entertainment. Good casting and superb acting! This movie creates an environment that youll without a doubt want to see develop!If you havent seen it yet, and dont really know what to expect.. JUST WATCH IT ALREADY! :D 
Easily one of the best films of cinematic history	10	United States	Quentin Tarantino has taken a spot as one of the best and most influential directors of all time. Two years after his success with his debut film Reservoir Dogs, he took his director skills up to next level in this 1994 black comedy Pulp Fiction. This film boasts a strong ensemble cast of actors including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keital, Uma Therman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Maria De Medeiros, and Eric Stoltz. Told in a nonlinear prospective, the plot follows the separate lives of their characters and how their lives untold in events that lead to their fate. The movie mixes elements of violence, humor, and satire, creating one of the most memorable and quotable movies of all time.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play two mobsters, who acquire a briefcase containing a secret item, and are assigned to protect it for their boss Marcellus Wallace (played by Ving Rhames) while facing troubles along the way. Travolta and Jackson put on some mesmerizing performances and showed incredible chemistry between each other. These two were probably the best characters of the whole film. Bruce Willis plays a professional boxer, who is caught up in a kidnapping plot while obtaining a watch from his father. Uma Therman plays the wife of Marcellus Wallace, who is invited on a date with John Travoltas character, only to face a serious dilemma involving heroin. This part includes one of the most shocking scenes where John Travolta makes an unprofessional attempt to save her condition. Then there is Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, who play a Bonnie and Clyde-like couple, who rob a local restaurant with unexpected circumstances. Director Quentin Tarantino also has memorable cameo in one scene with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.The most memorable aspects of this film is not only clever dialogue and Tarantinos unique style of cinematography, but also how amazingly well the characters are written. Quentin Tarantino did a great job at giving each character proper construction. This film is packed with a number of characters, but does well on making sure you remember each and every one of them. While the plot is a bit scattered-shot, the film manages to be entertaining in every way. Pulp Fiction is not only Quentin Tarantinos best film, but also one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. 
A Masterpiece	10	Liverpool	The film that perpetuated Tarantino to an icon in the history of cinema is without question this one. Pulp fiction is written in such a way that even though it isnt filled with wall-to-wall action it glues the audiences eyes on the screen from beginning to end thanks to its snapping, self-referential dialogue, layered engaging characters and at the time revolutionary form of storytelling. The film focuses around several plot lines all of which somewhat connected in their own Shakespearian way, and of course the mysterious contents of the briefcase. Another strong feature in the film is the stellar performances from Jon Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman (all of which were nominated for academy awards as a result) who brought their A-game to the set, each delivering famous, ultra-quotable phrases throughout the film. Yes Pulp fiction is a timeless classic that will live on throughout film history. 
A very interesting movie	10	United States	Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hit men with a penchant for philosophical discussions and their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames); his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman); struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis); master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, Pumpkin (Tim Roth) and Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer). Wallace has also asked Vincent to take his wife Mia out a few days later when Wallace himself will be out of town. This movie is a series of less-and-more related but separated short stories of crime and comedy that each result into an unexpected ending including unexpected deaths, sudden twists, black comedy events and horrific conclusions of crime and its following consequences. The theme of Pulp Fiction is power when Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the film. The theme of power is very prevalent during Jules Winnfields scene at the apartment and with one of the most controversial aspect of the film, which is the literal use of the N-word. When you watch the movie, you can tell that Marsellus has some severe power over all the actors in one way or another. Since I dont have a massive list of movies I watched, I cant really make a reference to another film due to the fact that of the films I watched, none of them match what pulp fiction has for its theme. The film uses the motif of the control Marsellus has over the characters, by using shadows to stay hidden and the fact that he is merciless, like when Vincent hears that Marsellus threw someone out the window for giving his wife a foot massage. When Marsellus is on the screen you can clearly see that the other characters are scared of him. The lighting of the film is very appropriate and it looks like there is a bunch of natural light when the scenes are near windows or outside and the use of the lights from the bulbs in the indoor scenes, where the light comes from those bulbs and not from an external source of light (studio lights to make the scene brighter). Fear and power are some of the easiest ways to gain respect from people, but it can lead to having some of your people to oppose you. 
Truly a classic	8	None	There is not doubt when it comes a list of films that everyone loves, this is one of them Thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.And whither Tarantino? Thats the real question. His career didnt actually begin with Pulp Fiction, what with the auspicious start he made a couple of years earlier with Reservoir Dogs (1992). And Pulp Fiction of course certainly wasnt his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol. I and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and ambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But lets be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more like Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasnt moved much beyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, hes still earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it too, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a measure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films in him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new directions, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways as a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus. Which isnt a terrible thing. Pulp Fiction is a remarkable movie. But, hey, we thought thered be more. 
Pulp Fiction...	8	United Kingdom	Pumpkin and Honey-Bunny are in a diner having breakfast discussing where should be the next place where they should rob, they decide that the best place to rob would be the diner that they are sitting in. They hold-up the restaurant. It then cuts to Jules Winnfield and Vincent Vega who are on their way to collect a briefcase for their boss. He toys with the three people who is collecting the briefcase from before executing them after reading a passage from the bible. After this it shows us Vincent Vega who is taking his boss Marsellus Wallaces wife out for dinner. However, before he does this he goes and buys some heroin from a person called Lance. He takes Mia out to dinner and after winning a twist competition he returns back to Mias house and when he goes to the bathroom, Mia finds the heroin in his coat pocket and mistakes it for cocaine before overdosing. Vincent finds her and rushes her to Lances house before they manage to give her an adrenaline shot to bring her back to life. We then see a young boy sitting watching television before a Vietnam veteran shows up to give him a gold watch that has been passed down to him by his father who had died. The young boy is Butch who grows up to become a boxer. After agreeing to go down in the fifth round with Marsellus Wallace in his boxing match, Butch kills his opponent and escapes the arena.

When him and a crooked cop take Marsellus into another room, Butch manages to escape. Instead of escaping he decides to help Marsellus and goes back in with a weapon and sees Marsellus getting sexual acts performed on him by a crooked cop when he kills the shopkeeper Marcellus escapes and shoots the crooked cop but doesnt kill him as he wants him to be tortured by some of his friends. Marsellus and Butch then decide to forget about their problem with each other if Butch fleas the state and if he doesnt mention about the rape. Butch and his girlfriend drive away on a Chopper. Then it cuts back to Vincent Vega and Jules when they went to retrieve the briefcase, another man bursts out of the bathroom and fires a round of bullets at Vincent and Jules and after escaping death Jules believes that it was an act of God that they didnt die.

After the remove the car from the road they go to Jules friends house and he is not happy because his wife is due home from work and thinks if she comes home then she will be really annoyed and he could get divorced. They hire the help of Winston Wolf to help them get rid of the blood and skull from the back of the car. After they manage to clean the car and get rid of their bloody clothes, they get some new clothes and drive off. Vincent and Jules decide to go to breakfast where the robbery takes place involving Honey-bunny and Pumpkin they ask Jules for the briefcase that he is going to deliver to his boss but he refuses. Still Shaken up from the supposes miracle that happened he decides that he is not going to kill them and after quoting his passage from the bible he leaves the diner with Vincent.This film starred: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Maria De Medeiros, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Ving Rhames, Eric Stoltz  Christopher Walken.PULP FICTION was released in 1994. This was a really good film by Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino wrote and directed this film and it is a really fun watch. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson were class in this film and so was Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Walken and Eric Stoltz. My favourite performance in this film was Samuel L. Jackson as Jules Winnfield his acting in this film was great. I still havent seen Samuel L. Jackson come close to matching his performance in this film although he was good in DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE. I also really like that this film is jumbled up with its chapters and I had fun with piecing the film together. The dialogue was brilliant and I highly recommend this film. Bruce Willis was really good as Butch and I actually found it really funny in the gimp scene although quite disgusting when Ving Rhames is getting raped. Christoper Walken did really good even though he had only a small role as the Vietnam veteran and Harvey Keitel was good as Winston Wolf. Credit to Tarantino for writing and directing this film as well as having a minor role in this film because he did good in that role also.****/***** Very good. 
Its a good movie but its definitely not flawless, its far from that.	7	Belgium	I dont think it is as good as many people think it is. Im definitely not saying its bad, in fact its far from bad, but I did think that the fact that the movies time was out of order was really unnecessary. A movie with no order in the time is supposed to make you ask a a lot of questions in the beginning. A great example of a movie like that is Tarantino s Reservoir Dogs. There were a lot of questions to be answered in the movie. The only question I asked myself in Pulp Fiction was Why are Jules and Vincent wearing beach clothes in the bar?. In fact, I wouldnt even ask myself this question because its really stupid. I thought the movie would have been just fine without the scrambled time.It has been considered that Tarantino is the king of dialog. I have to disagree. Admittedly the dialog is pretty entertaining in the first scene but overall, the dialog was pretty normal but in the scene where Vincent took Mia to a fancy restaurant, it was a boring scene to me because the dialog was just a rehash of what Vincent and Jules were talking about in the first scene. Afterwards, the unexpected dance everyone is talking about was pretty boring. I expected John Travolta to do sick moves but he just did moves anyone could mimic. What bothered me the most in this scene is the fact that Mia did coke in front of EVERYONE in the bathroom. Was it legal in the 90s? If not, its definitely a huge flaw. Overall, this scene could have been skipped.The movie is a dark comedy and there are some hilarious moments. There is one joke that was very unfunny to me. It might not be a very big deal to you but it is a big one to me. Its the moment when Captain Koons said that Butchs great grandfather stuck the watch up his ass. It is an overused and clichd joke. I expected him to hide it somewhere else more disgusting because the movie is a dark comedy. It might have been funny in 1994 but I dont care how funny it was back then, it wasnt appealing to me.Now for something positive. There is something I really liked in the movie and that is the style of filming. it was filmed in a way where the cameras wouldnt move most of the time. This style is a personal preference of mine but I am giving it extra points for that. And who can forget the brilliant performances? Although it is unfair to me that John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson got a lot more credit than Bruce Willis even though he had a much more exiting story but its not part of the movie so dont worry about it.

Thats thirty minutes away, Ill be there in ten.	9	New York	Tarantino delivers a masterpiece with Pulp Fiction. The master of quick- witted dialog doesnt fail to deliver, there is never a moment of boredom within the film. Watching through it just once, it is impossible to understand and grasp just how many references and criticisms there are to and about pop culture. The movie is highly stylized and distinctly carries its own identity, and Im not going to give away any plot points because this is a must watch, so Ill be as vague as possible. The movie seemingly has no linear plot structure since it jumps around a lot, and that is an understatement. With that being said, it just is impossible to lose attention from the viewer, but it is possible to get lost in the content, which is why it is more than deserving of multiple watch- throughs. 
Pulp Fiction - An Iconic Journey	10	Ohio	Pulp Fiction is a movie that begins and ends in the same place, a diner. This being said, the movie is not just a single layer film. Pulp fiction has layers upon layers that build upon it. Major characters and bit players all contribute to the convergence of story line in this film. To watch it once does not truly do it justice. To appreciate the film, the viewer needs to take in every moment. The movie follows the movements of 2 mob hit men (Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield) played by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson as they try to obtain and return a briefcase containing some unknown glowing beautiful item. This movie is better understood if it is pictured as a giant circle. When the movie starts is actually where its ending. This could be considered madness or genius on the part of the Director, Quentin Tarantino. As the hit men try to get the briefcase to their boss, Marsellus Wallace, played by Ving Rhames, they encounter a boxer who is trying to stiff Marsellus, named Butch played by Bruce Willis. A memorable scene in the movie involves Uma Thurman who plays Marsellus wife, Mia. Vincent saves her from overdosing on cocaine. As the movie unfolds, each nuance plays into the overall plot of this film. The theme of the film deals with the truth of human nature. Pulp Fiction doesnt delve deeply into each characters background, history or story; it merely gives you a small bite of the character. An example of this is when Mia asks Vincent about Amsterdam. He states that he just got back after being there for 3 years. Not why he was there or what he was doing there, just that he was simply there. This film focuses only how each character plays into the overall purpose of Jules and Vincent getting the briefcase to Marsellus and then weaves each character into the plot. When we meet Butch, we find out why his fathers watch is so important, but we never meet the father. Tarantino only wants us to know how the watch leads to his encounter with Marsellus. Each character is merely a representation of a type of person: The hit man, the mob boss, the boxer, the mob wife, etc. Tarantino likes a lot of dialogue in his films. Some cannot get past his excessive use of profanity and long conversations. He uses this in most of his films, such as Kill Bill which has been dubbed a revenge film, but there is a lot of dialogue throughout the film that leads the viewer on the journey to revenge. Two important elements in the movie are the importance of visual imagery and the use of music. From the iconic scene at Jack Rabbit Slims with the retro theme to the basement at Maynards shop with the gimp to the inside of Jules car after he accidentally shoots Marvin, visual imagery is key. Music is also very important, again at Jack Rabbit Slims during the Twist Contest when You Never Can Tell is playing and again later when Mia comes back home and is dancing to Girl, Youll Be a Woman Soon, each song creates the scene for the audience. The soundtrack for this film is still head and shoulders above the all others and to this viewer is the most memorable part of the film itself. When Pulp Fiction came out, people rushed to buy soundtracks to movies and this proves why. Each song has a purpose and its purpose, just like the entire movie itself, is pure genius. 
Original, Iconic, Simply Brilliant	10	United Kingdom	Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the most influential films of modern times, inspiring writers and directors throughout the late 1990s and into the 2000s, and has also stamped its domination over pop culture for the last 20 years.Indeed, Pulp Fiction is writer/director Quentin Tarantinos magnum opus, and hes never quite reached the dizzy heights of this feature, which offers something to the audience that many films rarely do: a realistic script. While non-linear stories arent a new invention (thats not to say it isnt perfectly well crafted here, as it definitely is), Pulp Fiction opts to convey plot and character development to the audience through conversations between characters, in a screenplay where the viewer can imagine that these sorts of interactions could happen in real life. This is refreshing to see, as many films through exposition around like primates with their dung in a carbohydrate-abundant enclosure. In all honesty I cannot think of a script which delves into so many topics: foot massages, T.V pilots, fast food restaurants, life in The Netherlands, the conflict between faith and fact, 1950s celebrities, blueberry pancakes, what it feels like to kill someone, choppers, tea towels and gourmet coffee.Expert script aside, Pulp Fiction is fantastically directed and paced, as each segment in this non-linear story keeps you invested and interested, a notoriously difficult feat, where you could loose your audience at any moment due to confusion or, unfortunately, boredom. Well acted on all accounts, especially in Samuel L Jacksons Jules, but also with the other cast: Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, and even John Travolta in the role which revived his career for a while, and lets not forget Harvey Kietels legendary appearance as Winston Wolf.All in all this is a superb film, unmatched in its screenplay and dialogue which will make you laugh, quake with dread, and most of all: think. Has been my favourite film since I first watched it, and so far nothing has topped the bill. 10/10 
Mexicans, out of the f****** kitchen!!!	10	None	Above is actually my favourite line from the entire two and a half hour film! Anyway, Pulp Fiction is awesome! I have many favourite films, but, if there is one I can sit down and watch at any time, it is this! Tarantinos masterpiece is...well...a masterpiece! This is as flawless as it gets (no film is flawless). When Tarantino started making movies, I dont think anyone thought that a small-time indie filmmaker could create something so mesmorising and brilliant. This film is driven by the dialouge. I mean, a few guns go off and a couple people get stabbed and, of course, they are very important to the picture but the dialouge and the story is what really drives the film. The dialouge between Jules and Vincent is some of the greatest dialouge I have ever seen! From burgers in France to people getting thrown out of windows for giving foot massages, its just really, really, really, so, so , so, so, so,so well written. Vincent sitting down with Mia at Jack Rabbit Slims and the not-mindless- boring-getting-to-know-you-chitchat is nothing more than perfect. Then she over doses on potent heroine (which she snorts, thinking it to be cocaine) and what unfolds after that is true storytelling! I could go on forever about how great Pulp Fiction is, but I cant, so, I rate Quentin Tarantinos beautiful piece of moving art, a 10/10. 
The best film ever	10	Spain	Quentin Tarantino is the Jerry Lee Lewis of cinema, a pounding performer who doesnt care if he tears up the piano, as long as everybody is rocking. His new movie Pulp Fiction is a comedy about blood, guts, violence, strange sex, drugs, fixed fights, dead body disposal, leather freaks, and a wristwatch that makes a dark journey down through the generations.Seeing this movie last May at the Cannes Film Festival, I knew it was either one of the years best films, or one of the worst.Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, hes in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. Its that very lack of caution and introspection that makes Pulp Fiction crackle like an ozone generator: Heres a director whos been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take screenwriting classes that teach them the formulas for hit films. Like Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction is constructed in such a nonlinear way that you could see it a dozen times and not be able to remember what comes next. It doubles back on itself, telling several interlocking stories about characters who inhabit a world of crime and intrigue, triple-crosses and loud desperation. The title is perfect. Like those old pulp mags named Thrilling Wonder Stories and Official Detective, the movie creates a world where there are no normal people and no ordinary days - where breathless prose clatters down fire escapes and leaps into the dumpster of doom.The movie resurrects not only an aging genre but also a few careers.John Travolta stars as Vincent Vega, a mid-level hit man who carries out assignments for a mob boss. We see him first with his partner Jules (Samuel L. Jackson); theyre on their way to a violent showdown with some wayward Yuppie drug dealers, and are discussing such mysteries as why in Paris they have a French word for Quarter Pounders. Theyre as innocent in their way as Huck and Jim, floating down the Mississippi and speculating on how foreigners can possibly understand each other.Travoltas career is a series of assignments he cant quite handle. Not only does he kill people inadvertently (The car hit a bump!) but he doesnt know how to clean up after himself. Good thing he knows people like Mr. Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who specializes in messes, and has friends like the character played by Eric Stoltz, who owns a big medical encyclopedia, and can look up emergency situations.Travolta and Uma Thurman have a sequence thats funny and bizarre. Shes the wife of the mob boss (Ving Rhames), who orders Travolta to take her out for the night. He turns up stoned, and addresses an intercom with such grave, stately courtesy Buster Keaton would have been envious. They go to Jack Rabbit Slims, a 1950s theme restaurant where Ed Sullivan is the emcee, Buddy Holly is the waiter, and they end up in a twist contest. Thats before she overdoses and Stoltz, waving a syringe filled with adrenaline, screams at Travolta, YOU brought her here, YOU stick in the needle! When I bring an O.D. to YOUR house, ILL stick in the needle! Bruce Willis and Maria de Medeiros play another couple: Hes a boxer named Butch Coolidge who is supposed to throw a fight, but doesnt. Shes his sweet, naive girlfriend, who doesnt understand why they have to get out of town right away. But first he needs to make a dangerous trip back to his apartment to pick up a priceless family heirloom - a wristwatch. The history of this watch is described in a flashback, as Vietnam veteran Christopher Walken tells young Butch about how the watch was purchased by his great-grandfather, Private Doughboy Orion Coolidge, and has come down through the generations - and through a lot more than generations, for that matter. Walkens monologue builds to the movies biggest laugh.The method of the movie is to involve its characters in sticky situations, and then let them escape into stickier ones, which is how the boxer and the mob boss end up together as the captives of weird leather freaks in the basement of a gun shop. Or how the characters who open the movie, a couple of stick-up artists played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, get in way over their heads. Most of the action in the movie comes under the heading of crisis control. 
Tarantino Pounds Mirth And Mayhem into An Outrageously Funny Postmodern Pulp!	9	India	Quentin Tarantinos mesmeric Pulp Fiction is a slow dance on the killing ground, a prodigious horror-comedy spun out with such ferocious comic glee and buoyancy that belie its seeming cruelty. Superficially set in the gang haunts, streets, bistros, apartments, pawnshops and eateries in the cheesiest corners of modern Los Angeles, this dizzily convoluted noir plunges us into a kind of retro-nightmare fantasy land (formed of Tarantinos own pop-drenched experience) that keeps looping back on itself and traps us in a cul- de-sac of double-crosses, absurdity, arousal and danger, never completely sure of where anyones going or why  creating a sheer directionless excitement that only Tarantino can conjure. The structure itself is wickedly ingenious: Three interconnected stories, bracketed by several preludes and a few codas, are told deliberately out of sequence, with the same cast - a bloody band of outsiders - popping up everywhere. Most of the characters are familiar - the boxer who refuses to throw a fight (Bruce Willis), an obsessive war veteran (Christopher Walken), a mob bosss jaded wife (Uma Thurman), two desperate young lovers starting a crime spree (Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer), a pair of single-minded hit men who operate within a twisted code of honor (John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson) - but Tarantinos approach to their behavior consistently avoids the stereotypical. By and large these mugs exist in a moral vacuum which, for Tarantino, is the ideal atmosphere for cracking jokes while cracking open heads. Their tales all start slowly, but soon everyones destiny plays out as the stories dovetail into outlandish twists. Stuff happens in Pulp Fiction, exhilarating, jaw-dropping, visceral stuff but Tarantino weaves the stock stories into an amazingly coherent whole. Unlike other action-thrillers, this movie gets its charge not from action pyrotechnics but from its electric barrage of language, wisecracks and dialog, as the lingo takes on a murderous eloquence - a verbal swagger. The tension Tarantino creates between the threat of guns and the greater threat of verbal fusillade is electrifying. Its hard to imagine any viewer leaving this extravagantly demented low- life lollapalooza without carrying away at least a few indelible moments. The entire cast, like Tarantino, also seems to revel in sloshing around in this muck, each one of them having a time of their lives.Pulp Fiction also makes it clear, despite its gory content, that Tarantino isnt just some punk nihilist on a sick joyride; his movies are all about consequences. There is a moral core in Pulp Fiction too- a subversive one. But ultimately this is also what makes the movie so unexpectedly buoyant. Despite the drugs, the blood, the language and the grit, Pulp Fiction is fundamentally light-hearted. Its fluff! 
Brilliant	9	None	I just started on IMDb and came across this great classic Tarantino Movie. Is there anything that anyone could add to what has already been said...classic, awesome, love it :-) I have not seen any really bad Tarantino movies...Often wondered if there could ever be any kind of follow up to this...John Travolta shows off his usual dancing skills with The Chuck Berry Classic You never can tell Probably made more famous from this movie. Its hard to believe how along ago it was...even if it is watched today it is timeless.....that must make a great movie..keep it classic. The fact that you can watch it timed time again is great...if you were flicking through the channels of the TV and this was half way through...you would watch it again until the end...That tells a story. 
This is One of the Best Pieces of Work Ive Ever Seen!!!	10	USA	Tarantino is too gifted a filmmaker to make a boring movie, but he could possibly make a bad one: Like Edward D. Wood Jr., proclaimed the Worst Director of All Time, hes in love with every shot - intoxicated with the very act of making a movie. Its that very lack of caution and introspection that makes Pulp Fiction crackle like an ozone generator: Heres a director whos been let loose inside the toy store, and wants to play all night.The screenplay, by Tarantino and Roger Avary, is so well-written in a scruffy, fanzine way that you want to rub noses in it - the noses of those zombie writers who take screenwriting classes that teach them the formulas for hit films.

Great Stuff	9	United States	Definitely a dream come true movie...different scenarios and full of comedy and action. I would recommend it to those who are seeking a thrill and want some action themselves...I especially love the dark/mysterious tone to the whole plot. A true is not really polite to gesture...but this film was spot on. To those who love thrillers...this is a piece by piece film.Very good movie but some scenes lacked emotion.I wonder if this film gets more money through donations. Die Hard was also a similar film tone. Loved the various change plots. 
A thrilling exercise in style and substance	10	United Kingdom	I remember that back in the mid-90s, when Tarantino-mania was in full swing, the motor-mouthed former video store clerk-turned-auteur was always surrounded by controversy. His two movies, Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction were portrayed as cruel, violent and sadistic by the media, while movie critics swooned over his pulpy, reference-heavy characters and innovative dialogue. Over 20 years later, Tarantinos films seem laughably mild compared to the casual ultra-violence of most 18-rated movies regularly released today. But while Reservoir Dogs can arguably be dismissed as a marvellously scripted and meticulously acted rip-off of City on Fire (1987), Pulp Fiction seems as fresh as the day it was released.The black-suited duo of Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winfield (Samuel L. Jackson), and the misty-eyed gangsters moll Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) have been reduced to movie icons, adorning the walls of students and making it easy to forget just how well written they are. Tarantino is fascinated by the humdrum of these casual killers lives, and their conversations about cheeseburgers, foot- massages and what constitutes a miracle sparkle with invention, intelligence and laugh-out-loud humour. It makes these cartoon characters, who seem they have been ripped straight from the pages of a book found in a dime-store book shop, seem real. Even though they have just shot two unarmed men in cold blood, you would still want to buy them a cup of coffee and pick their brains.Pulp Fiction, as Im sure you already know, tells three intertwining stories out of chronological order. After successfully obtaining a briefcase belonging to their boss, hit-man Vincent Vega is given the responsibility of looking after the big mans wife, Mia, for the night. He takes her to a retro diner where they talk pop culture and dance to Chuck Berry, and the nights events then take an unexpected turn. Travolta makes for an astonishingly sweet killer and heroin addict, and this story in particular sizzles with sexy dialogue and real chemistry between Travolta and Thurman. The now-infamous scene of an improvised adrenaline shock still has the power to make you wince, while remaining funny and utterly absurd all at the same time.The second story, The Gold Watch, focuses on ageing boxer Butch (Bruce Willis), who after failing to follow thorough with his role in a thrown boxing match - organised by Vincents boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) - flees to the safety of a hotel room and into the arms of his lover Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros), who he intends on whisking overseas along with his wad of stolen loot. However, upon realising that Fabienne has failed to pack the gold watch handed down to him through many generations and eventually by his fathers friend Captain Koons (Christopher Walken), he must return home to reclaim it. The events that transpire are some of the most outlandish work Tarantino has ever done, filled with gunfire, mutilation, rape, and a gimp. Such relentless brutality may have been off-putting, but Tarantino keeps you reassured that its okay to laugh at what youre seeing, that its only a movie. Its a textbook lesson in black comedy.The narrative then jumps back in time to Vincent and Jules in the aftermath of the hit seen at the start of the movie. After an extremely gory accident, they are forced off the road and seek the hospitality of Jimmie (played by Tarantino himself). They hire professional fixer Winston Wolf (Harvey Keitel), who races against the clock to clean up the mess before Jimmies wife arrives home from a night shift. The film climaxes at the diner shown in the opening scene, as Vincent and Juless quiet breakfast is interrupted by a husband and wife stick- up team (Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer). The third segment is the funniest and features the most memorable dialogue, as Winston tries to motivate an objectionable Vincent (pretty please, with a cherry on top, clean the f*****g car,), and Jules educates his new foes following the life-altering miracle he believes he has just witnessed.Featuring highly on practically every best of list from 1994 to the present, Pulp Fiction needs no introduction and I doubt it ever will. Though I have enjoyed all of Tarantinos movies with the exception of 2007s tedious Death Proof (though it fares better when viewed in its Grindhouse entirety), I dont rate him as a truly great film-maker, as I dont feel he has ever managed to shake his compulsion to homage. But Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly a masterpiece, like nothing else made before or since (though many attempts have been made in vain). A thrilling exercise in style and substance, beneficial to cinema as a whole and responsible for re- igniting a few careers on the way. I cannot see Tarantino ever topping his achievements here, but then again his movies never fail to surprise me.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com 
Absolute masterpiece	10	None	Reading through the reviews for this film, I was shocked to see so much negativity (relatively speaking)! I really dont understand why anyone would not enjoy it - I could easily say this was one of the best films I have watched in my entire life. Not only was the simplicity of the story a great base for it, everything about the film gave it an unbeatable quality, with the amount of detail put into every sketch of it, as can be expected with Tarantino. I believe what makes the film so appealing is the dialogue (ideas, words and general execution of it) which is present throughout, start to finish, from simple conversations, to the monologue given by Jules towards the end. It makes the two hours of film fly by fast, but remains with one for a long time afterwards. Really, everything about it contributes to the greatness of the film. Its both hilarious, intense, and bloody enough for my liking. I am a huge fan of Tarantino in general, and I believe this movie is very representative of him and deserves all the acclaim it has received.Honestly, I could watch and rewatch this film hundreds of times. Absolutely amazing. 
Real Gritty Yet Smooth	5	United States	All the actors in this film are the best. They are the best because they are all driven to be the best, in a casual, yet f off kind of way. From what I gather, they dont care about the reviews, they are just that far into their characters, which makes for the best kind of film. This movie brings new light to the term cool. I give this film a 10 simply because its real, in a dog eat dog gritty way, Pulp Fiction is a movie I can play on repeat, even with the mistaken over dose scene, and blood, every time I watch it, I fall in love all over again. Real life, if real life came to your front door with a gun. From personal experience I would go into this movie with an absolutely open mind, and freshly open brew. 
Love this movie	10	Santa Monica	A masterpiece through and through, i figure by now everyone knows and has reviewed this movie but what the heck its that good and that timeless/classic. Everything is on point from the story, to the story telling, to the actors, to the music chosen and all the little side conversations/side storys. Some scenes are shot in one long take and really make you feel like your there more than a mash of different shots. Riddled with memorable lines and almost an feeling of cool in the air as odd as that may sound. A bit graphic and harsh at times but is never pointlessly violent, just enough to feel real. It doesnt more fast beginning to ending but when it does move fast it goes as fast as humanly possible. I have enjoyed every Quinten Tarentino movie Ive ever watched but this takes the cake for me as the best and has yet to be duplicated 
Pulp Fiction paradox	10	Moscow, Russia	Pulp Fiction paradox no doubt comes from the individual director. Contrasting specifically demonstrated the love of violence and found at the dump film garbage gems their real ego humanist and idealist , Tarantino was one of his best films. Dramatic ideally divided into three separate stories, harmoniously living space of one film, Pulp Fiction exists under the laws road movie. From the beginning of the road dives to the same dives in the final - seems to be circling round and round on the spot, this movie still does a huge way. Therefore Fiction (as, in fact, all the other Tarantino films) remained in history whimsical set of quotes , and alive, just pour in cinematographic reality. And the Olive Branch with Oscar for the most modest scenario of the possible rewards. 
Great movie in so many ways	10	None	A movie that is beautifully directed, with a great acting crew, fresh duologues, that is fun to watch and difficult to understand completely. It is different from many other movies in a lot of ways: from the nonlinear narrative to the unpredictable plot twists, it manages to keep you glued to the TV and is never boring. Quentin Tarantinos fans should definitely see this movie, since it may as well be his best one so far. And if you are not, than maybe this is the movie that will make you one And dont forget to read about all its different meaning s and hidden messages. :D I wont say nothing more, in order not to reveal same spoilers.
