To call it a sequel is a travesty	10	None	 This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.  
The Greatest Film Ever Made	10	Canada	 The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (Keep your friends close ....., I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent. 
One of the Best Sequels Ever	10	Canada, ontario	 You can count on one hand the movie sequels that measure up to the original; GODFATHER II makes the cut. This movie is just as fine as GODFATHER I. Here the director goes back and forth between the early days of the young Vito Corleone, played by Robert De Niro, and the family after the action in GODFATHER I in the 1950's just before Castro came to power. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has moved the family and most of his business to Nevada. Once again the acting is flawless. Diane Keaton as Michael's wife who quickly becomes disillusioned with her life with him and the lies he continues to tell her, assuring her that he is going legitimate soon; Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted brother and adviser; and Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth all give outstanding performances; but the film really is Al Pacino's. We see him become a ruthless, cold-blooded killer who alienates himself from his family in ways his father would never have done. He has come so far from the idealistic young man in GODFATHER I, who joined the Marines in World War I to serve his country and die for it if necessary, to a lonely, paranoid tragic man. There are many poignant scenes concerning his wife and children-- the drawing his son leaves for him in his bedroom, the gift that Tom buys the child because Michael is too busy, his wife Kay's being kept a virtual prisoner at his orders in the family compound, etc.Once again many acts of violence are interwoven with religion: Michael's son's first communion, the religious parade in New York, Fredo's repeating the Rosary in order to catch a fish, for example. The cinematography is stunning; the footage from Sicily and New York around the turn of the century and the snow scenes from the American West are beautiful and rich in detail. Mr. Coppola has directed yet another masterpiece.  
Great ensemble acting, great story, greatest sequel ever made.	10	Derbyshire, UK	 The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see. 
Breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur...	10	Mexico	Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by The Godfather, Part II in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters... 
The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made, one of the greatest films of all time and possibly finer than its superb predecessor *****	10	United Kingdom	The Godfather Part II (1974)Number 1 - 1974Top 3 - 1970sMy father taught me many things. Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closerThe Godfather Part II is truly a masterpiece. Timeless, Classic, Beautiful and endlessly watchableThe second part of Francis Ford Coppolas Epic and violent Gangster Trilogy, follows the reign of Don Michael Corleone as the head of the Corleone family. As well the film shows us the early years of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and respect. Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part II exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy Award winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro. The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made. This is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppolas second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part. As close to perfection as movies getPacino at his best-10/10- 
Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under sprawl	9	New York City	Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in the role of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the inside was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended flashback segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call J.K. Rowling Syndrome. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the d&eacute;nouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see. 
A Masterpiece	10	United States	The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part of this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I was very surprised by this. The story is amazing, everything makes perfect sense. The Oscar winning screenplay is amazing, the dialogue is some of the most original, and realistic ever putt on screen, the characters are flawless, and it's in every way perfectly written. The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless. 
One of the greatest sequels ever made	10	United States	 After seeing The Godfather and improving it as one of my favorite films, I wanted to get more into The Godfather so I rented this. Words can't describe how great this sequel was. The acting once again was amazing and the story and how the movie went on just never got me bored. Everything in this movie was clearly beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more. You have to see this movie because it's just brilliant filmaking. It's not better than it's first film but still an extremely worth sequel.10/10  
A Hollywood Masterpiece!!!!	9	USA	 Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, The Godfather.  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb. 
The Greatest Sequel During  the Cinema's History	7	United States	 The Godfather, Part II is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5. 
An Insult To Call It A Sequel	10	Queens, New York	To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and youll see Im not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleones life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one. 
Terrific continuation of the Godfather series; to call it a sequel almost seems insulting...	10	UK	This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as sequel is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like The Matrix Reloaded is a sequel - The Godfather Part II is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in The Godfather Part II, Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. The Godfather was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. The Godfather Part II may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a sequel almost seems insulting. 
About as good as the first one, but mainly because of De Niro	10	Denmark	 It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10 
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Godfather of all sequels	10	India	The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vitos death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michaels journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brandos portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppolas brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzos masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rotas poignant score and Gordon Willis vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/ 
As good as the original...	9	Canada	Sequel to the original Godfather is slower moving than the original but maybe better. The first was fresh material and Brandos presence was a huge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today.Michaels descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. Hey, its not easy holding a crime empire together. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? Its a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.Pacinos performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when Michael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. Pacino just nails the part.The secondary story is the rise of Michaels father, Vito Corleone and we watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part, if that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don Fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of Death himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. How many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiros look? What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of its generation is convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales visibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know right then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on him. By DeNiros expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man. Thats unsurpassed acting.The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900s New York, in the Italian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. Thats sheer magic. Once again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie.Some weak points: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the other actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual, especially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito vs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their empire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see where the results have taken both.One of the greatest films of all time. 
Sorry, but it just didnt deliver	5	Mexico	OK. Lets get real. The Godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. Im not giving comments on The Godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. Nevertheless, I expected much more on part II. Personally, I didnt like it. Heres the deal: the story was way too slow paced. Nothing really happened. Only the hit on Michaels house, and the build up for young Vitos story was what makes you interested. The rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs werent as quotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation of the real thing.Al Pacinos performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasnt that. The whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he talks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once had. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. Now, his son is just pure evil. And that doesnt make sense. In the book, its clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So, what happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesnt kill anyone from his own family (not the Family, the real one). I know, Michael did kill Carlo, but lets remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another thing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive Dons daughter to... Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. Its interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppolas anatomy for each Godfather. You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it wasnts that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.Another flaw I found was that the story doesnt really stick to the book. One key aspect in the film didnt even appear in Mario Puzos novel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who had his family killed doesnt even matter. Still, the scene prominently explains Don Tomassinos condition from the first.Now, dont get me wrong. Im a die hard fan of The Godfather. I consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). But part II just doesnt do it for me. 
A decent follow-up but not great as far as  Im concerned	7	Canada	The Godfather: Part II hit theatres a couple of years after the first film and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it is routinely listed alongside the original as one of the best American films of all time.The story picks up a few years after the end of the first film. Michael is firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to Nevada where he is edging the family towards legitimacy. However, when he is beset by betrayals he systematically sets about dealing with the betrayers mercilessly. There is also a second story thread (told in flashback) that traces the early years of Vito Corleone and his introduction to mob life.The film clocks in at a hefty 200 minutes. Unlike the first film, though, I couldnt really get caught up in either of the parallel stories so the film seemed to drag quite a bit. I didnt find the Vito storyline particularly compelling and the Michael storyline is little more than a convoluted extension of part one. These stories were meant to be compared but I dont feel that the director or the editor really constructed the film optimally for this purpose. Nevertheless, the film still has a classic scene or two, though its nowhere near as consistent as the first film.Most of the actors whose characters survived the first film reprised their roles here. Returnees Al Pacino  Talia Shire each landed Oscar nominations and so did newcomers Michael V. Gazzo  Lee Strasberg. However, the only actor to take home an Oscar statuette was Robert De Niro for his portrayal of the young Vito Corleone. Personally, I think that Pacino gave the best performance of the film.Francis Ford Coppola won an Oscar for his direction but I feel that the first film was a better effort. From a visual standpoint the film is attractive, though, and the Nino Rota score was justly rewarded with an Oscar.Ultimately, I dont feel that The Godfather: Part II lives up to its pedigree. Ive watched it a few times, so Id say that Ive given it a fair shake. That being said, I realize that Im in the vast minority here so it must be a personal thing. As far as Im concerned, Chinatown deserves the Best Picture Oscar that went to this film. 
Not Far Behind The First Film	9	United States	This isnt quite as powerful as the first Godfather, done two years earlier, but it isnt far behind. Its another magnificently filmed effort, wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once youve put it in your tape or DVD player.What makes this a notch below the first Godfather is the absence of Marlon Brando and a little too much disjointedness with flashbacks. Also missing from this film was the volatile James Caan. He was shown in a flashback scene near the end, and that was it.One thing was just as good if not better than the first film, and that was the cinematography. The browns, blacks, greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes. I especially love the Italian houses and scenery. Why this was not even nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography is mind-boggling.The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael (Al Pacino). It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.There are some excellent supporting performances in this film, too. I especially would cite the roles played by Michael Gazzo and Lee Strassburg. 
Overwritten Script Takes Away from What Could-Have-Been	9	United States	The sequel to The Godfather, at times, was just as impressive, and sometimes even more impressive than the original. Overall, though the film struggles with its flashbacks to an early New York as we watch a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rise to power. The Godfather II, wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. When were in the present time watching Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fight off Senators that are trying to squeeze him, or when were watching his house get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone very close to the family we always find our self in amazement. When we jump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. The script is to blame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in its near three hour run time. When were in the early 1920s we see things that are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to being on par with the present day status of the Corleone family. Its good to know and see how the godfather started out, but theres too much to say and not enough time to say it. The bloated section of the film becomes underwritten. We dont really learn anything about Vito Corleone that we didnt already know. We dont really see how he gains his power. He kills The Black Hand, and one day, through rumors, he becomes the Don of the city. Just like that. Just like that? Really? Then we come back and hes all of a sudden in the Olive Oil business. We dont know how he got there or anything, hes just there. De Niro gives it his best, but hes just not working with anything to give any kind of performance thats remotely on the same level as Brando did in the previous film. I found it painful to watch De Niro try to imitate Brando. When we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its convincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art direction, are very good. We never see big wide shots of the city block. We see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly moving camera. Coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too far (Probably didnt have the budget to make a huge set of the city), but we get a claustrophobic sensation. The kind of claustrophobic sensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close enough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a sack full of guns. Coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very well. There are some great moments in the flashbacks, but I could have lived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much better film (Possibly better than the original). When Michael finds that his own brother, Fredo (John Cazel), knew about the assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and that he never told Michael about his connection with Hymen Roth and Johnny Ola, it infuriates Michael to the point of no return. He feels as though he loses his family. When he confronts Fredo, he doesnt say much; hes sick of him; Fredos too stupid to have around, and he cant even look at him. Coppola direction here is magnificent. Even though its dark and you cant see the reactions of both of the men, theyre both in the picture with the light shinning through the windows creating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body language, and the body language tells us everything we need to know.Cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish we got to see more from his character. Hes so good in this one scene that it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge part of that is due to him. The words that come out of his mouth are on par with Marlon Brando speech in, On the Waterfront. All this frustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. Hes pleading with his brother. We watch him spill his guts on the table, and admit that hes well aware of being stupid and feeding into that stereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel his pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and callousness of his family. He feels like an outsider, a coward, and a loser. All the while, Michael sits in front of the window looking at the boathouse. He doesnt care what Fredo has to say, which makes it all that more painful to watch for the both of them. Michael wants information from him, and thats it. One feels like an outsider, and one is an outsider. Neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins both of their lives. Fredo wants respect and power. Michael has the power, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he ever cared about: his family. Its one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history. 
It had nothing to do with business	7	Ruritania	In the movies, sequels have always been difficult. The franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. While the following decades saw the rise of the TV series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. Today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. That tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to The Godfather.Being a drama, The Godfather Part IIs biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. Al Pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. John Cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making Fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. Welcome returns are also made by Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. However the greatest turn is that of newcomer Robert De Niro. De Niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of Marlon Brandos middle-aged Don in The Godfather. Its still only a small demonstration of De Niros talents however.Perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. Take, as one example out of many, the scene where Pacino and Lee Strasberg first meet. Roths wife greets Pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way Coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. Coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as shes not a character we need to remember, he doesnt allow us to connect with her visually. This is really intelligent filmmaking.But The Godfather Part II is more than ever about stunning imagery. With a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, Coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. This is especially true in the young Vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and the production design team lead by Dean Tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. Its intriguing how Coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of.And yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. There are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the Cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. This inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying Theyre carving up Cuba  geddit? But instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have Hyman Roth going on about his stupid cake. And whats more, there are too many references to the best ideas in The Godfather  the dark Lake Tahoe office where Michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end  all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. None of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. The Godfather Part II is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. In fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel. 
Godfather II Stunk	4	United States	Godfather Two is Coppolas movie---and he had no instincts for the mafia. The Godfather author, Mario Puzo, objected to having Michael kill his own brother, but finally gave in to keep his share of the Hollywood millions.Godfather Two has lightweights as heavies: the drunken New York mob guy and Hyman Roth cant compare to Barzini, Sollozo, and the other heavyweight bad guys of the original Godfather written by Puzo.Godfather Two loses the atmosphere of the mob while it meanders lengthily into Cuba.The main point that makes Godfather Two inferior is that it does not contain a single sympathetic character.The endless scenes in the Lake Tahoe home of Michaels are tiresome, dreary after a while, and lack interest as compared to the original Puzo story.This movie shows a deterioration from the original, just as the mob has deteriorated in recent years.Coppola had no right to think he could write his own Godfather, and his inferiority to Puzo when it comes to dealing with the mob shows up here in technicolor.Meanwhile, poor Mario Puzo watched his story being degraded by the instinctless Coppola, objected at first, and then gave in. Pathetic.The only scenes that actually ring true here are from the original Puzo book (the earlier life of Vito Corleone).The contrast between the dreary Coppola script of Godfather Two and its dreary characters is brought home strongly by the final (flashback) scene where Sonny Corleone and the others are around the table. As soon as Sonny appears, everything comes to life. 
A few historic flaws, but one of the best glimpses into turn-of-century NYC	8	New York City, NY	What else can be said about The Godfather series? One small gripe: The storyline shows young Vito Corleone (Robert Deniro) murder the local boss, then basically take control of the neighborhood. Historically, there would have been a dozen other guys in line to take the bosss spot -- young Vito, with no real connections outside of his petty thief neighbor, would have been disposed of immediately. In real life, bosses were bred into the position or it was taken hostilely from the inside. By the era that this movie portrays, Sicilian black handers and Neapolitan Camorra (among others) were fairly organized -- But, hey, its a (great) movie :) 
In Some Ways Even Better Than the First One...	9	United States	Seven years after the first film, Michael Corelone (Al Pacino) continues his familys quest to become legitimate. Also, more on his fathers growing up in Sicily and coming to America. With Vito being played not by Marlon Brando, but Robert DeNiro.) If you liked the first film, you will like this film. If you didnt, you wont. Its really that simple, since you have all the same great people coming together for this film with just as solid a script and acting as you did the first time. You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone? I cannot make any suggestions for part three, though, one way or the other. 
I really think this is the greatest movie ever made...	10	New Zealand	Wow. This thing is almost three and a half hours long and yet it is not boring for a second. Not one moment. From the very first scenes up until the tragic and forlorn ending, this film seizes hold of the viewers consciousness and does not ever loosen its grip, even when the credits roll. I walked away from the movie with what felt like a deep resonance inside me. It is at once heart-wrenchingly sad and stunningly beautiful.Thematically, it actually shares much in common with later films such as American Beauty and Fight Club. The Godfather Part 2 is the story of a man who seems to have it all - but the only things he ends up not having are the only things that truly matter to him. Michaels character arc continues on from the first film, creating a great, epic tragedy and what I think is one of the saddest and yet most majestic endings in film.I havent even talked about the more technical aspects yet. This is because I dont have to - everything is perfect. Not just great, but perfect, as in there seems to be no way that they could be improved on. Acting, direction, cinematography, script and story. Everything.The one thing, though, that clinches it for me is that the plot doesnt really matter. This is a movie about themes and ideas. The plot is quite thick, so dont worry if you dont get it - you dont have to. As long as you understand what the film is really about... you will walk away knowing that you have witnessed something almost life-changing. 
The Greatest Movie the World has Ever Seen...	10	India	I personally think that this film surpassed the glory of The Godfather I. you will have to watch it time and again in order to understand the nuances of its brilliant film-making. the characterizations are exceptional: 1. Micheal Corleone (as the new don torn between family & business) 2. Hyman Roth (as the scheming old villain) 3. Kay Adams Corleone (as the worried wife) 4. Robert Duvall (as the loyal lawyer) 5. John Cazale (as the betraying brother) 6. Robert DeNiro (as young Vito) etc. etc.... Its just Brilliant!!! Speaking about the film-making the parallel narration of two different but interlinked stories is a fresh new lease of screenplay. the cinematography is outstanding. the indoors are lit up beautifully with overhead lighting which puts a shadow over the characters eyes making it impossible to say what theyre thinking. But unlike the first part where they had broken all the rules (the characters are established first before the place and time) in this film theyve come back to the rules (the locations are established before the characters) Francis Ford Coppola should definitely be given another chance to make a sequel to the trio-logy so that the present generation can also experience the Magic of the Movie and for anyone whos not seen this film, I bet theyre surely missing something in life... 
The Godfather: Part II	9	Seattle, WA	Its not easy to be a son, Fredo. Its not easy. Is undeniably the best sequel ever made and one of the best films ever made. First off, Robert De Niros performance as the young Don Corleone completely owns. Pure genius, pure craft.Secondly, well its Pacino, all Pacino. One pure example, at its best is when Diane Keatons character confesses to him  it wasnt a miscarriage revealing that instead she had an abortion, so that she wouldnt bring him anymore sons into the world. Watch Pacinos face during this entire scene!!!!!!!! Or the last flashback scene where Michael reveals that he has joined the Marines to the disgust of his family and such, at this time he had his own  dreams now, we simply watch the price which Michael Corleone has paid himself for power. 
Astonishingly unapproachable, bored me to tears	8	None	I have been forced to watch the Godfather trilogy by a friend of mine who thinks, as do most people, that they are the best thing since sliced bread. I found The Godfather just about watchable, but no more - I would have given up if my friend hadnt been there, but this was completely intolerable. I couldnt follow who the people were (and didnt care) I couldnt relate it to the previous film. I couldnt relate the 1930s stuff to the 1950s stuff. There is no excitement no tension, no nothing. A complete waste of an evening. And its so interminably long too. Im having trouble filling out my ten lines for the review, because the film left almost no impression on me - except that feeling that I used to get at school when I was forced to sit through the most boring lesson in the world. And God help me, Im going to have to watch the third one. Like taking cod-liver oil. Ugh. 
Best Supporting Actor - Robert De Niro	7	London, England	 After the success of 'The Godfather' and having been turned down for a part in the first film, Robert De Niro follows hot on the heels of Al Pacino by being cast as the younger version of Vito (Marlon Brando). In it, we see a 30 year old Robert De Niro being taken from being a clean cut young man, probably not as striking as Pacino with his large brown eyes and dark hair, but interesting to look at none the less. Although not innocent looking, De Niro goes from being clean cut to being the gangster that we have come to know and love in the 80's and 90's at the guiding hand of Francis Ford Coppola. No wonder he won the award for 'Best Supporting Actor' to Pacino's leading role. As a whole, the film wasn't as cinematic as the first one, the range of characters that dominated the predecessor was not there is this follow up. However, the film was dominated by Robert De Niro, and it's almost a pity that De Niro and Pacino didn't meet. They would have to wait until 22 years later when they would team up in 'Heat'. 
Tremendous follow up to The godfather though Brando is missed	6	India	Part II in The Godfather saga carries on in much the same vein though Marlon Brando is sorely missed. The plot has Al Pacino exerting complete dominance as mafia boss in the fifties. The film also depicts young Vito Corleones (Robert De Niro) early years. This segment is slightly nostalgic but superbly acted by De Niro who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. As a result of the film moving both backwards and forwards in time, it feels more convoluted than the first part. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton both impress. The shocking climax (MINOR SPOILERS) mirrors the ending of the first film. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10 
The perfect sequel	9	London, UK	The accepted wisdom about sequels is that they tend to be less good than their predecessor as there is no story left to tell. The second Godfather is an embarrassment of riches in as much as there are two stories; the back-story of Vito Corleones arrival in America and that of Michael making good his grip on the inherited business.All the fine film-making that made the first so rich has been replicated and improved in this most handsome movie. Again we begin with a great set-piece (a Catholic confirmation) as a swarming expository melange of character and situation but which takes its rather more sober tone from the films prologue, telling of Vitos flight to America. The familial infections that poison this particular, warped Italin-American dream are doubly intense given that Michael is now the capo - where the threats of the first came from without, now there is danger within.Pacinos performance is first-class, never once resting on the laurels of his previous Oscar nomination. He is matched across the board by the rest of ensemble; Diane Keaton, Duvall and the twitchy Cazale are fine, and Ive always been a fan of Talia Shire whose performance as the Michaels widowed sister is a magnificent, discreet study in intractable sororial bitterness and love. A deeply sad and violent movie but one which never rules out the possibility of sympathy or redemption. An awesome achievement. 9/10 
As good as the original!	8	None	I remember saying in my review of The Godfather that i was going to review this film a week later, that was more than one week ago thats for sure. I did actually start watching The Godfather Part II the next Friday, though i stopped watching after an hour because i wasnt really in the mood for it! So i decided that today, with nothing else to do, id give it another try and i wasnt disappointed! It was a great film, lots of talking but its still great fun to watch. I only have one criticism, the length. It was extremely long, about 3 and a half hours! But thats my only criticism, everything else was spot on! Hopefully ill be watching The Godfather Part III soon and as soon as i do, ill post my opinion right here! So overall, The Godfather Part II is just as good as the original Godfather If you havent seen this film yet, watch it now!9/10 
Great Movie. Another Winner from Francis Ford Copolla	9	United States	Warning! Spoilers Ahead!The Godfather, Part II is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movies strengths lie in Copollas retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesnt differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.Pacinos Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous scream to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper: one minute hes calm, the next hes in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keatons performance is usually cited as the weakest of the Godfather saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinemas most memorable characters. One minute hes a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian tarantella; the next hes viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michaels control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played The Turk Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasbergs Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the films main antagonist. Roths true evil is only revealed in other characters dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasnt fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we dont actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous This is the Business Weve Chosen speech he gives to Michael.Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We dont see much of Fredo in Part I, but hes essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naivet&eacute;, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roths scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that there was something in it for me!, but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredos ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga: fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a Hail Mary, right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the family business. Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael loses his family, in terms of his wifes abortion and departure, and Fredos treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michaels mother tells him you will never lose your family. This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copollas further career is debatable. Radio host Phil Hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of Copollas career: what do you mean Charlie dont surf?!) He directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. This is a highly recommended movie. 
Parts of the Book That Were Left Out in Part One...	8	United States	...are included in Part II. This movie gives you the backstory of Vito Corleones rise to power, from the time his father is murdered in Sicily until he makes his bones and creates his own empire in the United States. Robert DeNiro is very convincing as young Vito Corleone in what was, if memory serves correctly, is his big screen debut. I was almost convinced he was somehow related to Marlon Brando, he had the voice, the looks, the mannerisms, everything. Couple this with another story not included in the book of betrayal within the family while Michael tries to make a move in pre-Castro Cuba and you have a sequel that is every bit as good as the original. Michael has been stripped of all his humanity in this story, and he comes across as being a cold and heartless human being, one who would even have his own brother killed to preserve his nefarious empire. The ending is heartbreaking because he realizes that he lost his family trying to save it. And the soundtrack in this movie is even better than the original GODFATHER soundtrack. For the third time, Im going to give a perfect 10 to this movie. 
Best movie I have ever seen	9	United States	I got the privilege to watch this film for the first last a few days ago. This has to be my favorite film of all time, along with one of the best films that I have ever seen.The movie does very well in shown two different two stories in one movie. You have Michaels story of which shows his struggle in controlling one of the most powerful crime families in the United States. The second story is Vito Corleones struggle as young boy in Sicily growing up and coming to America, and his start of the Corleone crime family.This is a long film to watch, it took me a few days to watch it, as I watched about 30 to 40 minutes at a time.All of the actor and actresses preformed there roles very well, and the actors and actresses who got Oscars for their roles in this movie were VERY WELL deserved. Robert De Niro does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in film, in my opinion one of the best actors in 1974.The script is well written and for the most part is easy to follow.If you seen the first film, which is a must to understand this film, then you will like the second one, which is one of the best films of 
One of the best films of all time	6	Canada	The Godfather II, in my opinion, is just as good as the first. So rare is it for a sequel to be as gripping and as well-made as this movie is. First off, I have to mention the excellent musical score. It gives the film a sort of dark, moody atmosphere, and I think it was a very good idea to use the same score as in part I. Secondly, the idea of inter wining the story of Michael Corleone and of his early father Vito was brilliant and makes this sequel stand out from the first part. This idea of showing two stories in one film could have been quite risky and confusing but Coppola did a fantastic job at it. Both stories are very clear to follow and show the contrast between Vito and his sons way of handling the family business.Of course, I cannot comment on this movie without mentioning Al Pacinos awesome performance. He definitely should have won the best actors Oscar for that role. He has unbelievable screen presence and plays incredibly well the ruthless, suspicious Michael Corleone. The most poignant scene of the film, in my opinion, is definitely the one where Michael finds out at the party that his brother Fredo betrayed him. 
The Economics of Destiny	7	London, UK	 Sequels rarely rise to the level of the original, and almost never surpass them. This phrase has been used so often in reference to The Godfather: Part II  the exception that makes the rule. What is even more laudable is the fact that the original is generally considered as a landmark in the history of film.This is one film that proves cinema to be a form of art, and not merely one of entertainment. A skilful direction from Francis Ford Coppola, outstanding performances from the likes of Pacino, De Niro, Gazzo, Strasberg, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton, Shire, memorable cinematography from Willis, a soundtrack by Rota, Coppola and Curet Alonso, and an ingenious script by Coppola and Puzo (partly adapted from his novel), make The Godfather: Part II stand out as a story of courage, love, treachery, and devotion, crafted in the life of the Corleone saga.The plot follows the consolidation of power of Michael Corleone, and his desire to gain the legality of his business, and the consolidation of power of a young Vito Corleone, and his desire to build a better life for his family. The old story of the father handing his wealth to his sons, gains a new twist by allowing a positive outcome to the original story. The wealth remains in the family, but there are losses to be incurred. An ontological thesis of Pareto optimality into the organisation of social structures is subtly brought into the view, without harming the general development of the story.The Godfather: Part II remains also as a text book for any actor. Al Pacino shows that temperance can be dramatic, making us empathise with his character even when made to realise the most brutal of actions.  Robert De Niro is purely outstanding, in one of the best supporting performances the screen has witnessed. His charm, charisma, and vocal skills, help him achieve a complete transition to Puzo's Vito Corleone. The viewer is unarmed in the choice given between murder and love, between life and necessity. Talia Shire stands out as the lost woman in a world dominated by men.Even if The Godfather is the point of reference when it comes to great cinema, The Godfather: Part II remains a powerful example which proves that there is always more to say in a story, and the additions can be more than surprising.  
prefer the deniro flashbacks	8	usa	 someone made the comment that he didn't understand why the flashbacks to don corleone's rise to power (with de niro as don vito) were included, that it romanticized the Mob.  i think the reason that we have the 2 stories is that they parallel each other.  while we are seeing how michael corleone is developing as a mob boss and as a man, and what forces are shaping him, we also see the same things in his father's early life - how don vito reacted to events, how he made plans and how he became the man he was.  although both men lived a life of crime the difference in the two is striking and real - don vito worked his way out of poverty and immigration and tried to help his fellow italians in a way that seemed to work for him.  don vito never lost his sense of caring for people in general and that they depended on him.he never lost his love for his family.  he never lost the common touch, the things that would endear a man to a community and win their loyalty.  when we look at michael in his criminal growth we see he becomes a completely different man - cold, ruthless, uncaring and increasingly isolated both from his family and from the greater community.  don vito actually served, however wrongfully, a purpose in his community and did some good - he provided political and financial assistance, and a basic justice to many people who would have been denied it otherwise.  michael corleone however is just a nasty, vicious, unfeeling, opportunist who does not have the same human touch his father did. and i think that is the main revelation of the 2 movies and why we have the flashbacks.  frankly i prefer the first movie, and the flashbacks in the 2nd movie - don vito was a better man. 
Hate Michael by the end.	6	Alexandria, Virginia	 By the end of this classic sequel to The Godfather, I absolutely felt nothing but hatred for Michael Chorleone.  Even though he waited until his mother faded off to kill Fredo, I still couldn't feel anything for Mike. But when you see the last shot of the film, you realize that he is going to regret it for as long as he lives and will fall into a deep depression for the next decade or so.  How could he be so mad at Fredo for being tricked by those two rats, Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola. That wasn't exactly all Fredo's fault. But, you not only do you feel the neglect from Michael to Fredo, but you feel the neglect from Michael to his family and household.  That was one of the really haunting parts of the film.  Michael's neglect is what causes him to fall into the deep depression by the end of the film and into the third installment of the trilogy.  Francis Ford Coppola has a true gift in film making and to this day remains one of the best directors in the business. The best of the trilogy.10/10 The best film ever made. *****/***** 
Touching perfection...	9	Greece	Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of The Godfather the The Godfather: Part II. The Godfather: Part II is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba.In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. The Godfather: Part II is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title Touching perfection..., but it continues to be the best sequel of all times. 
Travesty abounds.	9	United States	The Godfather: Part II is not a sequel in the traditional Hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in The Godfather. Here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers Michaels reign as the new head of the Corleone family by moving the business to Nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young Vito Corleone came to power and started the story now being continued.Francis Ford Coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner Mario Puzo to expand on Michael and establish Vito and doing so by going back and forth. This leads to some incredible shots of the young Vito and the young Michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. It also shows how far Coppola has come in terms of directing these films. Once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between Michael and Vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story.All this aside, I havent even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. The flawless acting continues here with Al Pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as Michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. Indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different Michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and the tragic John Cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and Robert De Niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal Vito.Once again, Gordon Willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. This adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and I cannot argue. They are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make.The final two scenes are quite something to behold. The first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for Vito to surprise him on his birthday. Here, we see how Michael truly was treated and how Sonny, Tom, and Connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. The final scene is Michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. It is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. And these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity. 
pretty amazing	9	None	Youre not allowed to dislike this film either. This is a massive achievement in every possible sense. Indeed, there is little that rivals these two films in opulence or production scale.Coppola doesnt shy away from trying new things. Michael Corleones story-arc is more realistic, more ambitious than anything in the first film. The scale of crime is upgraded. And I had never expected to see that scene between Michael  Kay, where she tells him of her departure, because of this 2000-year-old Sicilian thing. Vito Corleones backstory follows the earlier, more conventional combination of style and myth. Actually, Coppola makes Vitos arc too obvious, as though hes following a checklist. But again its very tastefully done, so you enjoy it.I guess what this film lacks is a simpler plot and the phenomenal pacing of the first film. Also missing is the magisterial presence of a certain Marlon Brando. It is easier to appreciate this film when you place it together with the first, as one single epic of the rise of one Mafia generation, followed by the decline of another. 
Slightly better than the original	10	Philippines	This companion piece of the godfather shows two parallel stories: the tale of Vito Corleones(brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro) simple life in New York and his subsequent rise as a head of a crime empire. the other story shows Michael Corleones(Al Pacino, in an Oscar worthy performance) succession as the new head of the Corleone family. In my opinion this is slightly better than the original, and more emotional, because it showed the transformation of Michaels once innocent mind into a full-fledged Mafia don who will stop at nothing to maintain his empire. This film also brought audience into a great example of irony: Vitos establishment of his empire with love and respect, and Michaels succession full of shattered morality and paranoia. Francis Ford Coppola made a sequel that surpasses the brilliance of the original, a modern classic, and Pacinos greatest performance to date. 
Almost as good as the original!!!	10	Bulgaria	And that is saying a lot.Probably the most fantastic and well made sequel of all time.Some consider it to be even slightly better than the original but for me the first Godfather is still the best mainly because of Marlon Brando.Despite of that The Godfather part 2 is a flawless movie,a timeless masterpiece with countless qualities that crabs the viewer and never ceases to impress.Al Pacino delivers simply a stunning performance and deserved an Oscar for best actor.Here he isnt the fragile,insecure young man he was in the original film.Here he is wiser and more respectful.Perfect Michael Corleone.The rest of the cast is amazing too.Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and John Cazale as Fredo shine once again.Cazale as the treacherous Fredo has a bigger role and makes an even greater impact on the audience.But a lot of the credit has to go to the brilliantly cast Robert De Niro who indeed deserved to win the Oscar for best supporting role.His portrayal of the young Vito Corleone and his rise to power is simply stunning.Excellent work.Director Francis Ford Coppola is simply one of the greatest directors not only of his time but of all times and shows once again that he is the biggest fan of the novel and shows great respect both towards Mario Puzo and his work. 
even better than part 1	10	Germany	The Godfather Part 2 is easily better than part 1 for several reasons.1. The telling of Con Coleones rise in power with Robert De Niro is very exciting and De Niro is amazing.2. The scene where Micheals brother Fredo is killed is the best scene in the film.3. I felt there was a bit more action but there was still time for story and character development.4. The last scene with Micheal sitting on the bench is also very good.5. The score is just as in Part 1 superb.So all in all Part 2 is better than Part 1 which didnt really believe could be possible. 
A great sequel and enduring vision of corruption and family.	10	Wolves, England	Without a doubt, Coppola made four of the best films of the 70s. The Godfaher Part 1, Part 2, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. Out of these, The Godfather Part 2 remains my favourite.It continues the Corleone family tale, of greed and corruption and yet Part 2 adds another vein to the bloodstream of this biblical tale; the story of Vito Corleone and his arrival in New York. The cinematographer, Gordon Willis creates a sepia-washed dream of a New York. Every shot is sumptuous ad full of depth - the production value was a help too, with some of the most authentic streets scenes ever committed to film.Though, as wonderful as the film looks, the acting is stellar to. De Niro completely transforms himself from the urban maniacs like Johnny from Mean Streets and Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, to form Vito Corleone, the younger Marlon Brando. De Niro doesnt over cook the character, instead he simmers; his eyes tell two tales, one of being content, the other of contempt, for the killing of his family.De Niro is backed up by great co-stars, such as Bruno Kirby who played the young Clemenza. The story itself in this section of the film is slow burning, much like the rest of the film, yet is here to serve a contrast to the story of Michael Corleone in Nevada.This is the part in the trilogy where Michael transforms from the college boy and war hero of part 1, into the heartless, muted confusion that he embodies here. Pacino plays the part with ease and never goes wild and shout, much like his later work (Glengarry Glen Ross, Godfather Part 3...). Keaton is superb as the WASP wife, Kay, who tries to break free of the corruption she has married into. Cazale, who plays Fredo is wonderful too, a helpless, jealous character, who forms one of the best brother characters in film history. The co-stars are also great, with Strasberg as Hyman Roth.Just as Michaels family is dissolving, Vitos is just beginning. The two fragments of the Corleone history run side by side to depict the downfall of Michaels character. Constantly trying to please his dead father, Michael talks of family, but doesnt understand how to sustain it.A classic. 
Not just a sequel, but another masterpiece of a continuing story.	10	United States	The Godfather Part II, is just as good as the first film. Al Pacino was absolutely awesome in this film. His performance in this film is one of my personal favorites, and probably one of his best performances of all time. This film was so good because it continues the story of Don Michael Corleone's rise to the top, and then slowly to the bottom at the end. Plus another cool thing about the movie, is that it has several flash backs on the life of younge Vito Corleone, played by Robert DeNiro (who also gave a great performance). Again the directing, and story telling, and the acting were great in this movie. It is truly the greatest sequel of all time. 
One of the best sequels ever made	8	Milwaukee, WI	 An excellent follow up to the original, The Godfather Part II continues where the first film left off and explores the rise of Vito Corleone in a series of flashbacks that, for the most part, correlate with what is presently happening to Michael Corleone (Pacino) his son and successor. This is a beautifully produced piece of film, and while I still prefer the first installment, simply because of the story content, it is every bit as good.  This film is best when watched together with the first film  if your body can stand it.  Even better, watch the third one as well for a little closure and so you can argue over whether it's a good film or not.  (I myself personally like the third film, but not as much as the first two.)--Shelly 
Poor Fredo! We still miss John Cazale!	10	United States	The Godfather Part II has excellent writing, plotting, editing is even brilliant, acting, and overall quality to watch over again and again. You can never get sick of watching this film. I miss John Cazale. He was truly a gifted actor and I miss him. He played my favorite Corleone brother. Sure Alfredo was never brilliant or vicious but he was sweet, gentle, and warm most of the time. He had a conscience and I despise Michael for killing his own brother. I think he killed him out of jealousy. Alfredo spent more time with Michael's son, Anthony, than he did and he resented him for it. Alfredo could have been spared. Four years after Godfather Part II, John Cazale died of cancer after filming the Deer Hunter. He never won an Oscar or made too many films but he made every role memorable. Rest in Peace, John. I miss you. 
The best sequel ever	10	India	There are bound to be comparisons to The Godfather,but it definitely comes close to surpass its predecessor but to no avail.But that doesnt take away any credit from another gem from Francis Ford Coppola.There would have definitely been immense pressure on Coppola to deliver the second time after the first one was a huge hit.Robert De Niro was outstanding as the young Don Vito Corleone and truly deserved his Oscar.John Cazale delivers on getting more screen space.But I was disappointed to see that Al Pacino as Michael Corleone after having overshadowed his previous work in the first and having reached greater heights in this one, did not get an Academy award.The film does not disappoint and matches the original in every aspect.Truly outstanding cinema. 
Michael, I Never Wanted This For You.	10	Cincinnati, OH, United States	Nino Rotas musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rotas music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone familys many criminal actions, we understand that one doesnt have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We dont look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vitos father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vitos older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vitos mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vitos hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vitos damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vitos sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, You once told me: In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. That was seven years ago. What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. Its like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michaels desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the films closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what couldve been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, It had nothing to do with business. The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once. 
The Godfather never forgets,nor he ever forgives.	10	India	If the Godfather is a masterpiece then this is a grand-masterpiece. How often do you see a work of perfection in movies? After watching this movie,you can (at least) answer once. The movie is the sequel and prequel to The Godfather as you all must know and shows the rise of Vito and Michael Corleone in two separate story lines. In this movie we see the rise of Vito Corleone to become The Godfather and how Michael Corleone expands his family business but we also see his moral degradation.In the Godfather we see Vito Corleone has no regrets for his deeds because he had maintained his virtues but in this movie Michael regrets his deeds very much because he has morally degraded(which we see at the end).This is a fair depiction of changing times. If you want to see a movie that leaves you with doubts about right and wrong ,justice and injustice ,hero and villain ;do watch this movie. 
This should be #1 in the top 250 here in IMDb.	10	Canada	The Godfather is basically the bridge that connects to stories in this movie.This movie takes you to the origins of Don Corleone and gave you an idea of how he rose to power and how respected he was in Sicily.While The Godfather is a work of art, this is a masterpiece.Everything you saw in the original movie plus more.A lot of character development, strong performances from all actors and great storytelling exist in this Dark Drama.Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and the rest are all excellent in their respected roles.With a movie this good, who knew the third one would not be as good as the first one at least? Highly recommended.My rating: 10/10 
The Continuing Saga Of The Corleones	10	Buffalo, New York	Although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of The Godfather: Part II. Many would argue it surpasses the original. With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years, Id hate to argue the difference.In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film. Id hate to think what would have happened in other hands. Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. And the best thing about The Godfather: Part II is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first.Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather: Part III, this film runs on two parallel tracks. The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties. Hes going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth, a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky. But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship.The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto. Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V. Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well, the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi. DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role.The woman do better in this film as in the original. Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi. You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino. Diane Keatons character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well. Shes a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that shes expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. Her scene with Pacino when she tells him shes leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers.Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. Hes the middle son whos passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather. Fredos big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down.Fredos got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out. He does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear. Cazale has some of the best moments in this film.If the first Godfather film doesnt do it, The Godfather: Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense. 
Considered by some	10	Italy	Critics to be better than the original artistically at least. I am still not sure myself but they may be right. It continues the legacy of the Corleone Family and digs into the roots of their criminal empire. There are a series of flashbacks and that could be confusing to some and to be honest I'm not sure that was positive for the flow of the picture but who am I to criticize that. There is more violence here than in the first Godfather and several scenes, like the original, feature real life events. I personally like the first one better probably because of Brando but I will watch both without reservation. Pacino shines here as brightly as in the first one and DeNiro gives it some much needed weight to replace or more accurately continue Brando's character. It is also much sadder than the first in my opinion and shows the misery and depravity of young Vito's life and why he was what he was. It is a true masterpiece. 
Sequel + Prequel = monumental film-making	10	Durham, NC	Francis Ford Coppola came perilously close in this film to accomplishing something rarely, if ever, done: he nearly made the second movie revolving around a particular set of characters and themes better than the first.In the truest sense of the word, Godfather II is NOT a sequel, nor was it intended to be. What Part II does is fill in details about Don Vito Corleone's arrival in America and rise to underworld power. That story was told by Mario Puzo in the novel, but involved too lengthy a story to include in the 1972 film. Coppola and Puzo did the next best thing: they told the prequel, the rise to power of Don Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and then appended to the prequel the story of the Corleone family subsequent to Michael's gangland triumph at the close of the first film. Appended should not be taken to have a pejorative connotation. There is certainly nothing slapdash about the tale of the Corleone family's fortunes following the obliteration of the rival gang leaders at the end of the first film.Al Pacino is stunningly believable as the still-reluctant Don Michael Corleone. He wants to move the family business toward legitimacy, but in the end events compel him to be strong for everyone by taking down all of the family's enemies, even when one of them is his older brother Fredo (John Cazale, again brilliant).Unlike the first film, Coppola does not pull off the same level of audience empathy for the Corleone family in the second film. Clearly the life of the crime boss is costing Michael everything while he gains all the power in the world. The first film is more equivocal on that point and also remarkably draws the viewer into a world where the Corleones can be viewed with some empathy. In Part II, Michael is far more cold-blooded and consequently a less sympathetic character. He seems less drawn into the vortex of organized crime by unexpected events, as was the case in the first film, and more the ruthless manipulator.This is really two great films in one. Vito Corleone's rise to power is portrayed with subtle intensity by DeNiro, always observant and always absorbing important information from his observations. Those scenes really capture remarkably the story of Don Vito's early years woven by Puzo in the novel. Wrapped around that prequel is a marvelous continuation of the original story with remarkable twists and turns and deft uses of historical circumstances (Congressional racketeering hearings and the Castro revolution in Cuba). This is another magnificent film, and fitting second step in the Godfather story.Don't end the story with the first Godfather movie. See them both. As for Godfather 3, well, if you really want to go ahead, but be prepared for a let down. 
The Godfather Part II	10	Marietta, OH	 I have to agree with Robert Towne when he said this film is one of the greatest achievements in the history of screenwriting. When the camera follows DeNiro as he moves from rooftop to rooftop, falling into the abyss filled with crime and corrpution, it will affect him and his family forever. DeNiro is slick and smooth as the young Vito Corleone. The rise of Michael Corleone's power is superbly captured by Coppola and delivered with cold hearted villainy by Al Pacino, in his finest performance. Strasberg is also solid in his performance of Hyman Roth. It's nice to see him put that method to work. The only one who feels out of it here is Duvall who seems to be simply going through motions. It may have been that Tom's character is also given limited depth within the script. It is a superb sequel, argued by many to be superior to the original. 
A rich epic based on great performances - a little too lush but still a great tale of the corrupting nature of power	8	United Kingdom	 Michael Corleone continues his rise within organised crime in 1950's America, by expanding his family's empire across hotels and casinos.  When an attempt on his life fails Michael proceeds with his dealings in Cuba with Hyman Roth, a deal that will not be as straightforward as it appears. Meanwhile we are told the story of a young Vito's move to American and his rise from the ghetto up into the world of organised crime.I don't know what I can actually add to the sheer weight of praise that has been heaped onto this film - it is as accomplished a film as everyone says and is rightly one of the few examples of a sequel improving and building on a film.  The plot follows two separate strands, the continuing rise of Michael that is as much detrimental to his family as it is beneficial to his pocket; the other thread being Vito's arrival in America as a child and his rise up within the Italian ghettos.  The two stories are not as intertwined as I had remembered - they are very separate and the film can go for quite a while before it switches over.  In a way this works better as it allows both stories to go ahead without fragmenting either too much.This film, as with many gangster films, has been accused of glamorising the life of crime and those involved in it, however, if anything Godfather II does this even less than the original did.  The film shows the moral collapse of Michael in the same way as the first showed his power.  In fairness it does contrast the rise of the two dons - showing how Vito manages to keep his family together.  Despite this I would still argue that Michael's path is far from glamorous.The two narratives are both excellent but for different reasons.  Vito's rise is very interesting and provides solid back story to the first film and we can clearly see the change in Vito from a quiet young man to the influential powerbroker that he became - we also sadly see the rise in his demons and his viciousness.  Meanwhile Michael's tread sees more powerful deals and double crosses as he continues to gain more power.  This was overly complicated for me the first time I saw it but, with reviewing it I have gotten more from it each time - more understanding and more enjoyment. The twin stories are both engaging and the three hour plus running time passes effortlessly - this is a saga and it never feels like the running time was anything more than what was necessary.The cast are fantastic.  Naturally the kudos go to the two leads, and they deserve it.  Pacino has a less showy role than in the first film as he has already done his falling - here we only see further proof of the corrupting nature of his power.  De Niro steals the film this time with a measured performance that parallels Michael's change in the first film - it is a performance that lacks a certain amount of personality but shows us the traits that the film is interested in.  As before the support cast are great, Duvall is reliable as ever, while the most improved role goes to Cazale, who's Fredo becomes more important to the story and almost becomes a biblical character.  Quality comes in waves with Shire, Strasberg, Spradlin, Kirby and many others with solid performances.  Keaton is good but she is not given as much time as I would have liked, even if her scenes are important and powerful.Overall this is a great film that is based on a classy pair of stories that bring the subtexts with them and a collection of characters that are well developed by a script and some great actors.  It may be a little too lavish and plush for my own personal tastes, but it is a rich story.  To a certain degree the production values and sheer class of this film could be accused of glamorisation, but generally those who say this have managed to totally miss the fact that this is a cautionary tale that shows the corruption of power. 
Nice Movie	10	Bangladesh	Robert De Niro became the only actor to win and Oscar for taking over another actors Oscar-winning performance. He was not, however, the first or last such actor to be nominated for this. Grard Depardieu was nominated for Best Actor in Cyrano DE Bergerac (1990), a role that had already won an Oscar for Jose Ferrer. Like Brando, Ferrer had played his role in English. Like DeNiro, Depardieu played the role in the characters native language; in this case French. Years later, Jeff Bridges would be nominated for his performance in True Grit (1969). John Wayne had won his only Oscar for his performance in the original film, which also featured Robert Duva. 
Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under sprawl	10	Indonesia	The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch- blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I cant remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the films importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see. 
Incredible doesnt even BEGIN to describe it	10	United States	The first sequel to win the Best Picture Oscar, and deservingly so, words cannot begin to describe how amazing this film is. Unlike the first (Ill admit, Im not the biggest fan of the first film) which had several slow spots, GFII had me riveted from beginning to end. Pacino and Cazale turn in the performance of their careers, while Francis Ford Coppola, who co- wrote this with Mario Puzo, directs with such precision. This film is truly a gift of cinema by all the talent involved. Everybody, even the smallest supporting actor, give terrific performances. The pace is fantastic. The writing is brilliant. The last scene at the lake...chills! Watch this masterpiece NOW!4/4 
understand	10	Japan	I rated this movie a 1 star not because it wasnt entertaining or wasnt cinematically compelling. I rated this movie one star because the message this movie delivers is ignorantly backwards. Throughout this film, we watch (in vivid detail) as Chris Kyle assassinates hundreds of Iraqi men, women, and even children in order to protect American troops. And yet, this movie ends a memorial. I understand that Chris Kyle did his job well. But that does not mean he should be honored as a hero. I love the United States. This is an amazing country. And so it bothers me when Hollywood portrays an American hero as someone who is willing to kill people without critically evaluating why they should be killed, who sees war as purely good versus evil, and who is hopelessly blind to the bigger picture. If there is ever to be peace in this world - heck, if we want to protect the US - we need to glorify people who are compassionate, who can put themselves in other peoples shoes, and who act in ways that promote trust and love - instead of fueling the cycle of anger and hate. Go see this movie. But please dont swallow it up without thinking first. 
Flawless masterpiece	10	Edinburgh, Scotland, UK	This is, for me, one of the greatest of all time. Any sequel to the original - again - one of the all time greatest - was always going to be tough. But to follow it with such a timeless masterpiece is nothing short of astonishing. The acting all round is utterly electrifying - from the big performers to the bit part players and extras. Each part is played to perfection. This is one of those rare movies that is totally complete. Words can barely do it justice. You could watch it a thousand different times and take a thousand different lessons from it. You could notice something each time that you hadnt spotted before. This is cold, unforgettable and absolutely absorbing. If you havent seen it before - go and watch it. If you have seen it before - go and re - watch it. Im not sure well ever see anything that matches its like again. 
Coppola Puts Himself In The Pantheon With Epic Part II Of The Saga	10	United Kingdom	Its hard to give an objective review when you are dealing with favourite movies. Having just watched this for the first time in years I was delighted to see it was as magnificent as I remembered it. Francis Ford Coppola would have been sensible to be wary of doing a sequel when hed just made a film as acclaimed as The Godfather. How do you follow that? Amazingly he managed to broaden the themes of the original, producing a study of power and corruption that may be unequalled in Hollywood history. And whereas some critics found the first film questionable in its moral compass (is Michael supposed to be a hero?) the sequel leaves us in no doubt that he has passed on into something else and as his wife Kay shrewdly notices, there is no coming back. Judge the film on its own merits and ignore the continuation of the saga in Part III. This is the final Michael as we should always remember him.The scope of Part II is extraordinary (as if the first film wasnt bold enough!) with the story of father Vito in 1920s New York cross- cut with son Michaels rivalry with ageing mobster Hymen Roth, a respected, though never trusted, business partner of his father. These later sequences may not make sense on first viewing but there are some remarkable set pieces from revolutionary Cuba to a Senate committee in Washington. This is a no holds barred portrait of American society corrupt and hypocritical from top to bottom. How often has Hollywood been so daringThe film invites a contrast between father and son, with young family man Vito embracing criminality out of necessity and using his status to become a Godfather in the Italian American community. Meanwhile in his middle age Michael has become a Don hooked on vengeance with all business now personal. The inevitable conclusion of which is a violent crescendo with him not just wiping out his enemies (again) but committing the far worse sin of betraying his own family. Few films can have gathered such a fine cast. Al Pacinos Michael is the symbol of idealism turned sour in extremis. More than anything this is what elevates The Godfather over so many other gangster films. Hes not just some Goodfella or ordinary guy, he once aspired to be a great man but somewhere something went wrong. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is the great constant across the two films, always at the side, never changing, but in his reaction to the transformation of Michael we get confirmation of his moral decline. Diane Keaton as Kay has a meatier role this time and as the voice of respectable America shows the futility of Michaels actions. If he cant keep his family together, whats it all for? John Cazales Fredo is a tragedy of his own. Secretly resentful of his younger brother, their mutual betrayal becomes one of the emotional cores of the saga. Replacing the character of Clemenza proved relatively easy as even if the story loses something, Michael V. Gazzo was memorable whilst the legendary Lee Strasborg is a suitably cast as rival/partner and pretend Uncle to Michael Hymen Roth, delivering one of the movies great speeches.So often artists seem burdened by great achievements, but not here. One can only assume that the young Coppola was so exulted by the critical and commercial phenomenon of The Godfather, he felt capable of anything and judging by this, he near enough was. One only wonders why hes largely struggled to reach similar heights ever since. 
Certainly the best movie	10	Norway	I love this movie for of the very interesting scenario. I also consider the actors playing, certainly amongst the best of their generation. Decors, costumes are also part of the reason I love it.The fact it is about European immigrants in the US, makes it also better for European to watch, without it being one 100% US culture movie. Also some points are true story, that makes it quite remarkable.Overall, I can say that this movie is truly violent, but not as per 2015 understanding. The violence can come in many ways. However, and despite this aspect, this is quite one remarkable movie which deserves to stay up and high in the IMDb ratings.The second part is maybe the best, but is actually really close from the first episode, which in my eyes is actually on the same level. 
Its about one mafia handing over control to the future mafia	10	None	This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.i copied bcoz i needed . 
KIng Coppolla hits a home run again!	9	United States	People say that The Godfather: Part II is one of the greatest hits in history.And I cannot disagree!It hits exactly what I was looking for in a Godfather sequel.It puts all the other godfather movies to shame,and hits all the marks from the previous movie spot on.The reason I gave it a 9 of 10 was because it went a over the line a couple times with some things, and is a tad bit lengthy but still enjoyable.Although it is not part of the book and just a long extension of it but still incredibly entertaining.I doubt the only other legitimate criticsm is that this movie is freaking awesome!It always keeps the ball rolling and never backtracks you,and always keeps you up and going with famous scenes and unforgettable one liners.This movie was a launching pad for many famous modern day actors to make their mark.For 1970 this was immensely un cheesy and one of my very favorite movies.I highly suggest watching this movie if you have 4 hours of your time to sit back and watch a masterpiece.I suggest to watch the first one just to catch up.I have never seen a better sequel since The Winter Soldier.The only way you cannot enjoy this movie if youre only in to modern day crap! 
The greatest sequel to date?!?!	10	United States	The Godfather debuted in 1972 to rave reviews, millions in box office receipts, and awards galore. Obviously, there was high demand for a sequel. So after great anticipation, could it be possible for Coppola to deliver?Everything great about the first film is equally great. The film follows two story lines, I believe this choice is perfect because it separates part II from the original, while showing the contrast between don Vito, and don Michael. Vito was in control, a family man, made compromises. Michael has no remorse, business is his first, and only priority.In my opinion the first and second godfather films are perfect. They are entertaining, but by perfect I am referring to the technical aspects of the films. Everything that filmmaking represents is in the forefront of the godfather and the godfather part II. On a side note, I dont understand this notion that the godfather films are the best films that nobody actually watches. I watch the first two at least twice a year. 
Better Than The Original? Maybe. Unbelievable Ride? HELL YEAH!!	10	Canada	The Godfather Part II is said by many to be the best sequel ever. I personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the Lord of the Rings sequels and the Empire Strikes Back. Say this is the best sequel ever and I will not disagree. Say this is better than the first and I will agree. Honestly, I keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time I watch them. This last time I watched them, the first one seemed better to me. The time before, this one was the superior picture. I dont care which is better, as long as I have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this.With the success of The Godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. The Godfather Part II acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by Coppola and Puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. When Pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with Serpico. His performance in this tops Serpico and everything else hes ever done. Unfortunately, he lost his sure Oscar win to Art Carney. Yes, Carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as Al Pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. The people at the Academy probably thought Pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. That would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in Scent of a Woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. At least the Academy got the Best Picture win right. That was a given. Pacinos rival/friend/co- star, Robert De Niro took home the win for Best Supporting Actor, beating out their acting teacher, Lee Strasberg. De Niro became the first Oscar winner to not say a word of English. I dont know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. Strasberg and Michael Gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table.The prequel follows a child Vito Corleone whos family is poor. He witnesses his family begin murdered by Corleones most powerful mob boss. He heads to America and grows up on the streets there too. Years later, an adult Vito (De Niro) rises to the top of New Yorks underworld and is determined to avenge his familys death. Revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. The sequel takes place a few years after the first with Michael (Pacino) as the Don. After he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by Hyman Roth (Strasberg), Michaels fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman. Both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. Al Pacino outdoes Marlon Brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. He leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. With most of this being arguably better than the first, Coppolas direction surpasses the first. The cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great. 
Not as good as the original, but still a great crime film	9	London, United Kingdom	My opinions on this movie are a bit mixed. The opening for the film was brilliant as it delves into the early life of Vito Corleone and then flash-forwards to the story of his son Michael Corleone following the events of The Godfather (1972). It was all interesting up until it started faltering during the lengthy middle portion of the film, when Michael travels around to various different places meeting different underworld figures. The pacing and editing was quite bad during the middle portion, so much so that I even found it somewhat boring to watch. It could have been better if Francis Ford Coppola was willing to trim some bits here and there during the middle portion. Nevertheless, the final portion of the film was back on track and largely made up for the weak middle portion. Like the original Godfather, the last 80 minutes of The Godfather Part II were very gripping and moving, with the ending probably being even more powerful than that of the original. The film had the potential to be just as good as, if not better than, the original Godfather if only if it wasnt for the overall inconsistency and the weak middle portion of the film.As for the performances, Al Pacino was again brilliant as Michael Corleone, while Robert De Niro was also very believable as a young Vito Corleone. The other cast members were also impressive, with some of the more minor characters from the first film, like John Cazale (as Fredo Corleone) and Diane Keaton (as Kay), getting more major roles this time around. Although I have criticized this film quite a bit, those criticisms are only relative to its predecessor, as The Godfather Part II is still quite easily among the greatest crime films of all time in its own right.9/10 
Your country aint your blood. Remember that	9	Australia	To call The Godfather: Part II (1974) a sequel doesnt quite do it justice. It is more of a companion piece to the original film, serving as both a prequel and a sequel, both expanding and enriching the characters and story presented in The Godfather (1972). This week I was fortunate enough to attend a cinema screening of the second film {each instalment of the trilogy played over three consecutive weeks}, and needless to say it was well worth the late night. When we last left Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), hed just been baptised into the world of organised crime. Now, years on, he must accept that his position of corrupt power can only lead to the disintegration of his family, and the loss of everybody hes ever cared about. Michaels plateau of despair, following the impressive rise we witnessed in The Godfather, is here juxtaposed with the historical ascent of his father Vito Corleone (now played by Robert De Niro) from a humble but traumatic childhood in Corleone, Sicily. The comparison delicately suggests the downside of the so-called American Dream in which Vito believes so passionately.As with The Godfather, Coppolas film could only have succeeded with interesting and authentic acting performances, and the cast doesnt disappoint. Al Pacino has rarely been better, playing Michael Corleone with a violent intensity that suggests the lasting influence of brother Sonny (James Cann), who was assassinated in the previous film. Pacinos scene with Diane Keaton, in which we learn that she received an abortion for her unborn son, is one of the most traumatic moments of spousal interaction Ive ever seen, with Pacino exhibiting a barely-suppressed rage through his severe, almost fearful, eyes, and a quiver in the jaw. An under-appreciated John Cazale brings depth and pathos to weaker brother Fredo, and Robert Duvall is excellent as Tom Hagen. New to the Godfather cast are Lee Strasberg (President of the Actors Studio) and Michael V. Gazzo, as business associates who may be plotting against the Corleone family. De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal of a younger Don Vito, understatedly evoking the essence of the character without parodying Marlon Brando.The Godfather: Part II is certainly an impressive achievement, but it doesnt quite manage to equal its predecessor. Whereas the original film achieved the bulk of its emotional power through the transformation of its central character, Part II leaves Michael hopelessly stranded in his despair, portraying neither his rise nor his downfall. Having effectively sold his soul for the family in the previous film, Michael must now come to terms with his desolation, alone in his misery, and having long forsaken any opportunity for salvation. He concludes the film still at the height of organised crime in America, and yet receives no reassurance from his position of power. Michael is alone, a dejected and self-loathing soul, without comfort from the family he helped destroy. Its a haunting ending that will remain with you for hours afterwards, but nevertheless doesnt seem like a conclusive ending to the entire Corleone saga. Fortunately, Coppola returned sixteen years later to direct The Godfather: Part III (1990), which charts, I believe, Michael Corleones inevitable downfall. Hopefully I wont be disappointed. 
the saga continues	9	United States	The first Godfather film was a beautifully rendered, violent and at times even warmhearted look inside a Mafia crime family. It deserved all the accolades it received for direction, cinematography, art direction and of course those wonderful performances by Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall and the rest of the cast. I think its fair to say no one expected the sequel to outshine the original, but to many peoples minds, somehow it did. It is even more intricate and expansive, presenting two stories at great length, one taking place before the first film and the other, continuing the firsts narrative. The Godfather Part II has been called both the greatest sequel of all time and the greatest American film, period. It was nominated for 11 Oscars. The sequel part of the film concerns Michael Corleones attempts to hold his family and its business together after the death of Vito Corleone. Times are changing and he sees an opportunity to invest in Havanas casinos with the help of Hyman Roth, a former associate of his fathers, and the pre-Castro, pro-business government in Cuba. The plot of Part II is difficult to follow at times; there are double-crosses, and perceived double-crosses that really arent, and its hard to know who is sincere about what. The only thing that is certain is that everyone looks after their own interests and there is no hesitation in using murder as a final negotiating tool. Killings and attempted killings continue, but in this film, they are more methodical and cold-blooded. Toward the end, Tom Hagen even asks Michael Corleone if he feels the need to kill everyone. No, Michael says, just our enemies. But when one of those enemies turns out to be his own brother, Fredo, it is clear that things have changed in the Corleone family, and not for the better. Francis Ford Coppola spoke of the inevitable decline in the Corleone family and it is very apparent, never more so than when Michael gives the order to have Fredo murdered. The prequel segments are, by contrast, very simple and tell the story of how Vito Corleone arrived in America and began to build his empire. Robert DeNiro does not so much replace Marlon Brando as offer an interpretation of Corleone as a young man. There is wonderful period detail in these scenes; the tenement neighborhoods of the recently arrived Italians, living in their own section of New York, bits of broken English beginning to find their way into the mother tongue. Its all filmed in sepia-tinted color, which creates the feeling of a time passed, like looking at old photographs. Unlike the 1950s plot, the turn-of-the-century story is fairly cut-and-dried. Vito Corleone marries, starts a family, and begins a loose partnership with other young immigrants in what will eventually become the Corleone crime family. He kills the neighborhood crime boss, the one who collected protection money from all the local businesses, and effectively replaces him and the old way, becoming a more benevolent, friendlier version of the Black Hand, if no less lethal when the need arises. He even finds time to travel back to Sicily and visit revenge on the aged crime lord there who had murdered members of his family. The Godfather Part II is filled with memorable performances, all of the continuing characters portrayed by the same actors as the first film. It is an epic undertaking and rewards repeated viewings with new detail unnoticed previously, not to mention better understanding of the labyrinth plot intrigues. It is also ultimately depressing, in a way the first movie wasnt. In spite of everything, the audience was pulling for the Corleone family to succeed and win out over its enemies in The Godfather; I dont think thats the case at the end of The Godfather Part II. 
A SO much better movie then its predecessor.	9	Sydney, Australia	The Godfather Part 2 was definitely one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is so much better than the first in the trilogy in every way, the effects, the acting, the dialogue, the setting and just everything. It is set over such a WIDE environment. It is a very long movie which might bore the young ones that like action-packed car chases/ explosions (which really p**ses me off) but it is an excellent movie for the REAL movie goers out there. Reasons it better than no.1: The special effects are way more up to scratch, the acting is so much better (it almost seems that all the actors from the previous outing have magically gained skills), and the structure is much more secure. It is a must-see movie that intelligent people will love. 
Masterclass Method acting	9	Amsterdam	With even the former director of the Actors Studio and proponent of method acting Lee Strasberg having one of the key roles this is one of the strongest acted movies ever. With Brando not present there seems to be more space for others. Especially De Niro impresses here because he had to take Brandos Godfather into account (he mimics his eye, head movement, diction and hand gestures). Both Strasberg and De Niro were nominated but De Niro won from the godfather of method acting.Part 2 is very well structured: Not only is it a great idea to integrate a prequel and a sequel but they enhance each other creating more emotional intensity: death and birth of a child for example. But the greatest achievement in structuring the story comes in the end, when several story lines are intertwining more and more until the short but powerful climax.Again we see that dark and light is used to separate the inner, godfather world from the outer, ordinary world. Only in the beginning there are more lighter scenes in the godfather world to signify Michaels failed efforts to go legitimate. Once again very effective use of doors, mirrors and windows just as in part 1.Where part 1 and the prequel are about the rise the sequel in part 2 is about the fall of the Godfather family (not the empire). Whereas Vito stands for traditional, Italian values, Michael stands for modern, New World-values. The core of the story comes in the end, showing Michael both in the prequel and the sequel as a lonely outsider. Thats why his efforts as a family man fail so dramatically, and hes in fact only excellent in business. 
Because the original just wasn't good enough		NY	 The Godfather: Part II is one of the best sequels ever made, because it's so unlike other sequels.  It not only tells the ongoing story of Michael Corleone, but it also tells the story of his father's rise to being the Godfather.  Al Pacino superbly reprises his role of Michael, and Robert De Niro is, in one word, perfect as Vito Corleone.  Imagine not only learning your lines, but learning them in Italian, and all the while trying to sound like Marlon Brando.  If you can't imagine any one else besides Brando as Don Vito, just check out De Niro's brilliant, Oscar-winning performance.  This is a must-see for any film fan, and especially any fan of the first Godfather.  I actually know people who prefer this sequel to the already fantastic original.  I can't say enough about this movie.  My one piece of advice is see The Godfather: Part II. 
Good film but not as good as the first	8	None	This is Coppolas epic tale of first generation Italian Americans making their way in the glamorous, criminal underworld of the 1920s and 1950s. The span is vast and ambitious. It cuts between the emerging criminal stronghold of Michael Corleone and the early life of his father, Vito Corleone.The unfolding narrative of Michael Corleones life, dynamics of the familial relations, and the way in which he legitimises his criminal infra-structures were well presented. It is possible to understand the protagonists moves and motives, his character has integrity in that regard.However, frequently and without warning, the flow ended in a crescendo of chaos. The material needed to be ordered and handled more sensitively. Good film but not as cleverly arranged as the first. 
A great classic	10	Romania	I enjoyed this movie tremendously. It gracefully blends two times: the fathers, who rises to power through his own forces, and the sons who takes care of his father legacy and increases his influence.Vito and Michael are to wonderful written characters, with both qualities and flaws. Also, the action is very captivating and i loved seeing Vito put the New Yorks scum in their place ;) and revenge his father! Michael is very intense and, just like his father, does everything for the good of the family. Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing and completes the first film perfectly. As Coppola wanted, they should have stopped here because the 3rd film isnt even close to the masterpieces the 1st and 2nd ones are. 
The Masterpiece Above All Others	10	None	What is there to be said about the sequel to what many consider to be the greatest film of all time? The Godfather: Part II is a film unlike any other. From the seedy casinos of Nevada, to the revolution in Cuba, The Godfather: Part II chronicles the reign of Michael Corleone, acted to perfection by Al Pacino, over a massive criminal empire. Corleones dealings with the manipulative and ruthless, but ailing, Hyman Roth, depicted by the masterful Lee Strasberg, are some of the best scenes captured on cinema. Roth is a weary, weathered old man, but he more than holds his own against the young, ambitious Michael Corleone. And how does one describe the character of Michael Corleone? Is he an evil killer that cares only about power, and will do anything to achieve it? Or is he a reluctant son, trying desperately to get out from under the enormous shadow of his father, but assailed on all fronts by enemies old and new? Perhaps both. The story of Michael Corleone in this film is a tragic one, without doubt. But his is not the only tale told in this masterpiece of cinema. The story of Vito Corleone, portrayed entirely in Sicilian by Robert De Niro, is interwoven with that of his son, and it is arguably as potent. A young Sicilian lad, orphaned by a violent Mafioso, Vito is smuggled off the island and to America. There, Vito is met with oppositions and struggles, and he overcomes them all to become the original Godfather. It is truly a journey, and shows the adversity that crafted a giant of a man.The Godfather: Part II beats the odds, and somehow, in my opinion, manages to be a greater film than its predecessor. It is a massive, complex, dark, tragic, ambitious film, and it succeeds in everything it does. 10/10 
The Best Sequel, Prequel, and Movie Ever Made	10	United States	Normally, movie sequels arent very good. They are usually just rushed cash-grabs to make money off of a successful property, but occasionally they can be just as good, if not better, than the original film, as rare as this is. (The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, Aliens, The Dark Knight, and Spider-Man 2 are examples of these.) Prequels are not so different, and are even harder to pull off. So, normally, the 1974 follow-up to Francis Ford Coppolas 1972 masterpiece The Godfather would have a lot to do in order to top the original. But, despite this, The Godfather Part II, is, in my opinion, not only better than the original, but also the best movie of all time. (I take back what I said in my review of the original about it being the best ever made, I hadnt seen this one yet.)The Godfather Part II is actually two films in one. Expertly presenting two story lines, one sequel and one prequel to the original, half of the film follows late-1950s Michael Corleone, now as the head of the Corleone crime family, expanding his power and picking off his enemies, becoming less and less like the man at the beginning of the previous film. The other half follows his father, Vito, in 1920s New York as he creates the empire that later gets passed down to Michael. Both stand out on their own, but the two story lines, brilliantly put together, create a masterpiece that is yet to be matched.Like the first movie, the best element of this movie is the acting. Al Pacino returns as Michael, in what is undoubtedly his best performance of the two films. (I cant say the best of his career, because these two are the only movies of his I have seen. Sorry, Scarface fans.) He is perfect as a man who, through gaining power, loses his humanity. If you have read my review for Lawrence of Arabia, youll remember I named some performances that would be on a list of the Top 10 Best Movie Performances. I have no doubts that Pacino in this film would be right on there.Before watching this, I had doubts as to how the movie would make do without screen legend Marlon Brando, as his character is twenty-five years younger, and so played by Robert De Niro. (I havent yet seen Taxi Driver or Raging Bull.) But after watching it, I feel that he is just as good, and he really deserved his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. He is so good that I cant decide who did a better job, him or Brando. Good thing he wasnt cast in the first film, otherwise the world wouldnt have this terrific performance.Although Pacino and De Niro are the highlights in this movies cast, the others are excellent as well. Robert Duvall as Michaels stepbrother, Tom Hagen, really sells his conflicted loyalty/fear of his changing stepbrother. Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, a man who Michael is trying to kill, is excellent. Diane Keaton as Kay, Michaels wife, really shows how she is frightened at what he has now become. And, of course, there is John Cazale as Michaels brother Fredo, the weakling who tries to be stronger than everyone says,but things dont go according to plan. (I wont go into specifics.)Just like the first film, another great aspect is the script. Doing one story line would be hard enough, but the fact that the movie does both so well, so flawlessly, is just amazing. It reintroduces the characters we already know, and take them to further places and develop them more, and also introduces more. It features parallels to the first movie, with similar scenes that show how things have changed. This installment also feels more epic than the first one, as things get bigger and darker.The film is also marvelous in its technical aspects as well. The score by Nino Rota, once again, is beautifully haunting, and even better than in the previous film. The cinematography by Gordon Willis continues to shine. (Even though, ironically, he himself has regretted some scenes that he felt were too dark.) The production design is fantastic, and it helps with the epic scope I mentioned previously. The violence is more realistic, and somewhat more graphic, which gives it a better impact. The editing is also good, as the two story lines are connected beautifully. If I have one problem with the movie, it is that it is slower than the previous film, as its longer by twenty-five minutes, and 3.3 hours makes for a pretty long movie. But, taking into account how brilliant the rest of the movie is, that can be forgiven.This film is so amazing, it astonishes on every level. I may have been disappointed that the first film only won three Oscars, but fortunately this one managed to get six, including a second Best Picture, which were all well deserved. (I have no idea how Pacino didnt get Best Actor, but, according to Some Like It Hot, Nobodys perfect.) Clearly topping the original, The Godfather Part II is the Best Film of All Time, so of course, I have to give it a 10/10 rating. 
The Greatest Film Ever Made	10	United States	The film opens, after a short shot of Don Michael Corleone getting his hand kissed, with a group of Sicilians dressed in all black walking through a hot desert to a mournful tune being played by a funeral band. Its a flashback, the first of many, that starts the story of young Vito Corleone. From his tragic reasons for escaping his native home of Sicily, to his rise as respected New York Mafia boss.Robert De Niros portrayal of Vito Corleone rivals Marlon Brandos. In the first film hes played by Brando with the utmost charisma, but we never know the reasons of how he became The Godfather. This superior sequel gives the reasons, and continues the expansion and decline of the Corleone family, circa 1959, in Nevada, and Cuba. The family is now headed by Michael Corleone, a man much more feared than respected, played by Al Pacino. Pacino plays the Don with lifeless eyes. Hes very quiet, save for his occasional outbursts brought on by the stress of his life. He is leading a life his father never intended for him. U.S. senators come to his home and express their distaste for Michaels heritage. His sister hates him. His immediate underling questions his decision to let certain people keep their lives. His wife is tired of this way of life. And of course, people try to kill him...in his home. In his bedroom where his wife sleeps. Where his children come and play with their toys. The attempt on his life prompts a military like approach to try and wipe out every enemy he has. But he has so many, and things dont always go according to plan. He takes pills for the headaches he gets, in plain view of his disapproving grim reaper like bodyguard. Its a dark film. Not only for the lighting of which Oscar winning cinematographer Gordon WIllis shot it in, but because nearly everything that happens in the movie is tragic. There is very little happiness within this film. But its plenty enjoyable. Part I is undeniably a masterpiece, but Part II adds so many things, most notably a group of amazing character actors. From that grim reaper like bodyguard I mentioned, whom by the way never says one word, to Oscar nominated Michael V. Gazzos boastful Frank Pentangeli, who says too much. Gazzo was just as deserved of that supporting actor Oscar as De Niro was, and the whole cast may as well have gotten one too.The more I watch this movie the more I love it, as any movie buff would. Theres so much to appreciate. The more you watch it, the more you see. Little things, subtle but so important. So many of them. Its in one word a masterpiece and in my opinion the greatest movie ever made. 
Not as captivating as The Godfather	6	Santa Monica, California	As far as sequels go this isnt awful. A lot of money went into this and the acting is excellent by everyone. The sparkle and grit and realism that appears in almost every frame of The Godfather just isnt here. Some of this seemed forced and contrived and overall the story is quite grim and depressing. Even in The Godfather there were a few scenes here and there that were light and slightly amusing. You get none of that here. Everything here is black.I also think that this a little bit too long. I think it could have moved faster. All in all it isnt something I would watch a second time. Not like the original, which is a product of its time. 
Need I say anything?	10	Berkshire, England	The Godfather: Part II (1974, Dir. Francis Ford Coppola) Its the 1920s and young Vito Corleone (De Niro) moves to New York to his life and new crime career, whilst in the future, his son Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) continues to further his fathers legacy.Francis Ford Coppola pulls off another epic classic which this time focuses on two different story lines. Al Pacino is just wonderful as always to watch, but Robert De Niro gets a mention for his amazing performance. The story remains at a steady pace and never goes off the tracks, making this a truly great film.I trust these men with my life, Senator. To ask them to leave would be an insult.  Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) 
A Second Offer Is Harder To Refuse	10	United States	Usually, a sequel is not as strong a film as the original. This one is every bit as good. I am thankful to have just viewed the Coppola 2007 restoration of this film.At well over 3 hours, it is longer than the original. What is does is deftly fill in 2 stories that we saw small parts of in the first film. We find out how the Don, Vito Cordleone got his name, what his real name is, and the history that made him who he was in the first film.The second story fills in more about his kids, particularly Michael, and how he took over in the late 1950s and his battles with one of his dads enemies. The back drop moves from Nevada to Sicily, and then to Havana. Michael faces down a series of folks including a Congressional Hearing about his life.While this has no Brando, it has an excellent cast from the first film with some additional folks added. James Caan makes a brief cameo at the end of the movie. Talia Shire & Diane Keaton head up to female cast though these films seems to have a cast of 100s because there are so many parties & events.The film keeps with the same strength as the first film, strong storytelling which brings you in and peeks your interest enough to keep you going. When you watch this, your always wondering what is going to happen next and who will get theirs. 
Best Sequel Ever	10	None	This, perhaps the greatest sequel ever, tells the parallel stories of Michaels struggles as the new Godfather and the rise of the legendary Vito Corleone. The presentation of Vitos story is particularly impressive, with DeNiro in a fine performance. Michaels story tends to bog down at times but never fails to be compelling. Pacino is terrific, as are Duvall, Cazale, and Strasberg. The cinematography is beautiful and Rota builds on his memorable score from the first film. Coppola pushes all the right buttons, letting the stories unfold majestically. Having made the two Godfather films by age 35, the talented director had nowhere to go but down. 
this is a masterpiece, the definition of the word movie	10	Ireland	this is something. if you thought The Godfather was special, brace yourselves, because The Godfather Part 2 is the greatest. Everything about this movie is perfect. the directing is brilliant. the way Coppola was able to weave two tales using only flashbacks was just groundbreaking. the acting, well it speaks for itself. De Niro won an Oscar for-this, and was richly deserved, but Pacino puts in the performance of his career, Duvall features much more and is marvelous. Cazale is picture perfect as the shaky Fredo. Bruno Kirby was my favourite as the straight talking Clemenza. All Im saying is that this movie can do now wrong. the simple message of this movie is that of a man who has a firm grip on his job. but is losing his grip on his life 
Very Impressive	10	United States	Maybe the greatest difficulty may have been to follow up a movie like The Godfather, possibly the greatest movie ever, and Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job, most pretty good originals have a poor sequel, but how do you make a sequel to an almost perfect original. Without Marlon Brando, Al Pacino fills the big shoes as the Don in this movie, along with Robert Duvall, and flashbacks to a young Vito played none other than by Robert De Niro. This movie shows the rise of Vito and how he became so powerful, and gives you background on his upbringing and family. It also shows you how much different times are and how Michael handles current situations. I read somewhere that they asked Marlon Brando to come back for the second even though he passed in the first he probably would have done some flashbacks and It upsets me that he didnt do that, but then again who knows how it would have turned out, If that happened maybe they wouldnt have cast De Niro and would never have had the career hes had. So i guess everything happens for a reason. The Godfather Pt II is a great film and falls so close to the original. 
No More a Sequel that the Odyssey is to the Iliad	10	United States	Its only a sequel because of the Part II thing. This simply fills in the spaces with one of the greatest characters of all time. Remember, the two were put together in an incredible sage, putting things in chronological order. Talk about your psychological studies. Inside the head of Michael Corleone is a sense of power at all costs. Yet, he sees himself as a moral man. I wonder if one could look at organized criminals like one might look at a mideast country, because they have their own principalities, their own history, almost their own religion. They have parceled out their land and protect against invaders. They fear and react to threats from the outside, from non-family members.The product they sell is terror. Of course, all participants live on the edge. Their human failings are dismissed and magnified as weakness and disloyalty. Brothers kill brothers. I havent a lot to add because I am not a film expert. As uncomfortable as this film makes me (like the first one), I continue to watch. And in my heart of hearts I wonder if I were cast into this setting, could I stand up to the expectations of my culture? 
More ambitious and grand in scope, Part II packs a powerful emotional punch	10	New Zealand	Given complete control over the directorial proceedings by Paramount, and a much larger budget to boot, you would be forgiven to think Francis Ford Coppola had it good when, two years after the release of The Godfather, the studio convinced him to direct The Godfather: Part II. Despite this free reign, Coppola still faced challenges  most important being the daunting task of matching the first picture, creatively and financially. There are many critics who regard the second part of the Corleone saga as not only equal, but superior than the first, and while I dont think Part II is as classic as its original, I can concede without hesitation that this is the more ambitious and grand in scope, and certainly more powerful as an exercise in tragedy.The Godfather: Part II continues the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), established in the end of part one as the new Don of the Corleone crime family, who has moved all their interests out to Nevada. Michael looks to expand his empire and invest in businesses in Havana and Miami, where Hyman Roth (one of his fathers aging ex-partners) resides. When betrayal comes from where he least expects, Michael must make decisions and sacrifices, however difficult, to save his family, and in doing so will perpetually change who he is as a person. Throughout Michaels ordeal, Coppola flashes back to the turn of the century, where a young Vito Corleone (then Vito Andolini) must flee Sicily when he becomes hunted by the local Mafioso at the age of only nine. As an immigrant, we are shown the rise of Vito (Robert De Niro from young adulthood onwards) as a man of respect, loyalty, enormous generosity and ever growing authority on the streets of New York.Coppola must be given due for the transitions between the two parallel story lines, which are absolutely seamless. They come at natural breaks so as to not take away from the pacing of either narrative, and the episodic approach to covering thirty-odd years in the young Vito storyline is perfect for keeping the audience on the edge of their seats for the developments in the Michael story. With the interconnectedness of the narrative, Coppola encourages a contrast of the way Michael and Vito take control of their respective families  what decisions they make, what they value  and this helps to further punctuate and underline the films harrowing final scenes.In keeping with the tone of the first picture, Part II sees the return of Gordon Willis dark, under lit photography, and Nino Rotas memorable, distinctive score (largely utilising the same cues as the first, with the addition of a few new themes including the magnificent The Immigrant). The acting across the board is quality  just as it was in the original. John Cazale has a larger role here as Fredo, whose outburst at being stepped over as the family Don is as forceful and potent as any in his regrettably short career. Newcomers to the picture give excellent supporting turns, Michael Gazzo as caporegime Frank Pentangeli and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone, preserving Brandos famous gesture and manner, but its Al Pacinos picture through and through  his Michael is so intense, but yet is an empty shadow of his former self. By the end of the picture, Pacinos beady black eyes are cold: completely stripped of life, and reflect upon the tragedy of the loss of the family he committed all his power to trying to protect. Its a haunting, powerful, parting frame that lasts. 
This is a sequel that demands respect!	10	Italy	After the huge success of The Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo go on with narrating the history of the Corleone family. It picks up right where we left it: Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has replaced his deceased father as head of the family, becoming one of the most powerful criminals in America. Soon enough, however, he will realize absolute power also means absolute solitude. Apart from his henchmen and his lawyer (Robert Duvall) he cant trust anyone (Keeps your friends close, but your enemies closer), including his own brother Fredo (John Cazale). Hell, even his wife (Diane Keaton) doesnt feel safe next to him anymore.As we witness Michaels dealings with power, corruption and murder, were also given the chance to see what gave birth to the Corleone dynasty in the first place. We learn, through flashbacks, that a boy named Vito Andolini had to escape from his native Sicily when his father was brutally assassinated. Once at Ellis Island, his home-town was mistaken for his surname. From that day on, he would be known as Vito Corleone. Yes, its the same Vito Corleone who made offers you cant refuse in the first movie, and this time were shown how he slowly became a feared gangster in his younger years. Its a riveting look at yesterdays society, which doesnt differ that much from ours: power is still as easy to obtain as it is to lose forever, and no matter how sophisticated mans methods can get, violence is still the best way to achieve something under specific circumstances.Just like Part I, this impeccable, superior sequel is masterfully staged by the filmmakers, their passion for the material breaking out of every single frame. The screenplay is flawless, Coppola and Puzo seamlessly moving back and forth in time to show us the origin and fate of the most beloved cinematic family thats ever shown up on a screen.The family theme emerges off-screen as well, as the directors father, Carmine Coppola, helps Nino Rota with the superb, tragic score.But lets not forget the extraordinary actors who made each member of the Corleones memorable: Pacino steals the show with his best performance alongside Scarfaces Tony Montana, while Duvall, Cazale and Talia Shire (not to mention James Caan in a priceless flashback cameo) display the same charisma they had in the previous installment. Yet theres one guy who tops all of them, the only one I havent mentioned so far: Robert De Niro, who won his first Oscar for playing the young Vito Corleone. Its one of those rare times people dont complain about the fact that a thespian was replaced in a sequel (okay, so Marlon Brando wouldnt have looked young enough for the part, but otherwise he would have been perfect): De Niros star-making turn has the power of not making you miss the older Don for the entire movie. Its a top notch performance based on gestures and looks rather than words (but then again, he only speaks Sicilian throughout the film), which would become De Niros trademark and which he proved to master perfectly long before Travis Bickle, Jake La Motta and Jimmy Conway made their appearance.Before The Godfather: Part II was released, all sequels were considered B-movies. I can see why opinions changed after this film: watch it back-to-back with its predecessor and youll feel rewarded for giving that awesome twosome part of your time. 
A rare sequel	10	United Kingdom	The Godfather part II is a fantastic sequel and a great follow up to the original. Most sequels are not as good as the original, some are plain rubbish. But The Godfather part II is rare because it is just as good as the original (some reviewers say it is better than the first but i don't think so). The performances are brilliant just like in the first. Robert de Niro plays a young Vito Corleone. showing the young life of Vito in the 1920's While Michael tries to extend the family business in the 1950's. The godfather part II is a must see for fans of the original,what a must buy for fans of the original. fans of the original will love 10/10 definitive crime film. Thanks for reading. 
For anyone who thinks the Godfather is overrated	10	United States	This post is probably gonna tick you off. But I don't want to flame on your tastes. I'm not gonna trash what anyone thinks is the best movie. This is just a very long-winded argument about why The Godfathers stand as milestones in cinema. Spoilers throughout.I've read a number of posts who think the characters are hollow. There are long scenes when the characters seems to be doing nothing, or just *thinking*. That's one of the great parts of the film. There are deep threads of loyalty and family and duty throughout the trilogy, and the original Godfather (and ptII) is one of the few films that does these moments justice. The cast assembled does what few ever have: you can see them thinking. Brando, Pacino, DeNiro, Strasberg (of course), Duvall - all masters of what is probably the most difficult talent to achieve on film. Pacino is especially great at this in GpartII when you watch him agonize over what to do with (if you've seen it) *you-know-who*. There is a subdued intensity to each character, living a life where death is always around the corner of one bad mistake. They're thoughtful, intelligent, and conflicted. The gift of these movies is they don't telegraph these undercurrents or make it painfully obvious. If you let yourself, the characters draw you in to these processes.Much of our current standards for cinema are based on flair and fast-action-packed-editing. Not to sound cheesy, but the Godfathers unfold like a rare flower, slow and with purpose. Keep in mind, there are no accidents in movies. That is to say, what you see in the frame is completely planned (as much as can be in cinema). Watch the scene where Brando is advising Pacino on the particulars of the business. There is real heartbreak between them, two men doing the family's business. Vito Corleone never wanted it to be Michael, and neither did Michael want it for himself, but both esteem the family more than themselves, and so they discuss this ugly business. If this movie were made today, the scene would only be a few snappy lines, some quick wit dialogue, and cut to the big explosion. This is a gem of a scene because you watch the actors put these emotions away to do what's brutal and necessary, and in a sense, say goodbye.Watch Brando in the car after the meeting with the Five Families. He comes to a chilling realization about who is behind the war, but how? Watch this scene and then re-watch the meeting with the Five Families for the moment this realization hits him. It happens and is gone in a second, but in that second you see him decide what to do. He tucks away his anger and waits. He waits until Michael takes over, and passes this knowledge on to him without ever telling him what to do. This is where the art of direction makes this possible. Without a word ever being spoken about what's coming, Michael takes over the family business and sets the table to take control over all the families. Of course, when the hits are actually being done, and splicing them into the scene where Michael's niece is being christened, is the best form of ironic cinematic poetry. What makes the GpartI and GpartII connection is you see the same process in DeNiro/Young Vito. After he's shaken down for the last time by Don Fanucci, he decides what and how to do it in a second - and DeNiro shows that, without a word ever being spoken. Of course, there are the iconic moments of the movie. The horsehead in the bed, (in the restaurant with Solozzo and McCluskey) Pacino coming to a boil as the train gets louder in the background, the opening scene with the undertaker (a great homily to Italian-Americans), Brando moving around the room and brushing his cheek, Fredo on the lake reciting the Hail Mary, Pacino kissing Fredo in Cuba, Sonny on the causeway, etc... These are just a few of examples of what make these movies great. I've read where people can't identify to the characters. How many of us really can identify with the people we see on film? The Godfathers paint a portrait of a life unknown to just about everybody. The real gangsters liked it so much, they emulated the fictional parts (like the hand-kissing). The films are poetry, but there's nothing poetic about the events in it. The characters are sublime, but there's nothing sublime about their character. The movies don't give anything away (who saw the Fredo thing coming?), but are transparent at the same time. I know this is high minded and stuffy, but hopefully, even if you're not a fan, you can understand why the films are so highly regarded.But, for the haters, I'll give you GpartIII - what in the h*ll was he thinking letting Sofia Coppola act? Part III is by far a weak addition to the trilogy...unless you're a die hard fan...not worth seeing. Now rub your eyes if you read the whole thing.... 
A cinematic epic by Coppola	10	Toronto	The Godfather II is not really a movie about the mafia. The themes that run throughout the film are of power,corruption of power and family. Coppola expertly tells the parallel stories of a father and his son with the use of flashbacks and flashforwards. He simultaneously shows how the father builds an empire and how his son subsequently unwittingly destroys it. The scenes involving the son Michael Corleone are very serious in nature,whereas the scenes involving the father,a young Vito Corleone, are presented in a more jovial manner.Before a flashback or flashforward, Coppola uses an effective technique of having children or the mention of children in the scene in order to emphasize the generational link through children. The flasback scenes are also photographed using different methods of lighting to contrast the different moods.Metaphorically, the story of the Corleones parallels the rise and subsequent corruption of America. The ultimate symbol of America in the form of the Statue of Liberty appears throughout the film. The assassination of Hyman Roth the Jewish Mafia chieftain, is eerily similar to the assassination of Lee Harvey Oswald the alleged assassin of President John Kennedy. Coppola effectively uses symbols such as the orange to represent evil. Several scenes show characters that do evil holding an orange (the fruit being a biblical symbol of evil).In an early scene Johnny Ola an emissary for Hyman Roth brings an orange to Michael Corleone from Miami. In a flashback scene, Don Fannucci (the black hand), is seen handling an orange before his demise. Michael Corleone is eating an orange as he plots the murder of his enemies. Coppola also uses catholic religious rituals as backdrops in major murder sequences. As Vito Corleone murders Don Fannucci there is a religious procession on the street. As Michael's brother Fredo is being murdered he is reciting the Hail Mary prayer. In the end Michael loses his soul and family to maintain his power. A great film by a talented director. 
One of the finest sequels ever made,Beats the Original...	10	United States	The Godfather is one of the best films of all time,it is a dark story and is brilliantly acted and told.It excelled in character development,directing,and acting.You'd kind of find it hard to believe that a sequel could be better,but Godfather II is the superior movie.Godfather II has the stories of the Rise of young Don Vito Corleone in the 1910's/1920's and the moral fall of his son Michael Corleone in the late 1950's.By the end of the original Godfather you thought Michael sank to the lowest he could be.Here he was a good hearted guy,he just returned from World War II,and he had plans to marry his girlfriend Kay,but through the film he declines into a monster worse than his father.Don Vito was an interesting character,he was no doubt evil,but you could tell he had a big heart.Coppola introduced a really great way to tell a story on film,you see Michael and Don Vito at the same ages in their lives,you see how the two Corleone generations differed,how one failed,and the other prevailed.Don Vito is played excellently by Robert DeNiro.This is definitely one of DeNiro's best performances.Don Vito speaks in Italian most of the film with subtitles,so DeNiro had to do a lot of work with his face,look,and posture.Its one thing to excel at giving lines,but DeNiro excels at both verbal acting and non-verbal acting.DeNiro's Vito isn't like the Brando one at all,he's quieter,and sadder,but really you don't want them to be clones all good prequels set-up their character to become the character they are in the sequel movie.The best acting of the film though has to be that of Al Pacino as Don Michael Corleone,he has changed for the worst between movies,in the first movie he ordered killings to get more business,in Part II he orders them to get even.His wife Kay who stood by him through out all of his evil deeds in the original is loosing faith that Michael is sane.Even Michael's good friend Tom Hagen(Played brilliantly again by Robert Duval) tells Michael he's won,and its over.Michael even gets to the point where he kills his own brother Fredo.Coppola makes Godfather II a lot darker than the original.The film feels more evil.Pacino gives arguably the finest performance of his career,his Michael is downright evil.Pacino has been able to create a character you know is dark,evil,and sinister.He's established a look for Michael.When Pacino's Michael has eyes of fire you know he's angry.For those who thought the original Godfather glamorized the mafia,you have to take a look at Godfather II,you cringe at what happens.Better than the original and arguably one of the best films ever made. (Personal Note)I don't really think a 3rd Godfather film was necessary,you didn't need to see Michael physically die,he was dead mentally by the end of II.A Very Very High 10/10 
amazing continuation, but personal preference remains with Part I	10	Manchester	SPOILERS If you were to stop people on the street nowadays and ask them to name their favourite series of films, they'll say either one thing. Either the person will believe the current hype and say The Lord Of The Rings, they'll recount to their youth and say Star Wars or they'll answer The Godfather trilogy. Containing some truly breathtaking acting and a jaw dropping good plot, the original Godfather film was a masterpiece. Even more surprising though is just how many people seem to prefer the sequel from two years later. Once more starring Al Pacino, Godfather Part II is an awesome film which could technically also be classified as a masterpiece. Still, despite the technical genius of the film, this second episode in the story of the Corleone family is slightly inferior to it's predecessor.In continuation from the first film, Michael Corleone (Pacino) is head of the family and living in Las Vegas. Apparently enjoying life, Michael is a much darker character than he was during the previous film. With plans to expand into foreign territories, Michael once more finds himself faced with difficult decisions and former friends turned enemies.The true genius of The Godfather Part II is the combination of sequel and prequel. Rotating between the early life of Vito Corleone (played in the original by Marlon Brando, but now played by Robert De Niro) and the current affairs of his son Michael, the film manages to tell two superb stories side by side.Pacino, as with the previous film, is once again stunning as the now cold and malicious Michael. Transformed from the outsider at the beginning of Part I, Michael has become a completely different person, and Pacino shows this with skill.In The Godfather: Part II however, the true star of the picture is Robert De Niro. Taking hold of the role of a younger Marlon Brando, De Niro spends his time on screen replicating Brando's mannerisms with apparent ease. He takes a firm hold on the life of the young Godfather, and he impresses throughout.Despite it's technical genius though, this second part in the story does feel slightly inferior to the original. To a degree this is possibly due to the Michael scenes being original rather than Mario Puzo's book, but the parts of the film dealing with Michael, never really seem to take off compared with the original. In the first film, we are shown a loving family who fight for each other and who come out on tops despite heavy casualties and strong opposition. In this second film, the view on the family feels much more dark and disturbing. Gone seem to be the family values, and instead Michael's direction seems much more obscure and unfocused.It's entirely possible that this reviewer simply didn't understand this film. There's no denying that upon first viewing the original, the impression wasn't good and it took a second viewing before becoming a fan. In comparison to the Brando and Pacino led first chapter however, this second chapter doesn't really hold water. This doesn't stop it being a masterpiece, and it is. It is easily one of the finest films ever made, BUT compared with it's predecessor, it doesn't quite work. 
Now, That's a Sequel	10	Ypsilanti, MI	 This movie accomplishes what very few sequels ever do, it rivals its predecessor in quality.  This film doesn't hit a wrong note at any point. All performances are excellent and there isn't any problem switching back and forth between the early 1900's and the mid 1900's.  It flowed so well. I can't argue with the top 3 rating given by IMDb users.  
Truly a masterpiece	10	London UK	 Often seen as possibly a greater film than even The Godfather this film is truly remarkable. Part of the film is a pre-quel, with Robert De Nero playing a young Marlon Brando (is that a dream casting or not?) partly it's the story of Michael Corleone as he grows into the role of Godfather. Again brilliantly filmed, great acting, a great story of love revenge etc. but in some ways it's harder to sympathise with Michael as he slips further into a hell of revenge and murder. Like watching a car-crash.  
A Good Sequel, but	8	Shibata, Japan	 I really enjoyed watching Part II, but I would not say it was as good or better than Part I. In Part I, there is the story of the descent of Michael into the family business. Part II is more like a good mafia story without much more. Only at the end, does Michael see the consequences of his choices but is so deeply trapped that he no longer cares. I liked the ending of the first story, leaving us only to imagine Michael's future. I was also much more confused by the Hyman conspiracy plot. On the plus side, I appreciated the flashbacks much more. It was a great insight into the man that was to become Don Corleone. I wonder how great the movie would have been if they merely expanded on that storyline. 
The greatest sequel ever made and equally as good as the original	10	None	It seems impossible to think that the first Godfather could be topped, but its direct sequel may be even better. It effectively takes all the elements from the first and makes them bigger and more complex, as well as revolutionising the idea of flashbacks. The plot is possibly the greatest of all time, the characters are more diversely fascinating and everything feels even more epic than before.The plot is split in two, one following the Corleone family in modern day and the other early life of Vito. The first follows Michael who is now Don as he attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas. He faces much dissatisfaction in his own family, from Capo Frank Pentangeli and his own sister. He later survives an assassination attempt, and as he tries to learn who made the attempt he also faces a committee investigation that tears his family apart. This story is one of the best in film history, everything about it is incredibly set-up. The second charts the young life of Vito Corleone as he raises his family in New York and aims to build his own legacy. This sees him challenge the local Don and gain friends to help him achieve his goal. This part gives us a true insight into how all of what were seeing started and is a fantastic mirror image to the modern events. The huge cast is once again truly outstanding. Al Pacino gives an incredible performance as we see Michael transform into a cold monster who has no feelings for his family. The way Pacino shows the struggle as he edges closer to the abyss is astonishing. The other star is John Cazale as Fredo, he is outstanding as the timid Fredo, the chemistry between himself and Pacino sets their scenes alight. Robert Duvall is solid as a rock once again as the reserved Tom, while Diane Keaton is great showing Kay as confused and frightened of her situation. Michael V. Gazzo is superb as Frank showing him as a genuinely troubled person. Richard Bright deserves praise as, despite few lines, he commands the screen as the loyal but brutal Al Neri. Joe Spinell is great as the doubtful Cicci as is Lee Strasberg as the devious Hyman Roth. Robert De Niro made his name here, he plays Vito with assured comfort and is just as good as Brando, which is praise itself. The film looks stunning. It is lit similar to the first and carries the same gloomily authentic feel being very atmospheric. The scenes of early New York and of Sicily are both excellent having a very natural look to them. The music from Nino Rota is once again marvellous. The script is full of classic lines, Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer and I dont want to kill everyone, just my enemies to name but two. Its great how the film focuses more on Michael and its reflected by the look at Vito. Michael grows increasingly paranoid and unstable as he places the family business above all else. We see the differences in how the family is set. Vitos was built on loyalty and love, whereas Michaels family is built on fear and violence. It is a fascinating contrast which the film itself is built on, the whole scope is formed from this showing the pleasant start of the family and then its tragic fall. There are so many classic scenes, Michael finding out the traitor, Kays pregnancy reveal, all of the conversations with Fredo, the scenes at the hearing and the famous fishing trip to name a few. The final shot of Michael sitting alone is one of the most memorable of all time.The Godfather Part II is a breath taking achievement in film and has possibly the greatest story ever put on screen. 
One  of the best sequels ever made	10	United Kingdom	I do have to agree that calling Godfather Part II a sequel is rather insulting. It is one of those rare sequels that almost outdoes the first, and considering how amazing the first Godfather was that says a lot. The Godfather Part II is longer, but in some ways it is also richer. People may say like with the first it is slow and takes a while to unfold. Of course, but I think that was deliberate. Both this and the first Godfather have an elegiac quality to them that makes them even more compelling.For one thing, the film is very well made. The cinematography is simply gorgeous, whether it is dark or autumnal or picturesque, and the settings are wondrous. The music once again is outstanding, it is haunting and sticks in your head for a very long time. Then there is a brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent and thoughtful, masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola and a fabulously constructed story. The film does have some wonderful scenes-: the scenes where Vito flees Sicily has the grandeur of a silent movie, while the scenes in Cuba actually avoid being clumsy and confusing and the climax is extremely chilling. Not to mention the Pop Goes the Weasel scene, which was very funny.The acting is superb once again. Vito is brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro in one of his better performances. I was also taken with Robert Duvall as loyal Tom, John Cazale and Diane Keaton. But the picture belongs to Al Pacino. He was great carrying the first Godfather movie, but he is even better here. He is simply phenomenal, and to be honest I think he should have won that Oscar. Overall, an amazing film and one of the best sequels ever to be conceived. 10/10 Bethany Cox 
more complex and even richer than the original	10	United States	Its rare for a sequel to match its predecessor, but the follow-up to Francis Ford Coppolas monumental mob family drama does more than simply continue the same story, expanding on themes only suggested in Part One to present an ambitious overview of organized crime in 20th century America. The Corleone family tree is divided here into parallel histories, with young Vito (Robert De Niro) arriving in the New World to begin a family, and a family empire, which a generation later his bitter and lonely son Michael (Al Pacino) would consolidate, destroying in the process everything he holds dear. The sudden displays of gangland violence are no longer placed in ironic juxtaposition to the unlikely richness of Corleone family values, being used instead to measure the corruption of il padrones immigrant idealism: murder to young Vito is strictly a matter of honor, but to Michael its only an extension of his absolute power. The crosscutting between two stories sacrifices a consistent narrative flow in favor of complexity and depth, but its a fair trade, and seen together with Part One (Part Two should not be seen without the introduction provided by the earlier film) is a rich experience not soon forgotten. 
I came here because theres going to be more bloodshed.	10	United States	Its difficult to imagine that Godfather II could trade punches with the original and still remain standing, but this is one brilliant film. Masterfully tracing the history of the Corleone Family from Vitos arrival at Ellis Island in 1901 to the Lake Tahoe empire of 1958, the story is a decades spanning saga that makes you wonder how almost three and a half hours can blow by so quickly. The pictures numerous flashback scenes work well to establish the beginnings of Don Corleones rise to power, and Robert de Niros portrayal of the young Vito effectively allow us to forget about asking why Marlon Brando didnt show up even once. Pacino is no longer the fresh faced kid home from the military who takes up the family business, but the brooding, brutal leader of a crime syndicate with a chessboard strategy of staying two and three steps ahead of his enemies at all times.If you havent seen the movie in a long time, you might be surprised like I was while watching today. Its easy to recall the highlights like Frank Pentangelis courtroom scene and subsequent suicide, and the way Fredo met his timely demise. What I had long forgotten was the way the picture opens with the Sicilian back story, and the way the New York neighborhood flashback thread literally runs throughout the entire picture. Its funny how I recall those scenes as a single sequence leading up to the murder of Don Fanucci, but it just goes to show you how faulty memory can be.You know, its hard to believe that the first two Godfather movies are nearing the forty year mark since their original release. Theyve become American classics that have well withstood the test of time, and will continue maintain their appeal. Its fair to say that seeing both of these iconic films are a must for the true cinema fan. 
Requiem for a Dream	10	Virginia, USA	You can write the volumes about the Godfather Part II phenomena. There is nothing that has not been said about it greatness, magnificence, perfection that radiate in every aspect, every moment, every inch of every frame, every performance, quote, glance, in the sound of the music, in both parts of the story, past and present that take the viewer to the journey in search of American Dream that turn to the epic vision of gaining ultimate power coming with ultimate loneliness. The story of one family of Italian Immigrants begins in Sicily in 1901, goes to New York Citys Little Italy and spans over the most part of the 20th century. The viewers and the critics often argue which film is better, the original Godfather (1972) or Part 2. (1974). Both films are perfect in every way, and the vision and movie-making talent of a young director named Francis Ford Coppola are simply awesome. His idea of making an American epic, the story of one family raise to power, the price it takes and the eventual fall instead of a low budget fast moving gangster movie as the MGM studio had planned proved to be the stroke of genius. It is not easy to choose the best of two but I prefer Part II because I found the way Coppola tells two parts of the story by intertwining them and cutting effortlessly, seamlessly between the different time periods and geographic locations - incomparable. Yes, its been done before and after him but never was I touched so deeply and amazed by the artistry and brilliancy of moving between past and future. I am surprised that the film was not rewarded for the editing because the team of editors contributed enormously in what is the magic of The Godfather, Part II. The film is unique by being at the same time a prequel and a sequel to the original Godfather because it tells the stories of young Vito Corleone first steps to the top of the criminal world and of Michael, his youngest son who became Godfather after his father passing. Part 2 has the most important scene in the whole trilogy, the scene when Vito kills Don Fanucci - the choice that would eventually lead to his raise as the crime family patriarch. I can go on forever. It is known how many great performances Al Pacino gave back in the 70s, his prime time (four Oscar nominations in the row, 1973-1976) but Michael Corleone in Part 2 is something that has to be studied and admired for as long as the young aspiring actors dream of not being stars but the ACTORS. I am not a fan of Pacinos latest films and roles. He screams a lot, he overplays but all screams cant say more than one glance from the scene during the New Year Celebration in Habana. He said so much by his eyes only that had literally darkened with disbelief, grief, anger, and despair when he realized that he had been betrayed by his own brother Fredo - who broke his heart and left the viewers heartbroken. John Casale had only given five performances during his tragically short career but every one of them was remarkable and every movie he worked in belongs to the best America has produced. ...Robert de Niro speaking only Italian as young Vito gives one of his finest performances speaking. He plays a beautiful, dignified, decent man, hard working, loving father and husband who would stop at nothing to make his family happy the best way he knows how... And above all - the melancholic, melodious, mournful score by Nino Rota, the Requiem for a dream, the best Rotas tunes outside Federico Fellini films, As great as it is, Godfather Part II would never be the same without musical themes written by Nino Rota specifically for the film, especially the main theme or the Kay theme - the sound of love lost and longing... And in the end - perhaps the best flash back scene ever filmed, Christmas and Vito Corleones birthday celebration - the family is close together, the grown up children sit around the table, talk about future, some choices have been made, but there is no alienation, betrayal, losses, regrets, death....yet. 
The movie that does everything right.	10	Groningen, The Netherlands	As far as sequels are concerned; they just dont get any better than this. As a matter of fact The Godfather: Part II even ranks above the sublime The Godfather, which got made 2 years earlier, starring mostly the same cast.The movie connects nicely with the first movie and decides to start off were the first movie had finished. Michael is the new Don now and he continues his father work by leading a crime syndicate based in New York. Besides the usual struggles with other the other families and other characters who are looking for opportunities to gain more power and control, Michael also needs to handle his personal life with his wife and his other family members, who arent all on the same line.But The Godfather: Part II is not just a movie that continues what the first movie had started. It also adds a story-line of the young Vito Corleone, played in the first movie by Marlon Brando. In this movie he is being portrayed by Robert De Niro, who wasnt really a big star yet at the time. Its amazing how these two different story-lines, set at completely different time periods and also in essence have really nothing to do with each other, blend in so perfectly. The historical settings of the New York of the early 20th century are also truly impressive.Its a movie that got practically made by the same cast and crew as the first successful movie. Of course there also are some new addition to the cast this time, in which the earlier mentioned Robert De Niro and Lee Strasberg impress the most. Both also received an Oscar nomination in the category for best supporting actor, along with Michael V. Gazzo but it was Robert De Niro who would eventually take the statue back home. What also makes this movie an even better one than its predecessor is the fact that this movie is filled with some classic moments of cinema. It contains some of the best known sequences and phrases. It also contains some great constructed and build-up sequences, for which the credit really needs to go to Francis Ford Coppola. Also the characters are more developed and expanded in this movie. A true accomplishment for a movie with so many characters in it but then again the movie has also more than 3 hours to tell its story.A sequel that even surpasses its brilliant predecessor.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/ 
Best sequel	10	India	Coppolas masterpiece is rivaled only by The Godfather, Part II in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power. The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacinos performance is quiet and solemn. He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film. Here hes a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies.The films haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niros rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacinos relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity.Coppolas motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, its a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor. It is not really a sequel, its just more. It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters. 
A truly stunning feat in film making	10	Ireland	In my opinion this is the finest of the crime genre ever made. It is thoroughly compelling from start to finish and the fastest three hours i can remember spending. Every aspect of the film is virtually flawless; plot, cinematography and in particular the acting. Pacino and De Niro are amazing in their respective roles and one can only look on in awe at the levels of believability in the characters that they attain. Although i would not consider De Niro's performance to be the greatest of his career as i think he achieved even more in his portrayals of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver and Jake La Motta in Raging Bull; for me this is Pacino at his best. The camera work in the flashback sequences chronicling the early life of Vito is stunning and would make you think you are looking at a picture from the twenties. There is obviously a lot of debate as to which is the better film, this or its predecessor, but i consider this to be superior as it holds the viewers attention more. An absolute Classic. 10/10 
One of the best sequels ever made	10	United States	The Godfather part 2 gets very close to the title for best sequel ever made, but not quite. Even so, I would rank this among the superior films to follow up on another and still be as strong and appealing and dramatically satisfying as the former. The structure of the film is also very important as it jumps back and forth between two stories of Corleones without any disconnected feelings for the audience. Both could work as perfect single films on their own; together its like a double album of the dark side of crime and the perilous nature of rising up in America as an immigrant. Its spectacular in many ways, masterpiece in fact, and has become as important as the first one (it is the only sequel to win an Oscar for best picture in those terms) and the acting all around is well-knit (even the pioneer himself Lee Strasberg is on hand as Roth), the score is possibly better in some ways to the first film, and most of the scene work is fantastic. One thing that attracted me to this film is also what I believe is one of the all-time great breakthrough performances in any film, as Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone has all of that confidence as an actor without channeling too much Brando. If there would be one reason to see the film and recommend it it would be because of him, as he gives one of his tour de force career turns in that streak of one after another in the 70s. Pacino is practically as good with enough lines that are realistically grounded but also highly quotable at times (the in my home bit is priceless). John Cazale, by the way, is also an element to make the film work as one of two performances that hell be remembered for twenty years down the line (the other being Dog Day Afternoon). In short, its just a very well done picture. 
Dull and Predictable	7	Albany, NY	 I hate being the lone voice of searing ridicule in a throng of glowing adulation, but I must say that I found the Godfather: Part II to be dull, predictable and pointless.  The Godfather is a wonderful film with a compelling story arch of a good American war hero being pulled into the depths of organized crime due to his loyalty to family. While Part II makes an attempt to elaborate and deepen this theme it does very little to bring anything new to it.  Michael's loss of his family and the fate of his brother Fredo is obvious by the end of the first reel. Such a predictable plot undermines what would otherwise be an interesting sequel to a great film. Only the flashback scenes with Robert DeNiro as a young Vito Corleone has any of the emotion and energy of the original Godfather.  If only the rest of the film was written and directed with such flair. I was so disappointed by The Godfather:  Part II that I haven't even bothered to see Part III and I have little interest in Coppola's other work to this day. 
Not being mean here but of the worst films I have ever scene.	6	United Kingdom	About six months ago I watched the Godfather Part I and to tell you the truth I thoroughly enjoyed, It had good cast, good story but still not worth number two on IMDbs top 250 and technically every top 100 film list on the web but still I must give it some credit. However today 15.7.12 I layed my eyes upon the masterpiece of terrible films I mean it truly is shockingly boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did. Robert De Niros role: My second favourite actor of all time after Jack Nicholson who does proud in practically ever film Ive seen with De Niro in until today. I mean what in Gods holy name did he win an Oscar for this pile of **beep** he wasnt even in half the film. Thoroughly disappointed, no wonder he didnt appear at the Academy Awards because he probably thought what the hell I am I doing winning an Oscar for the worlds most boring films ever. He probably felt embarrassed. How people and watch that film and actually enjoy it is beyond me. I dont think I am exaggerating either to be completely honest I only watched the film to the end to see if Michael Corleone died to boy was he getting on my nerves. I sorry if I have offended anyones opinion but if you want to sit and enjoy a film watch Pulp Fiction which by the way on paper if one worse that The Godfather Part II. 
Better than the first? I still can't decide.	10	Venice, CA	To those who say The Godfather glorifies the mob, I say watch both Part I and II in tandem. Observe where Michael Corleone begins and where he ends: he begins as the idealistic war hero, refusing to get involved in the family business, but he is quickly engulfed by circumstance and slowly transforms into a cold and ruthless underworld boss. The recurring theme of solitude is persistent throughout the film. Michael trusts nobody, and his instinct is ultimately proved correct when he learns Fredo has betrayed him. In the end, he is completely alone. He has destroyed his marriage, he has alienated his consiglierie, and he has murdered his brother. From this perspective, the story of the Godfather is a classic tragedy. The final shot solidifies this notion, showing Michael sitting alone, reflecting on his life. By trying to protect his family, Michael has destroyed it. 
If A Greek Philosopher Directed A Gangster Movie . . .	10	Collingswood, NJ USA	I secretly read Mario Puzos The Godfather in 1974 when I was 12 after my mother prohibited me from seeing the movie. She was trying to shield me from the rough language and lurid violence. There sure was a lot of both but more so there were great characters. Vivid, real, flesh and blood souls that acted on well drawn impulses and ambitions. Consequences were openly inevitable but somehow jarring, devastating and poignant. Historical elements were stunningly precise yet grandly broad and vast. I was entirely, absolutely overwhelmed by the visceral sensations and sprawling imagery. So this is what literature is all about. This is what reading, I now understood, could be. I had been something of a sci-fi junkie previously, but from then on I was a converted disciple of the Great American Fable. The story was truly great and I never could have imagined a better one until I finally saw the movies.Astoundingly, Francis Ford Coppolas film adaptations surpass the novel in a few key details. The casting of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is the single greatest improvement on the original story. Where in the novel, Michael is something of a strapping, virile, obviously competent man of action, Coppola introduces a crucial element of doubt by way of Pacinos diminutive stature. Though we are told Michael is a returning war hero, we are skeptical of his leadership abilities, especially in the company of such physically imposing figures as his father and oldest brother Sonny. Pacinos bodily disadvantage works to emphasize the complexities of his reluctance to join in the Family Enterprise, and makes his cerebral and emotional challenges that much more epic.The other notable improvement on the book, of course is Marlon Brando, who created one of the most indelible characters for the big screen. There wasnt then, nor is there now, any other person in the industry who could so monumentally fulfill the herculean task with which that character is charged. Don Vito Corleones function in the story is metaphorical, transcendent, mythological. He is the living embodiment of the ageless value of Heritage. Heritage which only endures through the tenuous bonds of family unity, but transported to a young, naive, unsympathetic land, is now being severely tested. But since Godfather II begins after the Don is dead it is faced with the considerable challenge of how to maintain this crucial historical perspective. So, Gf 2 immediately whisks us back into time with a vignette of Vitos tragic childhood in turn-of-the-century Sicily. Later begins a series of flashbacks to his early manhood in New York City played by a sublimely low key Robert DeNiro. Oddly, he is not engaged in acts of wanton destruction, sociological delinquency or self indulgent pride. Rather, we are casually informed of Vitos entry into the underworld by way of seemingly reasonable acts. He is drawn as a man not just doing what is necessary to survive in the rough, often brutal New World, but driven by his familial responsibilities and a sense of duty to his community. The period from which we are flashing is the late 1950s and early 1960s. By butting the old up against the new we are offered a sparkling view of the clash of cultures, of just how much had changed in those few decades. This dichotomy introduces a two fold historical perspective. By way of the contrasts between early and mid century life we are being informed of our present day (1972 and after) cultural afflictions. Its a subtle, almost invisible point, but one that is, I believe, extremely profound, the central theme of the story, and even more relevant today. Consider how, just one single decade after the time when the story ends to when the films were made, American life had so radically changed. Now consider how much things have changed since then.While most fans of the film are impressed with the robust characters, compelling dialog and and terrific action produced with expert cinematic skill, I was even more fascinated by the films more abstract qualities. Coppola, much more so than Puzo, is playing Socrates here, posing a dialectic query - How is it that primal cultural tenets might survive in a climate of overwhelming opposition? Francis is troubled, alarmed by the assault on vital culture that all humanity is experiencing today, and obviously very cynical that cherished and valuable, essential traditions can persist. This cynicism was a pervasive theme at the close of the sixties and it infused nearly all the great art of the time. Remember, the year of the books publication, 1969, also saw the release of Easy Rider. Not insignificantly, that too was a story of social outsiders, antiheroes colliding with an increasingly corrupt, immoral majority. This cynicism is the intellectual, psychological and emotional driving force of the The Godfather I  II, and its the thing that kept me coming back to them, again and again. So, what for many is simply a superb, if not the greatest, Gangster Movie, is for me one of the finest critical views of the American Way. It is, in fact, irrelevant that the Corleones are mobsters, because ultimately what destroyed them is what is destroying all Americans. The disintegration of the essential commitment to family and community - our succumbing to all the temptations that undermine our strengths - is our downfall. Its no coincidence that the tragedy ultimately concludes in Las Vegas, the spiritual center of Americas true religion, the Capitol City of Temptation. Our cultural decline has progressed to where it is now terminally incurable. Great art in the service of a dying society. We have all become Fredo.
