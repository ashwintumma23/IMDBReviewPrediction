The fact that aspiring actors, directors, and writers can&#39;t find work while this crap is produced is absolutely appalling.	United States	*Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldn&#39;t be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.<br><br>Well, to explain the depth of this &#39;film&#39;, I could write my shortest review, ever. Don&#39;t see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I&#39;ll go on for a bit.<br><br>I don&#39;t know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn&#39;t matter. They&#39;re all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it&#39;s film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films &quot;get away with it&quot;, I&#39;ll give Disaster Movie a pass here).<br><br>The &#39;jokes&#39; are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (there&#39;s some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).<br><br>You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I don&#39;t care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization. 
Not Humorous...in the least bit	United States	I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this &quot;film&quot;. How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;, should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being &quot;Twister&quot;. How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn&#39;t say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.<br><br>There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I can&#39;t believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. It&#39;s an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.<br><br>Rating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour &quot;Manos: The Hands of Fate&quot; marathon than watch this slop. 
There&#39;s just no point anymore	Canada	Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, I&#39;m just going to be making a few observations and points I&#39;ve deduced.<br><br>There&#39;s just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.<br><br>I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there&#39;s going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, &quot;THIS IS SPARTA!&quot; and, &quot;IM RICK JAMES BITCH&quot; so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.<br><br>Don&#39;t see this movie. Don&#39;t spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and then silently judge the people that are talking about this movie on Monday. Do yourself a favor. 
The irony is very correct.	Canada	Since the name of the movie is &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;. The basic irony is that it&#39;s a ****ING DISASTER! A 90 minute **** flick based on pop culture and movie trailers. My god, Seltzer, retire and live off the money you made from your other below 3 star rated pieces of horse ****, please. Now when you do these type of movies, you&#39;re never going to get the &quot;jokes&quot; in 5 years, maybe even 2. They&#39;re just wasting their time, not really. They&#39;re just wasting our time. But whoever goes and sees this are brainless (Hypocrite moment) but bare with me, I got in for free and I regret it.<br><br>A free ticket, and a bad nightmare.<br><br>Do not watch this, support other films that are coming out today whom deserve it more.<br><br>Come on, do you REALLY want more of these? **** guys, just ****. 
Awful, pure stupidity	United States	This movie I saw a day early for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. It is totally brain dead. Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.<br><br>Anyone see &quot;Idiocracy&quot;? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. &quot;Date Movie&quot; was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes &quot;spoofs&quot; (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; and &quot;Superhero Movie&quot; all falling flat.<br><br>Well I&#39;ve wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, don&#39;t see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.<br><br>Thanks, R 
Wait... What?	United States	Honestly, what is wrong with you, Hollywood? Not only is this the WORST thing that has happened to you ---- you keep funding these &quot;cheesy writers of Scary Movie&quot; to make these movies. I mean, come on Carmen Electra, you know even better than them that you have potential! Stop portraying in parody movies! <br><br>See, I can&#39;t believe I am comparing &quot;parody&quot; to this movie. This movie has no &quot;parody&quot; or &quot;comedy&quot; in it, this is all referencing. All they need to do is see a movie title, take a line and a scene from a trailer, and turn it into a script. Never in my LIFE have I ever been so ticked off by you (Hollywood).<br><br>I mean, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, you don&#39;t even care for the money, you just want to prove you can be a film-maker too, but that&#39;s not the point! Movies are something you should enjoy, and this... this is making bland jokes and pointless (as I may say &quot;comedy) with fart jokes and people being hit with objects... or just getting hurt (but you realize that they are okay)?<br><br>Now please, STOP! You&#39;re ruining the name of &quot;parody&quot; and you are causing people to hate you even more!<br><br>Please, as a warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS. 
Someone please put an end to Seltzer&#39;s awful career	Cold Spring, KY	I was given a free ticket to this film; so I can&#39;t complain that I was ripped off (except in that some 90 minutes of my life were irretrievably stolen from me). These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) haven&#39;t been funny for some time now but &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; has reached a new low. There wasn&#39;t one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged &quot;jokes&quot; were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it. 
Disastrous	Upstate New York	OK, so &quot;Disastrous&quot; isn&#39;t an imaginative barb for this movie, but then there&#39;s not a shred of wit to the movie, so....<br><br>I saw this movie for free. A friend who said he &quot;pissed his pants&quot; at the trailer had free passes. I think he&#39;s incontinent.<br><br>A spoof of disaster movies might have been fun. This is not it. A couple disaster movies get referenced, not really spoofed. Instead, the &quot;spoofing&quot; is of recent movies of all genres, and of aspects of current pop-culture. Then again, how current is women&#39;s wrestling or the &quot;Head On&quot; commercials?<br><br>If there&#39;s anything about it that&#39;s good, there&#39;s the 70 minute or so running time (where did they get 90 minutes?) and Nicole Parker seems like she might be good, if she had good material. 
Never EVER make a bet with your friends	United States	If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I&#39;ll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.<br><br>Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I&#39;ve been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.<br><br>The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).<br><br>I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my &quot;friends&quot; and that wasn&#39;t a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well I&#39;m warning you at least. It shouldn&#39;t even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..I&#39;m sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).<br><br>Oh and please, the random wrestling scene? I don&#39;t know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldn&#39;t have something in a movie that doesn&#39;t add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you would&#39;ve gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps I&#39;m grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.<br><br>But lastly (well I&#39;ve got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.<br><br>I give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies, or mediocre for that matter. 
My Eyes!!!!	United States	It&#39;s hard to imagine anyone writing a &#39;spoof&#39; movie even worse than Meet the Spartans, but Seltzer and Friedberg have pulled it off. It&#39;s not even just a little worse. It makes Spartans look like Raiders of the Lost Ark in comparison. You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out.<br><br>May Contain Spoilers....if you care: First off, as it appeared in the trailer, this movie does not spoof, or really even reference disaster movies at all. The set shakes a few times, there are some plastic asteroids, and a bad cgi tornado, all of which that do nothing to add anything to the movie, but other than this there&#39;s nothing even relating this to said style of film. Instead we get references (not to be confused with actual spoofs) to such films as High School Musical, Step Up, this summer&#39;s crop of comic based films, Enchanted, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Kung Fu Panda, and Sex and the City. I can&#39;t wait to hear Seltzer and Friedberg praise their own genius and describe this movie as being modeled around Cloverfield...they clearly tried to do this, but other than the outline of the small group of people running through the city trying to find the injured girlfriend, there&#39;s nothing relating this piece of crap to the monster movie.<br><br>I can honestly say I did not laugh once at this movie. All of the &quot;jokes&quot; were forced, and many of them were dragged on for several minutes at a time...the two writers clearly thinking they were onto some kind of comedy gold here. Probably the most insulting thing about this movie is, like all their other gems: Epic, Date, Spartans, they consider the audience to be mentally challenged...having to tell us point blank what movie it is they are referencing (again...not spoofing) Such lines like: &quot;It&#39;s an inconvenient truth, it&#39;s global warming,&quot; &quot;Come here you kung fu panda,&quot; &quot;what is this enchanted place,&quot; &quot;How do you know all this? I know because I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,&quot; &quot;Let me get my Get Smart phone (proceeds to talk on his shoe),&quot; and &quot;whats with the marching band? I thought I&#39;d cheer you up with a high school musical&quot; all exist to make sure we&#39;re in on their super intelligent antics.<br><br>Please, save your money for anything else. Show Hollywood that they need to stop these two guys from making any more movies. I can&#39;t even imagine a 5 year old finding this stuff funny. Speaking of 5 years old, that&#39;s about how long many of these jokes will last before absolutely no one can find them funny anymore since, as usual, most of them are simply based on pop culture references. 
An honest comment from someone who has actually seen the movie	Chicago, Illinois	Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the way everyone talks about these guys are as if they are on America&#x27;s Most Wanted List, boy there is a lot of hate before the release date of Disaster Movie. They have brought us the &#x22;stupid&#x22; comedies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, pretty much all those movies have had the same hate, I can understand why. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C&#x27;s and D&#x27;s, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it&#x27;s the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie, didn&#x27;t mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy&#x27;s previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you&#x27;ll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.<br><br>Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.<br><br>Disaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. There are just some fun moments, I think it&#x27;s ridicules that some people can not admit that. That&#x27;s the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn&#x27;t even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining... this isn&#x27;t the IMDb that I know, it&#x27;s silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie, my main thing that I&#x27;m upset with, this movie didn&#x27;t need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.<br><br>1/10 
Worst. Movie. Ever.	United States	First things first: disregard the rating above because they don&#39;t allow for rating low enough for this movie. I would honestly say 0 for real numbers although negative would be more appropriate since I left the theater feeling worse than when i entered.<br><br>Next, I have to preface this by saying I only watched the first half of the movie. I&#39;ll also add that I have never walked out of a movie theater and i would have walked out far earlier if I were by myself. Luckily i saw it for free so those idiots who made it will get no profit from me.<br><br>I presume that this movie is meant to be a comedy yet in 45 minutes i did not even chuckle at the movie. I laughed at my friend&#39;s face because it matched my own: &quot;Why are we subjecting ourselves to this?&quot; Crude humor can be funny, idiotic humor can be funny. Somehow Disaster Movie takes these kinds of humor to a lower level than I have ever seen. I have seen nearly all the other movies of this variety and they had some remote humor, this had none.<br><br>I do not think hallucinogenic drugs could have salvaged this movie experience.<br><br>I felt like someone should make a TV infomercial warning against these movies. Like the ones that tell kids not to smoke or say &quot;If you have mesothelioma you are entitled to monetary compensation, call this number for details.&quot; <br><br>If I had possessed the materials I would have made a shirt to warn people constantly about this.<br><br>Please do not see this movie. Although if you know someone you need to get back at tell them to see this.

A Movie That Made Me Cry	United States	I normally don&#39;t cry in movies. Forrest Gump, Big Fish, Schindler&#39;s List, and many others have passed before my eyes, and not a tear has been shed. I consider myself a lover of cinema, with an appreciation for the art of film. I love many genres, including comedy, action, and of course, zombie movies. All of this aside, I watched &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; this afternoon, and it elicited one emotion from me: Anger.<br><br>I have never been so irritated in all of my adult life by a movie. I have watched these cretins put out all of this filth that masquerades as &quot;entertainment&quot;, and have held my tongue until now. I will say this right now: anyone who finds these movies entertaining should be ashamed of themselves. I generally believe that people can have whatever opinion they want, but people that actually like these movies are contributing to the downfall of the art form of cinema. By encouraging LionsGate to continue making these horrendous movies, all we are doing is perpetrating a cultural crime that we may never be able to fix. I grow weary of the multitudes who flock to theaters to see this garbage, and I weep for the future of our nation if this is what passes for entertainment these days.<br><br>None of the jokes are funny. The parodies of films like &quot;Juno&quot; and &quot;10,000 BC&quot; fail to amuse, and even the lampooning of unexplainable culture phenomena like Hannah Montana and Amy Winehouse is an exercise in futility. No one has ever tried to do more with fecal matter and farm animals than this movie did, and it failed miserably.<br><br>I beg all of you, as a lover of movies, not to see this film. It is an absolute atrocity, and I guarantee you will feel stupider for having watched it.<br><br>PS: I work at a theater, so the only reason I even saw this movie was for job purposes. I didn&#39;t pay to see it, and neither should you. 
Someone please kill Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer	Ontario, Canada	If nobody does, I will. After the critically panned Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, these two assholes decide to make another. It&#39;s the same formula, they make fun of popular movies in a tired, unfunny fashion.<br><br>I saw it with a few friends, hoping maybe I could get maybe one or two laughs out of it (I didn&#39;t expect anything). When I came out, I was seriously stunned at how lame the movie was. One friend actually liked it, all I had to say was, &quot;What have you been smoking lately?&quot;.<br><br>I&#39;m not even going to bother explaining the plot, since there really isn&#39;t a plot at all. All I can say is, don&#39;t waste your money watching the film. It contains no genuinely funny humor and is one of the worst movies ever made. And everyone thought Meet the Spartans bad, wait until they get a load of this one. 
100% Disaster !!	Qatar	Why i went to the midnight showing of this movie i don&#39;t know but i guess its better then buying a ticket to this movie. Honestly i cant say i have ever seen a movie as bad as this in my entire life. This movie makes gigli look like an OK movie. There isn&#39;t one funny moment in the entire movie it is basically all crappy acting mixed with crappy comedy. The only way you could possibly find this funny is if you are high or have an IQ lower then 30. Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectra&#39;s acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it. I mean you would be way better off watching KIm&#39;s sex tape cause at least its more entertaining then this movie. I highly advise everyone to not see this movie ever and try to get these to directors to never make another god awful movie again. Its kind of sad 2 grown men find this funny. PATHETIC 
Don&#39;t even bother...	Canada	I just finished viewing Disaster movie on opening night. I came in with no expectations at all due to being tired of these spoof movies since Meet the Spartans, but I had to go in since I couldn&#39;t see Death Race. So when I was viewing this movie I really thought nothing could make me laugh. There were no character developments, there were no disaster movies spoofs(the only disaster things happening in the movie were meteors falling which were only 2 by the way). To tell you all the truth, I only chuckled once or twice(at the Juno parts). The rest of the jokes were either dumb, immature, or just recycled garbage from past movies.<br><br>So to tell you all right now I have to say one thing about this movie: Don&#39;t see it, it&#39;s no improvement from previous spoof mistakes.<br><br>Rating: 1 out of 10 
Who the hell says teens watch this?	United States	I wish this thing has a lower rating than one, this horrible excuse for a movie, deserves it over and over again. First off, these movies are NOT fueled by dumb teenagers foolish enough to watch them. I&#39;m 15 and even I know this is the biggest garbage ever. I don&#39;t watch these movies since Date Movie, because I learned right there that these movies suck. I went to a it with a friend and basically went to see how much it would suck. It sucked major ass. I walked out after a half-hour and hassled for my money back. When was the last time there even WAS a disaster movie? Juno, 10,000 B.C., Don&#39;t Mess With the Zohan, Indiana Jones, these are completely irrelevant, as are the hundreds of unfunny jokes ripped off the comedies they spoof (which is stupid as it is to spoof a comedy) and made them even less funny.<br><br>Because of this movie, I will probably never watch MadTV again because it ruined my opinion of many of them. They give pathetic, poorly performed excuses for &quot;acting&quot;, and showed how horrendously unfunny they can be. (It&#39;s worse than when Tina Fey left SNL).<br><br>If you want comedy, don&#39;t watch this, spoofing is an art, a talent few posses, and these two jack-weeds don&#39;t posses it AT ALL. If you want to see good comedy, go to the store and buy Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane!, Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, Scary Movie 3, and Superhero movie, because those movies are actually hilarious. Some less than others, but SM3 and SHM are far better than 10 Disaster Movies.<br><br>So anyone who says that dumb adolescent teens fuel this garbage, think again because this stuff is garbage and I don&#39;t watch garbage. (this was an exception because people like my friend fuel this garbage :P.) This films will give you AIDS, makes you lose your hair, make you go blind, become flacid, makes you get a purple sock, this movie will destroy you and your sense of humor. Excuse the graphic descriptions, that&#39;s what it does to you, on the inside. DON&#39;T WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IF YOU DON&#39;T WATCH THIS, THOSE DUMBASSES WON&#39;T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS GARBAGE. THINK OF YOUR FUTURES! WHAT IF 80 MORE OF THESE FILMS ARE MADE WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AROUND. THINK OF YOUR CHILDREN, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON&#39;T SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! 
Not worth the admission	United States	Went to see it with a friend at the spur of the moment. I haven&#39;t seen the other movies of this kind besides the first two Scary Movies. We ended up being the two oldest people in the theater (21 and 22). While the masses of preteens behind us laughed hysterically at the minute long belch session, I was exchanging horrified glances with my friend. It was pretty terrible. If you took a bunch of 6th graders together and told them to put together a skit in about 5 minutes, it would probably look something like Disaster Movie. The only moment we laughed was the chipmunk scene. Seeing them head-banging just seemed hilarious at the time, maybe because everything else leading up to it had been so mind-numbingly terrible. It&#39;s not worth the price of admission. The was one good thing about the movie though. The night felt so anti-climactic after that film, that we decided to go to Atlantic City and had a blast. 
Oh my god, this does not look at all good.	United Kingdom	Now, this is review is just based off of the trailer, but still. I saw the trailer when I went to see get smart. Which I liked. But anyway from the same lame brained idiots who brought Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans comes Disaster Movie. What&#39;s wrong with this movie? For a spoof film to have no satirical content and just have footage of superheroes flying into walls and various other stupidity. And what the hell is up with the Juno and sex in the city bit? That is without a doubt the weirdest bit in movie history do you really think the woman who wrote Juno is going to see her characters baby kick a woman in the face and go, oh I got burned. Also what&#39;s with the bikini girls running away from meteors? That&#39;s just kind of sexist.<br><br>The plot is ridiculously thin it&#39;s just people avoiding meteors. There&#39;s less plot than in Pee Wees adventure where he just loses a bike. Aaron Selzter and Jason Freidberg had better stop making movies because they are just wanting money. 
Brings a new meaning to Disaster Movie	Mexico	READ THIS BEFORE YOU CONSIDER WATCHING &quot;DISASTER MOVIE&quot;: DON&#39;T. JUST DON&#39;T.<br><br>Since I don&#39;t live in USA, there is absolutely no possibility for me to run across Friedberg or Seltzer. Because if I ever did, I will throw them whatever heavy object I have at my grasp right to their faces.<br><br>Believe me when I say this. There is no way this piece of garbage (sorry for the comparison, garbage) can have any shred of wit, creativity or thought.<br><br>Do not honor it with your attendance at a theater where it is actually shown (even if you get a free admission).<br><br>Why, do you ask? What does this &quot;movie&quot; have that can be so bad? Well, it has everything and nothing at the same time. It has all the references (not parodies) of every single movie you have paid good money to see lately. Not just that, they try to make fun of &quot;Juno&quot;, a movie whose script by Diablo Cody is light years ahead of Selter and Friedberg&#39;s, and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, a movie that redeems the famed franchise. Schumacher made a genius portrayal of the Dark Cruzader compared to what said idiots have done. &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; was better than this. The whole &quot;nuke the fridge&quot; scene was smarter than any scene in &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t have any real craftsmanship whatsoever. The only likeliness this thing had to film-making or production was the basic presence of a camera and people in front of it (not necessarily actors). The jokes? That&#39;s the joke: There are no jokes. More and more references to celebrities and big movies. And the main thing &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; is missing in the &quot;plot&quot; is... you guessed it! A disaster! <br><br>I personally thought &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; was going to be the end of this &quot;Spoof Movie&quot; era. But they made &quot;Superhero Movie&quot;, and now, Seltzer and Friedberg are back! Ahhh! The humanity! <br><br>An advice to producers outside the &quot;Spoof Movie&quot; circle. If you want your movie to become a success, mention that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had nothing to do with it. You&#39;ll make millions (the only ones who won&#39;t see it are pre-teens that have never seen any real movie, and paid to see &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Epic&quot;, &quot;Spartans&quot; and &quot;Disaster&quot;). <br><br>I wouldn&#39;t say you should avoid it like the plague, because the plague is funnier, more enjoyable and has a better thought script than &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;. It doesn&#39;t even deserve to be voted upon. 
I cant believe Im saying this, but this is even worse than Meet the Spartans	Long Beach, California	The writing of this movie is truly inventive. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have figured out how to make movies with no plots, based on movies they have only seen the trailers to, and these movies have such low budgets, that they still make money. Even with the low budget, they have an all star cast, full of bad Madtv actors, Carmen Electra and even the legendary Tony Cox. The acting, writing and direction all sparkle like the latrines of a diarrhea filled bathroom. This movie might be on par with Schindler&#x27;s List for the amount of laughs, or there lack of. Honestly, though, this movie is one of the most god awful things ever made. Even their last all time low Meet the Spartans was topped in terms of horrible writing and direction, and the current rating of a 1.3 shows that Mr. Friedberg, Mr. Seltzer and their other writing partner Satan can&#x27;t get much worse.<br><br>Disaster Movie...what a title for this, considering not one Disaster Movie is spoofed. Every movie here is one that came out within the last year, many which came out after this piece of garbage was written, and not one of them was a disaster movie. I guess they did a parody of Twister with the cow falling, but being the geniuses these two gems of writers are, they probably haven&#x27;t seen Twister and just thought it would be funny to have a cow crush Iron Man. I was practically wetting my pants with some of this material. The Hulk&#x27;s pants fall off, then he&#x27;s hit by a cow. Duh, haha, duh, that&#x27;s some good stuff. I think the target audience of this movie must be two year old mentally unstable children, and even they would find the humor a bit too dumb and immature.<br><br>Onto the plot of this winner. Will (Matt Lanter) has a dream that he&#x27;s in 10,001 B.C. and he fights the Wolf from American Galdiators and meets Amy Winehouse who burps for like ten minutes on him, then gives him the Crystal Skull. He wakes up to find his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) is leaving him for Flava Flave and little man Jojo. He throws a super duper sweet sixteen, despite that he is 25, and then a High School Musical number goes on, and then Calvin (played by the wonderful G. Thang) tries to curve a bullet, then Carmen Electra gets in a battle with other beauty Kimberly Kardashian, then Junie sings, and then later Javier Bardem, Prince Caspian, Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf and a police officer are all played by Ike Barinholtz, and thousands of sub-plots and movie spoofs of every recent movie comes in.<br><br>I must admit, I laughed more here than in Meet the Spartans. Meet the Spartans produced about .5 chuckles, where this in total produced maybe 1 chuckle out of stupidity. The laughs were obviously infrequent, considering there was only 1 in this 75 minute collage of badly reproduced movies. The acting is actually not too bad in comparison to Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie, but the overall enjoyment level of none was reduced to less than none. It&#x27;s sad movies like this could be made (let alone be called movies). This was the most awful putrid flick to ever appear on the big screen, and as long as it makes money, each year we will be treated to even worse movies from these swell writers and directors.<br><br>Overall, this was not the best movie around, in fact, it was the worst. Avoid this at all costs. If it was a choice between this movie and death, it would be a tough choice.<br><br>My rating: BOMB out of ****. 75 mins. PG-13 for stupid humor and poopoo mouth. 
This movie actually made me angry...	Bay Area, California	Angry, in as so much as that I wasted my money, my time, and my intelligence. I could actually feel my brain cells die off while watching this atrocity. I would say that no one over the age of 11 should be let into this &quot;movie&quot;, but that would be an insult to 11 year olds. Don&#39;t bother to read for a synopsis, given that you would first need a plot in order to have a synopsis. Indeed, I think I have already put more thought and effort into writing this comment than those who wrote the movie put into the script; that&#39;s assuming there even WAS a script.<br><br>I would give 0 stars, but I can only choose 1 as the lowest. Save your money... save your time... save YOURSELVES!!! Avoid this movie at all costs, and boycott anything else put out by these shameful &quot;creators.&quot; 
Completely Horrible	United States	I went to the movies yesterday to see a movie. Unfortunately the movie I wanted to see wasn&#39;t showing. My ride had already left, so I figured that I should watch another. There weren&#39;t that many available so I saw Disaster Movie.<br><br>This movie is the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. It got to the point were I got a huge headache and completely mind numbed. I wanted to leave almost 5 times during the movies. The actors were horrible. I could play better roles handicapped and blind.<br><br>This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I recommend you don&#39;t watch this movie at all. You&#39;d be happier in the dark corner of your room by yourself while depressing music plays in the background. 
Its been several months, and my review was inevitable...here goes...	United States	Jason Friedberg &#x26; Aaron Seltzer.<br><br>I&#x27;m generally a defender of the mainstream, but these two....these two....<br><br>They embody all that&#x27;s wrong with Hollywood, hell, with modern film in general. <br><br>I hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films, they aren&#x27;t satirizing films THEY ARE REFERENCING films, they are not a mockery of crappy Hollywood excess, they are an EXAMPLE of it. It&#x27;s like if Michael Bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive CGI and explosions. To do a parody or satire, you must PROVIDE or Impersonate examples of your topic and MOCK them over specific flaws and contradictions, you don&#x27;t COPY them and change things by adding hip-hop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. It&#x27;s clear they haven&#x27;t even watched the films that are &#x27;parodied&#x27; here, in fact, several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting, thus making effective parodies of those films impossible, and imagine for a moment if &#x27;Hancock&#x27; or &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; were never made and they still included references to those films, would you still consider that &#x27;hip&#x27; and &#x27;relevant&#x27;?.<br><br>And even IF, pray tell, these films were funny, they are still off-topic. 99% of all the &#x27;jokes&#x27; have nothing to do with Disaster Movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. FACT: You cannot parody something effectively if you don&#x27;t even mention it. Cut out the off-topic scenes from &#x27;Disaster Movie&#x27; for example, and you&#x27;ll only be left with 3, maybe 5 at the most, minutes of film, mostly credits. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s the funniest film in the world, if it doesn&#x27;t in some way deliver what it promises, I&#x27;m still not even gonna give it one star. If the titles were meant to be symbolic or something(like how &#x27;Dancing with Wolves&#x27; isn&#x27;t literally about dancing with wolves and Chris Ware&#x27;s &#x27;Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth&#x27; comic is about an adult with autism), it wouldn&#x27;t matter, but in this case, they specifically say what they are going to do, and then disappoint. And sure a lot of comedies have off-topic jokes, but NOT ONES THAT TAKE UP 98.9% OF THE WHOLE FILM! At least &#x27;Bio-Dome&#x27; actually took place in a Bio-Dome!<br><br>So I apologize if you get off on being disappointed, sorry, but I&#x27;m not. I prefer to laugh when watching a comedy, or at least, have fun. <br><br>And even worse, when they DO make actual parodies of something, they only do lame, obvious, predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively, if not more so. Oh, so Hannah Montanna&#x27;s a merchandising whore, WOW I didn&#x27;t know that!!! It&#x27;s like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parent&#x27;s are discussing politics by making political jokes, but who knows nothing about how politics work, so he just say&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;m a politician&#x27; and makes fart noises with his mouth. Is that cutting-edge and insightful satire? NO. But these idiots seem to think it is, because it&#x27;s basically what they do, only with &#x27;actors&#x27; doing it for them. My review for &#x27;Caltiki&#x27; is a better example of satire. And don&#x27;t call me a snob, because I&#x27;m a guy who loves stupid comedy, &#x27;Jingle all the Way&#x27; and &#x27;The Stupids&#x27; are some of my favorite guilty pleasures, hell, I started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because I dared question the audacity of &#x27;Mystery Science Theatre 3000&#x27; and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks &#x27;South Park&#x27; is a sign of the coming Apocalypse.<br><br>So don&#x27;t blame other people&#x27;s films, these are crap all on their own.<br><br>And if they intend their films to be that way, that just makes it even worse, so they intend to make off-topic, unfunny, parody-devoid, boring, unpleasant films? That just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. Even assassination attempts. And if they really do consider their films to be real parodies, then they are one-trick ponies, and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few tricks,(like the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars, or Dane Cook being juvenile and unoriginal, although yeah, he is) then these two are the one trick-iest one trick ponies who ever lived, and their only trick is being off-topic.<br><br>These films aren&#x27;t even entertaining in a so bad it&#x27;s good way, in fact, they are the antithesis of entertainment. I usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film, as I used to think that that was impossible and although I&#x27;ve done so, it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired, drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. Well, it&#x27;s true, these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. In fact, if someone could have filmed me &#x27;watching&#x27; this garbage, I&#x27;m sure there would have been Z&#x27;s floating over my head.<br><br>Ditch this crap, please.<br><br>Oh, and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this, I&#x27;ll let you know I didn&#x27;t pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film. <br><br>~ The previous review will suffice for your Freidberg-Seltzer film of choice~ 
This Is Not The Worst Movie Of 2008. This Is The Worst Movie Ever.	United States	&quot;Disaster Movie&quot; is the 4th movie that has been made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Like &quot;Date Movie&quot;, &quot;Epic Movie&quot;, and &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot;, this spoofs many blockbuster movies and pop culture figures of recent years. This time, the focus is on the &quot;disaster&quot; theme similar to &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;.<br><br>Since 2006, Jason and Aaron, who first met while working on &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, usually release one movie every year. This is actually the second movie they released this year.This is actually the second movie they released this year. At the beginning of this year in January, they did &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot;, which opened at #1 and spoofed the entire script of &quot;300&quot;. I saw that film and thought that it was going to be the worst movie of the year.<br><br>After seeing this one, I can say &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; is quite possibly the worst movie ever. I mean, it really is the worst movie ever made and released. You can put it straight to DVD or Blu-ray, and it still wouldn&#39;t be funny. You can air it as a made-for-TV movie, and it still wouldn&#39;t be funny. You can make it into a TV show pilot, and it still wouldn&#39;t get picked up. You can even get &quot;MAD TV&quot; canceled by including this as one of their skits.<br><br>What throws the whole movie is that the jokes are continuous every 4 seconds and never have any humor. Every time you think they will forget something, they end up spoofing it. They actually try to spoof every movie made this year. And they even try to include every TV character and celebrity in their jokes. It just doesn&#39;t amuse, and it just doesn&#39;t quit. They really have no idea of when to quit.<br><br>But the real reason why the jokes aren&#39;t funny is that it&#39;s inaccurate, overused, and butchered poorly. They spoof &quot;High School Musical&quot; with the main characters, and they poorly spoof Gabriella as a cheerleader, which she never was. They spoof &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot;, an animated movie, using a robot panda that looks like a panda in the real world. The performance they did with &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot; will give you so many nightmares, you would rather the 2007 version over this movie. The idea to use a male actor to play Carrie Bradshaw in the &quot;Sex &amp; The City&quot; spoof is too desperate, too obvious, and worst of all, so wrong. And the other jokes used have been used already in their other movies, used already in other spoof movies, and are too old to even try and would have been used at the appropriate time.<br><br>This movie doesn&#39;t even spoof disaster films in general, unless if you can find any real &quot;Cloverfield&quot; spoofs. Some of the spoofs aren&#39;t actually in the movie and rather used as promotional ads. All they try to do is give many films and A-list Hollywood stars the roasting they &quot;deserve&quot;. In reality, they destroy the &quot;parody film&quot; genre again and with more damage that a lot of people would rather stop making fun of them in movies like this. Normally, you can actually expect a film parody to be declared the worst movie ever by many people. But I guarantee that there is not and will not ever be a movie as worse as this one. 
Well, at least it lived up to its name, Disastrous Movie or is it Disaster Movie, whichever one fits.	United States	This year Jason and Aaron pull out another &quot;movie&quot; from their repertoire of steamy crap, and I quoted movie because this thing is barely a movie. When I think of a movie I think of something that has a plot and characters, but this is some kind of unknown piece of work. A razzie won&#39;t do this film justice. But at least the razzie people now know who to give the award to. So bad it almost makes the other ones seem good.<br><br>PROS:I have nothing good to say about this film. Absolutely nothing. <br><br>CONS: my favorite part of this comment. The cons. OK first of all Aaron and Jason need to look up the definition of spoof in the dictionary, the definition might vary from a dictionary to another, but I am pretty sure no dictionary will give the following definition, a piece of work in which various objects fall on pop culture icons and random stuff with no synchronized manner happens. If a dictionary gives that definition to the word spoof then i stand corrected. For me parody movies are taking a little amount of a pop culture reference and expanding upon it and making original jokes such as airplane and scary movie and all those other movies which Aaron and Jason should have learned from. In this film, however, the genre diverts from a parody to wackness.<br><br>99% of the jokes in this movie are prolonged and at some point you feel like you are being tortured. And then the unbearable redundancy. As if the audience like the jokes they already made in the film, they make other ones in the same manner. Where one of three things happens, something falling on someone, or somebody being hit brutally and somehow make it through, or somebody starting a random dance-off. The scene I hated the most, not that I liked any, is the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin and the chipmunks show up, and for some reason start chewing on Juno&#39;s character(named Juney). The scene was somewhat disturbing and rubbish. everything in this film is a rip off. 95% of the characters are ripped off. the jokes are all rip-offs and it almost looked like an unscripted reality show, you know, where people do random stuff cause it&#39;s not scripted.<br><br>FINAL THOUGHTS: The saddest part is that these guys are making a living like this, I mean come on, there are talented actors and directors out there who are dying for roles and these guys are making a living by writing a script that looked like it took two hours or less to complete? unbelievable.<br><br>Another thing, What is wrong with us human beings these days? I mean some people were actually laughing hysterically during the film, and I thought of the film Idiocracy, where people find this kind of stuff funny. <br><br>I look forward to hating the next movie they are going to bring. I really do. 
Abysmal	United States	It was...I mean...I just don&#39;t know what I can say. Anyone with a soul knows this &quot;thing&quot; is worthless.<br><br>If you like things you know getting hit by other things you may or may not know. Popular culture references that are often not even that timely. And production quality that is on par with community college theater. If all of that stuff is what makes a movie good for you, still, STILL, don&#39;t watch this. Because it fails at failure.<br><br>And a word to people who are into bad movie self-punishment. Just rent Troll 2, no one but the renter makes any money. And it doesn&#39;t give a false positive that someone watched this on purpose. 
Oversaturated and corny.	United States	It seems that this type of movie died after the Wayans brothers stopped making the Scary Movies. Those movies were funny and didn&#39;t try to squash 20 movies in that didn&#39;t fit or relate. Scary Movie 1 was about Scream and Scary movie 2 was about House on Hunted Hill. These other movies could have been good if done right but these ( Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Superhero Movie, and Disaster Movie ) were poorly executed, lazy, poorly written, and off topic.<br><br>Distaster Movie could have been good if base off and idea in the genre like Twister,Cloverfield, or Day After Tomarrow. Also if it actually had funny and talented actors and writers.<br><br>This movie only had one moment that made me laugh out loud just because I wasn&#39;t expecting it. That one moment was very brief as it was followed by Chucky Cheese like animatronic Chipmunks that ruined my one moment of joy in this cluster f of pop culture regurgitation that had no business being in the movie.<br><br>I can&#39;t believe I paid to see this crap! After the movie I felt embarrassed and cheated. 
A real disaster	United States	This movie was a real disaster. I can&#39;t remember the last time I&#39;ve been so disappointed to point of wanting a refund.Be warned,save your money. You may just want to wait until this movies airs on TV. I wouldn&#39;t recommend DVD either. A complete waste of money. You would think when they watched the finished project, that they realized then, we can&#39;t release this, it will not do well. I have no doubt this movie want be in theaters long. The local theater here is know for pulling movies that do not sale within the first three days of showing. The comedy in this movie was not good,it made no sense what so ever. The acting in some cases were very poorly executed. 
Will Friedberg and Seltzer ever learn? I knew this was going to be horrible.	Kennesaw, GA	The only good thing about this movie is that it spoofs both High School Musical and Hannah Montana, two things which feel so out of character for Disney and two things that I just don&#39;t like, basically because both franchises are directed towards girls. Which is better? Movies that you don&#39;t like or really bad movies? It&#39;s hard to tell, because really bad movies are bad on their own. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be fired after making 4 bad movies in one career. At this rate they&#39;ll probably surpass Ed Wood for the most bad movies made by certain people or a single person. These guys just don&#39;t learn. All four movies they made: Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and this are all unfunny. Kids and teenagers are seeing this because of the commercials advertising this movie. I recommend you not going to see it and the agony booth recap for Epic Movie is funnier than this. It is located here: http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/Epic_Movie_2007.aspx Man, they should stop this crap now! We&#39;ve seen too many unfunny spoof movies already. 
What a waste	United States	Actually, a minus 10 would be more Apropro. THE worst asinine, most stupid movie I have ever seen. Wish I could get my money back! I will be sure to make note of the directors and will not put myself through the torture of watching another of their movies. You want ten lines? I&#39;ll give you ten lines....stupid, asinine, ignorant, gross, humorless, incongruent, plot less, objectionable, senseless, dopey, waste of time, waste of money, ripoff, fake, poor acting, more fun to watch grass grow, more fun to watch paint dry, so loud, you might as well leave your cell phone on.. as you couldn&#39;t hear it anyway. Maybe you get the point.. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even my enemies. 
Parody is dead	United States	Once again that talentless duo that is Selzer and Friedberg show that they can sink lower than Meet The Spartans with this steaming waste of celluloid. I thought that Meet The Spartans scraped the barrel when it came to laughs but this cinematic abortion breaks through the bottom of the barrel to scrape the ground the barrel is on to get laughs and it still fails! These two chuckleheads still have the same bad habit of explaining the jokes to you as if you were retarded(if you liked this movie chances are you probably are retarded). For example if you have to explain to us what it is you&#x27;re making fun of like &#x22;Its an inconvenient truth, its global warming&#x22;, &#x22;Come here you Kung Fu Panda&#x22;, &#x22; I know because I saw Indiana Jones and The Kingdom Of the Crystal Skull&#x22;, &#x22;Let Me get my Get Smart phone&#x22;, &#x22; I thought I&#x27;d cheer you up with a high school musical&#x22;, What is this enchanted place&#x22; then you&#x27;re not really a genius but a racketeer that got by on the sheer stupidity of the average movie going public.<br><br>You know for a movie titled Disaster movie, you would think that they&#x27;d be spoofing movies like Twister, Dante&#x27;s Peak, Volcano, The Day After Tomorrow right? WRONG. The camera shakes a couple of times, You see some cheesy plastic asteroids, a couple of cows floating around and a very crummy CGI tornado. The movie targets films like Juno, Alvin and The Chipmunks, Superbad, High School Musical, Step Up, Enchanted, Kung Fu Panda, The Dark Knight and a slew of other summer blockbuster flicks including, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk and Hancock. Now tell me, what do these movies have to do with disaster movies? Nothing.<br><br>Nobody in this movie does anything that resembles acting and its safe to say that this &#x22;movie&#x22; is 100% laugh free. None of the &#x22;jokes&#x22; work and they just drag on for minutes at a time. Seltzer and Freidberg are unfunny hacks that killed a once funny genre with their grave dead brand of humor. If you want a good parody stick with Scary Movie(the first one), Top Secret, Duck Soup, Johnny Dangerously, Airplane, Not Another Teen Movie, Mafia!, Baseketball, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, Spaced Invades, Hot Shots(part one and Part Deux), The Naked Gun Series, Don&#x27;t Be A Menace, Im Gonna Git You Sucka, Last Action Hero(yeah, I said it), UHF, CB4, Hollywood Shuffle, Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid and every other spoof that came before the advent of Scary Movie 3. Disaster Movie is complete and utter garbage that even those brainless yokels that come on Jerry Springer wouldn&#x27;t find funny(yes, its THAT bad). Do not waste another dollar on these idiotic circus clowns (Seltzer and Freidberg)and their lame parodies. To the people that gave this movie positive reviews, pat yourselves on the back. You are responsible for the decline of quality in American Cinema. Parody is dead and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Freidberg are the undertakers.<br><br>Rest in Peace Parody 1933-2008 
The Perfect Title	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	In general, parody movies are entertaining and recommended when the viewer is upset, expecting to shutdown the brain and laugh with silly jokes. That was my expectation with when I selected &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; on DVD this Friday. Unfortunately this flick is AWFUL and I was incapable of laughing during the long 88 minutes running time. With the due respect the retards deserve, the &quot;directors&quot; and &quot;writers&quot; of this crap certainly have mental or education issues (or both), and I can not imagine how someone sane can produce and put money in this terrible production. The only thing that works perfectly is the original title of this disastrous flick. My vote is one (awful).<br><br>Title (Brazil): &quot;Super-Her&oacute;is, A Liga da Injusti&ccedil;a&quot; (&quot;Superheroes, The League of the Injustice&quot;) 
Spoof? I think not.	United States	I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a worst piece of mindless drivel in my entire life. I liked the Scary Movie films, don&#39;t get me wrong. They had some intelligent jokes, and left you to wonder which movie they were spoofing. Then came the outright &quot;spoof&quot; films: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Superhero Movie, Epic Movie, etc. They started making fun of films far more popular and far more creative then they could ever hope to be. The movie is full of Mad TV rejects and dropouts that the writers/directors have given sub-par jokes/gags to. The bottom line is this movie is an insult to your intelligence, and an insult to the movies they &quot;spoof&quot;. I think that Failburg and Seltzerwater (I personally like their name change, thanks to another writer on here) need to go back and watch some real spoof movies like Space Balls, or Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail, even Robin Hood: Men In Tights or Naked Gun. I will tell you this, I walked out of the movie after about 30 minutes. I got tired of seeing movies that were clearly better than any of the movies by these two jokers will ever be get dragged through the dirt with stupid, ill-written, badly performed, mindless comedy. It&#39;s clear that the writers and directors of this movie have severe ADD and have an IQ of about 30, which is what you&#39;ll need to actually enjoy this movie. Please avoid this movie at all cost, it only perpetuates the myth that Failburg and Seltzerwater are actually funny. 
As you might expect, terrible.	United States	It would be easy for someone to point fingers at this movie and say it would be terrible even before the trailer came out based on the fact that it was done by those two guys who made such crapshoots as Date Movie, Epic Movie, and the latest, Meet the Spartans. Then the trailer came out, giving us more of a reason to hate it.<br><br>And as you might expect, it was terrible. I think my reasoning for seeing this movie was because I had &quot;nothing else to do&quot; and I wanted something to &quot;make fun of&quot;. This movie is so frustratingly bad that you really don&#39;t feel a desire to make fun of it. It doesn&#39;t deserve it. There is clever funny, there is stupid funny, and there is ridiculous funny. This movie just isn&#39;t funny. It is just annoying. It just parodies the summer&#39;s movies in a way that is just annoying. Iron Man, Indiana Jones, whatever. It wasn&#39;t funny.<br><br>Just stay away. You probably already knew that but if you feel like you have nothing else to do as I did, trust me, staring at a wall is better. You will come out angry and upset that anyone would actually be stupid enough to make a film this atrocious. 
why? just why	new york city	why bother another one another one please stop why cant these people give it a break and why Hollywood just stop making movies period if were going to have an other one why cant they be a good director as the other directors out there I&#39;m surprised these guys even get lay ed. this movie will be forgotten right away after this 2 weeks why would they do this to them self are u going to show Ur kids that this what u made in Ur time Ur wrong they will hate u and they will never make friend cause of this this they did anything to put in 90 minutes but why. i feel like throwing up it would be better then watching this movie again please don&#39;t watch this movie the title says it all for crying out loud. stop this please don&#39;t even buy the DVD u people suck 
A crime against humanity	United States	Anyone who supports the creation of the intellectual equivalent of sewage by paying to see this movie should be charged with a crime against humanity. Freedom of speech and all, but there&#39;s no redeeming quality to these films.<br><br>I don&#39;t know why IMDb requires 10 lines of text to post a comment. I really said all I needed to say in the first paragraph. And everybody&#39;s said the same thing here - that these movies aren&#39;t even parodies. They&#39;re regurgitations. Of course, all of us here know that, so it must be a different audience who keeps going. If it&#39;s young &#39;uns who are going, I may need to consider moving to another country before they reach adulthood. Of course, they could scarcely do worse steering our country than the 50.1% of Americans who returned W. to office in 2004. Put those two phenomena together (the last 8 years and the popularity of these films) and I think we can officially call it sunset on the American Empire. Seriously. These movies are that bad. They shine light on the barren wasteland that is the interior of our populace&#39;s skulls. 
Really, Who Gives A F**k	None	That&#x27;s probably what the directors said when making this movie, though that should come as no surprise to anyone at this point. Once again Friedberg and Seltzer have teamed up to drive countless moviegoers to suicide with a new cinematic monstrosity the likes of which haven&#x27;t been seen since The Garbage Pail Kids Movie.<br><br>The acting is terrible. I have no idea who any of these actors are (I refuse to acknowledge Kim Kardashian as an actress after all the awful things SHE&#x27;S put out) but pretty much any hope they&#x27;ve ever had of a career was more or less destroyed by this movie. I&#x27;m still baffled that Tim Curry managed to survive Scary Movie 2.<br><br>The plot... There is no plot. There is no story. There is no CONFLICT. It&#x27;s just a group of stupid kids going around ripping off every single movie made in recent years (at the time of its release) while tornadoes and other disasters strike the area.<br><br>I wish a tornado had struck this movie during production...<br><br>And remember how previous Seltzer and Friedberg movies had &#x22;parodied&#x22; genre films (if you&#x27;re using the definition of someone who doesn&#x27;t know what parody is)that they were named after? Of course not, seeing as like me you&#x27;ve tried to pretend these movies never existed up to this point, but humor me on this. The title itself is a complete lie, holding no ties to the genre from which it takes its name other than being a complete disaster in and of itself.<br><br>Consider this my review for ALL Seltzer and Friedberg movies: they&#x27;re all a huge pile of cinematic fodder that should be cremated, buried and forgotten and their creators kicked out of Planet Earth. 
Never has a movie had a More Appropriate Title!	United Kingdom	Having seen the Scary Movie Series and many of the other works by this group of stars and Directors, my hopes for laughs were low...<br><br>But even i could not have predicted how bad this really would be...<br><br>Within the first 10 Minutes, we see possibly the WORST Amy Winehouse Look Alike EVER in one of the most UNFUNNY Movie Moments ever created... I was never a fan of Miss Winehouse, but dear god - How could anyone find this parody of her even remotely funny?<br><br>It seems that the Directors have now reached a pinnacle since the first ideas they ever had... Scary Movie was Rude and Crude and Broke Barriers - It was funny...<br><br>... Where this movie is like Epic Movie, Just plain CRUDE! So Crude that it is NOT FUNNY - END OF!<br><br>I watched it simply because it was on the TV... I am damn glad I never saw it at the Cinema or wasted my money buying the DVD...<br><br>There is an ART to doing PARODY... Being Crude is Great but only if you can do so with Intellect...<br><br>These people need to take a step back and look at the works of the Wonderful Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder and many more... They may be old and their humour may not match the new generation, but they had a class that made it work and made it funny!<br><br>Face it Fellas... You have no class... And trying to be crude when you have no class means you are just plain crude... And that means you FAIL!<br><br>How would I rate this Movie? Sadly, We cannot do Minus ratings... So My honest view is I don&#x27;t... Not even ONE STAR... But to submit my review I need to add one... And thats all it is getting! 
This movie is a full crime.	South Korea	My friend said &#x27;never watch this movie. It sucks it hurts your eyes and it&#x27;s bad for your brain&#x27;. He said this movie was the second worst film he ever saw. Because of the fact that my friend watched like thousands of films, I was a little afraid to watch this movie. Unfortunately, My curiosity won my worries. After I decided to watch this movie, my friend told me about a hundred times not to watch this movie. But I was to curios. Then last Sunday while my friend was watching the Simpson, I watched this film. <br><br>Before I start this review, let&#x27;s go over some types of movies. The first one is a movie that&#x27;s so good, you can hardly say anything after you watched it. Second: great, but not as good as the first one. Third: just good, forth: harmless, fifth: bad, sixth: very bad, seventh: a trash, and the last type: a movie that is used for torturing. This movie is used for the worst torture the humans has ever made.<br><br>I should have listen to my friend. This movie was a total disaster. I should have known that when I saw the title. This movie starts with some not-funny slapstick and a Cristal skull.(Yeah I know it sounds familiar but let&#x27;s just go through it). It&#x27;s something about &#x27;if you don&#x27;t place the Cristal skull back in it&#x27;s place then the world will come to an end&#x27;. Yeah really great plot. Let&#x27;s give a medal for it. So anyway, this person name Will breaks up with his girlfriend and celebrates his sixteen year-old party....... even though he&#x27;s not. Here, High School Musical comes out of nowhere and it&#x27;s worst than the original. Think about it, worst version of high school musical. Than the story suddenly turns into save Will&#x27;s girlfriend and Will meet&#x27;s all kinds of characters. Here comes some great shocks like BATMAN IS FLEEING, CARRYING A SUITCASE. I am dead serious batman is fleeing, carrying a suitcase. Not satisfied? How about this? Ironman and Hulk gets defeated by a cow and so does Hellboy. Juno gets killed by Elvin and the chipmunks who are really monsters, Kung Fu Panda is a man wearing a mask, Hancok is some guy drinking, Giselle is eating glass bottles, and Indiana Jones is an old man who is really really short. There are some other characters but I don&#x27;t want to talk about them right now. No don&#x27;t cry yet, because there is one last thing: a song on the last scene. Which is a song that I like to call f**k song. I&#x27;m not giving this name because the song is bad. I&#x27;m giving this name because THE SONG IS ABOUT F**KING. I&#x27;m not lying. There is a song like this. This song is.........terribly horribly, horridly, disastrously, painfully, sickly, awful. I&#x27;ll tell you this. Batman is playing the guitar. Okay? I repeat, Batman is playing the guitar.<br><br>Maybe there is a bad movie that you should watch or maybe there is a movie that&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s funny. But this film is not one of those films it cannot be one of those films. My friend caught a cold right after he saw this movie and so have I. This movie is just.........awful. No, awful isn&#x27;t the right word. There is not word in this whole universe that can describe this movie. Don&#x27;t watch this it&#x27;s bad for your brain, your eyes, your ears, your mind, and yourself. 
Whoever gave this film the green light...should be arrested	United States	because he actually got the red light and thought it was green.<br><br>See what happens when you democratize a medium and make it available to everyone. I mean, give someone a bunch of 35mm film stock, a Panavision camera and 25 million bucks, some hot chicks and dorky guys and they think that they can make a movie.<br><br>Movies like this are good though!<br><br>Because they can&#x27;t get any worse! And set the Jerry Springer crap bar even lower.<br><br>The plot is as thin as Kate Moss and the brain dead humor is lifeless even with real people saying the lines.<br><br>Just think, 25 million dollars could have: saved some turtles, fed some people, provided shelter for others, helped Red Cross, built houses in New Orleans, kept in the bank to load out to people needing money, provided 25 good filmmakers with a million bucks each, kept Leslie Nelson alive for a few more years, and could provide a dollar each for some 25 million people. 
Please, burn this	United States	This movie falls into the very rare category of films that are an example of &#x22;what NOT to do.&#x22; The plot is 100% muddled (makes no sense whatsoever). Try to imagine an episode of Family Guy with no plot, just one incomprehensible comedy clip after the other--that is Disaster Movie in a nutshell.<br><br>The only question is &#x22;Do you want the aspirin before or after you see this?&#x22; Please take my advice and don&#x27;t keep watching hoping it will get better -- it won&#x27;t! Just save your brain cells for a night of binge drinking or heavy metal music. Damaging your brain on those will be less painful. I hope everyone who saw it in the theater walked out and demanded a refund.<br><br>Yes, it&#x27;s that bad...I can&#x27;t even think of how to describe it...I just watched it and my head hurts so bad I have to cut this review short to get aspirin...later. 
Poor	Australia	horrendous!!! I didn&#x27;t laugh once during the entire movie. Save yourself 80 minutes! Give it a miss. Sadly I have to make up 10 lines about this movie. The movie does not deserve 10 lines but here we go anyway. I watched the superhero movie and that was funny, this was just not even worth a chuckle. I found this movie disjointed and it just basically struggled. I would be interested to know if anyone found it remotely funny. I gave it a 1, but it should be minus 10. I first saw the unbelievably hot Vanessa Minnillo in the TV show &#x22;True Beauty&#x22; and thought that she was pretty good in that. It is hard to believe that she went from the host of a TV reality show giving a good performance and then blew her credibility out the window by actually agreeing to participate in this garbage. I knew that this movie was going to blow by the four minute mark but I persisted with it hoping that it would get better or I would get a chuckle every now and then - but no - FAIL!!! The most ironic part of my day was that i watched a movie called Harpies - and that was worse! I think I have pi**ed Karma off, and I don&#x27;t know what I have done wrong!! ha ha ha 
Why.....?	United States	I had been almost certain that this was going to be better than &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22; but after I watched this, I actually thought about watching Meet the Spartans again. This movie was an EPIC fail! I don&#x27;t know what gives people the idea that we actually want MORE of these types of movies. They all pretty much fail. Scary Movie was entertaining but once they had made things such as Date Movie and Epic Movie, It all began to suck! I read though other comments and I saw a majority of people agreeing that this movie blows! I would NEVER even think about THINKING to recommend this movie to another person. Even taking the time to look at the back of the DVD case would be a waste of time! In conclusion of my review, I recommend that NO ONE picks up this movie. I don&#x27;t think even an 8 year-old could find any enjoyment of this film. ***DON&#x27;T WATCH IT!*** 
Havent we seen this sort of film 1479 times already?!  And, it was funnier the other 1478 times.	Bradenton, Florida	This film begins in 100001 BC and we see a caveman fall into a pile of Wooly Mammoth crap. Then, he&#x27;s attacked by a guy who looks like he&#x27;s from &#x22;American Gladiators&#x22; and then an Amy Winehouse look-a-like with fangs. Then he awakens and a Flavor Flav lookalike is in bed with him and his girlfriend in the present. Shortly after this, a dwarf exits the bed and gives the leading man the finger. While parody is supposed to be silly, these images are so random you wonder if the film was written or they just too darts and threw them at story ideas--all very, very fast and all which fell completely flat--and many of which were just very, very crude to hide that it wasn&#x27;t funny. And this, in a nutshell, is what follows for the next 90 or so minutes--one supposed parody after another after another--none of which made me laugh.<br><br>Here are my suggestions should they want to make another &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; or something like it: <br><br>1. Less jokes and slow down so you have time to work out the parodies. Quantity is NOT better than quality. Yet, at other times, unfunny skits go on and on and on and on and they had neither quantity nor quality. The Hannah Montana and &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; bits were beaten like dead horses.<br><br>2. Hire professional writers, not squirrels. I know they work cheap, but humor is NOT their forte.<br><br>3. Jokes about performing abortions with coat hangers aren&#x27;t funny. The film DID this and I am sure the entire theater when deadly silent. Like cancer and 9-11, this is NOT a good topic for comedy.<br><br>4. Jokes involving dwarfs can work, but generally not. Unless you can get Mini-Me, don&#x27;t bother.<br><br>5. Find talented actors and people who really can do parodies. It would also help if they vaguely look like the subject of the parody. Some did, many did not (like Hannah Montana).<br><br>6. &#x22;I just s#%$ myself&#x22; is not a particularly funny line. Avoid it.<br><br>7. Same goes for &#x22;suck on my placenta&#x22;. Not funny.<br><br>8. Keep the &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; stuff--it&#x27;s not great but compared to the rest of the film, it&#x27;s gold. Just shorten it A LOT--this skit went on way too long and became 100% stupid. In fact, it was only funny for about 30 seconds. <br><br>9. If you&#x27;re gonna use a lot of actors from &#x22;Mad TV&#x22;, try to get the more talented ones.<br><br>10. No poop jokes. Poop is not comedy gold. Poop is just poop.<br><br>11. No &#x22;Kunk Fu Panda&#x22;. No.<br><br>12. Get rid of Alvin and the Chipmunks unless you are willing to spend more than $13 for the puppets.<br><br>13. Keep Beowulf--one of the only funny characters in the film who stayed funny throughout. He came late in the movie, though, and by then I am sure most of the patrons left the theater or killed themselves.<br><br>14. And, speaking of kill--kill the director, producers, writers and all the actors. I&#x27;m not sure if this is legal, but I assume most judges and juries would allow this if they saw the film. 
Worst movie of the decade,worst parody movie ever.	Canada	Wow...well i saw this movie not too long ago and its hard to imagine someone actually finding the strength to hold in all they&#x27;re anger after spending even a penny on this piece of royal crap,I at first had no idea what to expect from this i thought it was going to be another parody film but this time about i guess disaster movies like maybe twister,volcano, or maybe &#x27;the day after tomorrow&#x27; or something but instead all we saw where a bunch of seriously disastrous attempts to make humour out of some of 2008&#x27;s best movie events like dark knight and Indiana Jones,and randomly Alvin and the chimp mucks..okkk,the entire movie was pointless and the protagonists where boring as hell,and at some times looked as though they knew they were committing a crime for being soo bad but tried anyways to make the audience laugh but then fail again and make me twice as angry.I don&#x27;t personally know anyone else who saw this movie except the people i was with when i saw it,but i never actually talked face to face with anyone else about it and i have no questions as to why,this movie should never have been in theatres or even directed at-all,other then maybe in someones basement on a cheap webcam by a guy who had nothing else to do and was probably high!...then erased 
Worst Movie Ever!	Canada	Easily the worst movie of all time! Not much more can be said. I can&#x27;t even begin to understand how any sort of time or effort was put forth into making this film a reality. Every joke was fail and absolutely nothing about this movie made me laugh in the slightest.<br><br>I will never get this time back, but what bothers me more than that is the fact that I could have used my own hand-held camera to make something better than this. Hell give me a 1000 budget I could make something 10x better than this absolutely disgusting piece of trash.<br><br>Anybody who reads this view on the movie or any others similar don&#x27;t even take a peek at this movie to see if it really is this bad. Just take peoples word for it and do something better with your life. I personally would have rather endured episodes of Barney and Friends. 
Id thought Id never see the day when Id see something worse than Home Alone 4, but with this monstrosity, it just goes to show how much I could be proved wrong.	United Kingdom	Disaster Movie gets my vote as the &#x22;new&#x22; worst movie ever made, and there have been abominations like Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat and NeverEnding Story 3, but none of them are as terrible as this, and that is saying something. I thought Disaster Movie crude, lazy and looming towards offensive, (what they said about Amy Winehouse was bang out of order) and some of the repeated gags wore well thin before the first attempt was finished. The script was laughable, the writers display no comedic talent and there is a complete lack of laughs, and I am sorry I found the characters very annoying, Giselle especially. The acting was terrible, in all my life, I have never seen such terrible acting, and believe me, I have seen a lot of films with terrible acting. Matt Lanter and Vanessa Minillo were not only given next to nothing to work with, likewise with Tony Cox, but their performances went nowhere. Everyone else was bad too, especially Carmen Electra, whose career I am surprised isn&#x27;t over yet, in every film she&#x27;s in, she shows a complete lack of acting ability. The film looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, and even the soundtrack was awful. Plus the title was completely irrelevant, very rarely did it spoof a disaster movie, all it did was try and be funny and failed miserably. Not even the characters spoofed here like Batman, the Chipmumks(a gross ditortion in character and more disturbing than cute and funny) and Hellboy could save this contemptible piece of excrement(I am trying to refrain from swearing, honestly I was seriously considering turning the DVD player off 20 minutes into the movie). My dad and brother told me it was very stupid, but unlike them, I am 17 by the way, I didn&#x27;t find it entertaining in the least bit. If you want a good spoof try the silly but otherwise hilarious Loaded Weapon 1! Avoid this thing at all costs! I rest my case, 0/10. Bethany Cox 
An Honest Review....	Canada	Anyone going into this film would automatically assume it would suck. The other films in the ______ Movie franchise have been garbage. Ladies and gentlemen, Disaster Movie is different.<br><br>The film is so funny and spot on with the spoofs that I almost died from laughter. All the actors turn in near perfect parodies of their characters. I actually thought I was watching Juno and her baby fight Sarah Jessica Parker from Sex And The City. The guy who played Hancock could be a twin for Will Smith, that is how good he is. He channel the Hancock character so well that I thought I was watching the Hancock sequel.<br><br>The film is so witty and on the spot with it&#x27;s comedy, it feels natural. So natural that there probably was no script. With a film like this, the joke write themselves. Throw whatever story you want in because it&#x27;s the comedy here that works. On second thought, the story works too. It&#x27;s leap and bounds over films that have been Oscar nominated. The story centre&#x27;s around these people and a crystal skull and some disaster that happens. Everything about it works.<br><br>The fight scenes are phenomenal. G. Thang plays a character called Calvin, he has a fight scene with a real life panda. Or at least I thought it was a real life panda, the animatronics and special effects in this film will rival Avatar, and it came out a year before it!!! Take that James Cameron. The fight between the two is so well choreographed that it makes Jackie Chan and his stunts look like child&#x27;s play.<br><br>The film has so many unexpected events. Who knew that a meteorite would come crashing down on Kim Kardashian. I sure didn&#x27;t. Speaking of Kim, she is more than just another pretty face. She was channeling something else here, I think she must have been in character for months before and after this film, because it is just too phenomenal. Daniel Day Lewis should be offering her his Oscar, that&#x27;s how good she is.<br><br>Ike Barinholtz, of MADtv fame, pulls an Eddie Murphy and a Mike Myers, by playing multiple roles. His range is out of this world. Who else could be able to pull off Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf, a police officer and Javier Bardem look a like, and Prince Caspian. I can only think of one man...and that is Ike Barniholtz.<br><br>I can&#x27;t stop recommending this film. It&#x27;s what the movies and film and cinema is all about. I wish I could watch it everyday for the rest of my life. Which is why I&#x27;m giving this the absolute best rating I can possibly give a film like this.
