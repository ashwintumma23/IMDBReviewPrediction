To call it a sequel is a travesty	None	 This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .<br><br>Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .<br><br>Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.  
The Greatest Film Ever Made	Canada	 The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.<br><br>As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.<br><br>The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.<br><br>Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.<br><br>The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (&quot;Keep your friends close .....&quot;, &quot;I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies&quot;), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.<br><br>All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.<br><br>The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.<br><br>The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.<br><br>See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent. 
One of the Best Sequels Ever	Canada, ontario	 You can count on one hand the movie sequels that measure up to the original; GODFATHER II makes the cut. This movie is just as fine as GODFATHER I. Here the director goes back and forth between the early days of the young Vito Corleone, played by Robert De Niro, and the family after the action in GODFATHER I in the 1950's just before Castro came to power. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has moved the family and most of his business to Nevada. Once again the acting is flawless. Diane Keaton as Michael's wife who quickly becomes disillusioned with her life with him and the lies he continues to tell her, assuring her that he is going legitimate soon; Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted brother and adviser; and Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth all give outstanding performances; but the film really is Al Pacino's. We see him become a ruthless, cold-blooded killer who alienates himself from his family in ways his father would never have done. He has come so far from the idealistic young man in &quot;GODFATHER I, who joined the Marines in World War I to serve his country and die for it if necessary, to a lonely, paranoid tragic man. There are many poignant scenes concerning his wife and children-- the drawing his son leaves for him in his bedroom, the gift that Tom buys the child because Michael is too busy, his wife Kay's being kept a virtual prisoner at his orders in the family compound, etc.<br><br>Once again many acts of violence are interwoven with religion: Michael's son's first communion, the religious parade in New York, Fredo's repeating the Rosary in order to catch a fish, for example. <br><br>The cinematography is stunning; the footage from Sicily and New York around the turn of the century and the snow scenes from the American West are beautiful and rich in detail. Mr. Coppola has directed yet another masterpiece.  
Great ensemble acting, great story, greatest sequel ever made.	Derbyshire, UK	 The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see. 
Breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur...	Mexico	Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by &quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot; in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...<br><br>Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...<br><br>The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...<br><br>De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...<br><br>The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...<br><br>Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters... 
&quot;The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made, one of the greatest films of all time and possibly finer than its superb predecessor *****&quot;	United Kingdom	The Godfather Part II (1974)<br><br>Number 1 - 1974<br><br>Top 3 - 1970s<br><br>&quot;My father taught me many things. Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer&quot;<br><br>&quot;The Godfather Part II is truly a masterpiece. Timeless, Classic, Beautiful and endlessly watchable&quot;<br><br>The second part of Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s Epic and violent Gangster Trilogy, follows the reign of Don Michael Corleone as the head of the Corleone family. As well the film shows us the early years of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and respect. Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part II exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy Award winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro. The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made. <br><br>This is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola&#39;s second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part. <br><br>&quot;As close to perfection as movies get&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pacino at his best&quot;<br><br>-10/10- 
Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under &quot;sprawl&quot;	New York City	Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.<br><br>The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.<br><br>Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) &quot;in the role&quot; of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.<br><br>After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the &quot;inside&quot; was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.<br><br>During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.<br><br>Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended &quot;flashback&quot; segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.<br><br>But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.<br><br>There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call &quot;J.K. Rowling Syndrome&quot;. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.<br><br>The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the d&eacute;nouement, which seems to just end.<br><br>I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.<br><br>The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.<br><br>Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see. 
A Masterpiece	United States	The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part of this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I was very surprised by this. The story is amazing, everything makes perfect sense. The Oscar winning screenplay is amazing, the dialogue is some of the most original, and realistic ever putt on screen, the characters are flawless, and it's in every way perfectly written. The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless. 
One of the greatest sequels ever made	United States	 After seeing The Godfather and improving it as one of my favorite films, I wanted to get more into The Godfather so I rented this. Words can't describe how great this sequel was. The acting once again was amazing and the story and how the movie went on just never got me bored. Everything in this movie was clearly beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more. You have to see this movie because it's just brilliant filmaking. It's not better than it's first film but still an extremely worth sequel.<br><br>10/10  
A Hollywood Masterpiece!!!!	USA	 Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb. 
The Greatest Sequel During  the Cinema's History	United States	 &quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot; is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5. 
An Insult To Call It A Sequel	Queens, New York	To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and you&#39;ll see I&#39;m not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.<br><br>The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.<br><br>The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.<br><br>The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleone&#39;s life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.<br><br>Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.<br><br>The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one. 
Terrific continuation of the &quot;Godfather&quot; series; to call it a &quot;sequel&quot; almost seems insulting...	UK	This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as &quot;sequel&quot; is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; is a sequel - &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.<br><br>The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. <br><br>Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).<br><br>Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.<br><br>Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in &quot;The Godfather Part II,&quot; Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.<br><br>It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. &quot;The Godfather&quot; was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a &quot;sequel&quot; almost seems insulting. 
About as good as the first one, but mainly because of De Niro	Denmark	 It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10 
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Godfather of all sequels	India	The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vito&#x27;s death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michael&#x27;s journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.<br><br>Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brando&#x27;s portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppola&#x27;s brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzo&#x27;s masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rota&#x27;s poignant score and Gordon Willis&#x27; vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.<br><br>http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/ 
As good as the original...	Canada	Sequel to the original Godfather is slower moving than the original but maybe better. The first was fresh material and Brando&#39;s presence was a huge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today.<br><br>Michael&#39;s descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. Hey, it&#39;s not easy holding a crime empire together. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? It&#39;s a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.<br><br>Pacino&#39;s performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when Michael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. Pacino just nails the part.<br><br>The secondary story is the rise of Michael&#39;s father, Vito Corleone and we watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part, if that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don Fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of Death himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. How many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiro&#39;s look? <br><br>What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of it&#39;s generation is convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales visibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know right then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on him. By DeNiro&#39;s expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man. That&#39;s unsurpassed acting.<br><br>The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900&#39;s New York, in the Italian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. That&#39;s sheer magic. Once again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie.<br><br>Some weak points: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the other actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual, especially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.<br><br>The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito vs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their empire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see where the results have taken both.<br><br>One of the greatest films of all time. 
Sorry, but it just didn&#39;t deliver	Mexico	OK. Let&#39;s get real. The Godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. I&#39;m not giving comments on The Godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. Nevertheless, I expected much more on part II. Personally, I didn&#39;t like it. Here&#39;s the deal: the story was way too slow paced. Nothing really happened. Only the hit on Michael&#39;s house, and the build up for young Vito&#39;s story was what makes you interested. The rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs weren&#39;t as quotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation of the real thing.<br><br>Al Pacino&#39;s performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasn&#39;t that. The whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he talks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once had. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. Now, his son is just pure evil. And that doesn&#39;t make sense. In the book, it&#39;s clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So, what happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesn&#39;t kill anyone from his own family (not &quot;the Family&quot;, the real one). I know, Michael did kill Carlo, but let&#39;s remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another thing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive Don&#39;s daughter to... Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. <br><br>It&#39;s interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppola&#39;s anatomy for each &quot;Godfather&quot;. You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it wasn&#39;t&#39;s that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.<br><br>Another flaw I found was that the story doesn&#39;t really stick to the book. One key aspect in the film didn&#39;t even appear in Mario Puzo&#39;s novel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who had his family killed doesn&#39;t even matter. Still, the scene prominently explains Don Tomassino&#39;s condition from the first.<br><br>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. I&#39;m a die hard fan of &quot;The Godfather&quot;. I consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). But part II just doesn&#39;t do it for me. 
A decent follow-up but not great as far as  I&#x27;m concerned	Canada	&#x22;The Godfather: Part II&#x22; hit theatres a couple of years after the first film and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it is routinely listed alongside the original as one of the best American films of all time.<br><br>The story picks up a few years after the end of the first film. Michael is firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to Nevada where he is edging the family towards legitimacy. However, when he is beset by betrayals he systematically sets about dealing with the betrayers mercilessly. There is also a second story thread (told in flashback) that traces the early years of Vito Corleone and his introduction to mob life.<br><br>The film clocks in at a hefty 200 minutes. Unlike the first film, though, I couldn&#x27;t really get caught up in either of the parallel stories so the film seemed to drag quite a bit. I didn&#x27;t find the Vito storyline particularly compelling and the Michael storyline is little more than a convoluted extension of part one. These stories were meant to be compared but I don&#x27;t feel that the director or the editor really constructed the film optimally for this purpose. Nevertheless, the film still has a classic scene or two, though it&#x27;s nowhere near as consistent as the first film.<br><br>Most of the actors whose characters survived the first film reprised their roles here. Returnees Al Pacino &#x26; Talia Shire each landed Oscar nominations and so did newcomers Michael V. Gazzo &#x26; Lee Strasberg. However, the only actor to take home an Oscar statuette was Robert De Niro for his portrayal of the young Vito Corleone. Personally, I think that Pacino gave the best performance of the film.<br><br>Francis Ford Coppola won an Oscar for his direction but I feel that the first film was a better effort. From a visual standpoint the film is attractive, though, and the Nino Rota score was justly rewarded with an Oscar.<br><br>Ultimately, I don&#x27;t feel that &#x22;The Godfather: Part II&#x22; lives up to its pedigree. I&#x27;ve watched it a few times, so I&#x27;d say that I&#x27;ve given it a fair shake. That being said, I realize that I&#x27;m in the vast minority here so it must be a personal thing. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, &#x22;Chinatown&#x22; deserves the Best Picture Oscar that went to this film. 
Not Far Behind The First Film	United States	This isn&#39;t quite as powerful as the first Godfather, done two years earlier, but it isn&#39;t far behind. It&#39;s another magnificently filmed effort, wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once you&#39;ve put it in your tape or DVD player.<br><br>What makes this a notch below the first Godfather is the absence of Marlon Brando and a little too much disjointedness with flashbacks. Also missing from this film was the volatile James Caan. He was shown in a flashback scene near the end, and that was it.<br><br>One thing was just as good if not better than the first film, and that was the cinematography. The browns, blacks, greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes. I especially love the Italian houses and scenery. Why this was not even nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography is mind-boggling.<br><br>The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael (Al Pacino). It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.<br><br>There are some excellent supporting performances in this film, too. I especially would cite the roles played by Michael Gazzo and Lee Strassburg. 
Overwritten Script Takes Away from What Could-Have-Been	United States	The sequel to &quot;The Godfather,&quot; at times, was just as impressive, and sometimes even more impressive than the original. Overall, though the film struggles with it&#39;s flashbacks to an early New York as we watch a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rise to power. &quot;The Godfather II,&quot; wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. When we&#39;re in the present time watching Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fight off Senators that are trying to squeeze him, or when we&#39;re watching his house get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone very close to the family we always find our self in amazement. When we jump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. The script is to blame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in it&#39;s near three hour run time. When we&#39;re in the early 1920s we see things that are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to being on par with the present day status of the Corleone family. Its good to know and see how the godfather started out, but there&#39;s too much to say and not enough time to say it. The bloated section of the film becomes underwritten. We don&#39;t really learn anything about Vito Corleone that we didn&#39;t already know. We don&#39;t really see how he gains his power. He kills &quot;The Black Hand,&quot; and one day, through rumors, he becomes the Don of the city. Just like that. Just like that? Really? Then we come back and he&#39;s all of a sudden in the Olive Oil business. We don&#39;t know how he got there or anything, he&#39;s just there. De Niro gives it his best, but he&#39;s just not working with anything to give any kind of performance that&#39;s remotely on the same level as Brando did in the previous film. I found it painful to watch De Niro try to imitate Brando. <br><br>When we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its convincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art direction, are very good. We never see big wide shots of the city block. We see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly moving camera. Coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too far (Probably didn&#39;t have the budget to make a huge set of the city), but we get a claustrophobic sensation. The kind of claustrophobic sensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close enough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a sack full of guns. Coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very well. There are some great moments in the flashbacks, but I could have lived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much better film (Possibly better than the original). <br><br>When Michael finds that his own brother, Fredo (John Cazel), knew about the assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and that he never told Michael about his connection with Hymen Roth and Johnny Ola, it infuriates Michael to the point of no return. He feels as though he loses his family. When he confronts Fredo, he doesn&#39;t say much; he&#39;s sick of him; Fredo&#39;s too stupid to have around, and he can&#39;t even look at him. Coppola&#39; direction here is magnificent. Even though its dark and you can&#39;t see the reactions of both of the men, they&#39;re both in the picture with the light shinning through the windows creating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body language, and the body language tells us everything we need to know.<br><br>Cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish we got to see more from his character. He&#39;s so good in this one scene that it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge part of that is due to him. The words that come out of his mouth are on par with Marlon Brando&#39; speech in, &quot;On the Waterfront.&quot; All this frustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. He&#39;s pleading with his brother. We watch him spill his guts on the table, and admit that he&#39;s well aware of being stupid and feeding into that stereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel his pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and callousness of his family. He feels like an outsider, a coward, and a loser. All the while, Michael sits in front of the window looking at the boathouse. He doesn&#39;t care what Fredo has to say, which makes it all that more painful to watch for the both of them. Michael wants information from him, and that&#39;s it. One feels like an outsider, and one is an outsider. Neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins both of their lives. Fredo wants respect and power. Michael has the power, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he ever cared about: his family. Its one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history. 
&#x22;It had nothing to do with business&#x22;	Ruritania	In the movies, sequels have always been difficult. The franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. While the following decades saw the rise of the TV series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. Today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. That tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to The Godfather.<br><br>Being a drama, The Godfather Part II&#x27;s biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. Al Pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. John Cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making Fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. Welcome returns are also made by Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. However the greatest turn is that of newcomer Robert De Niro. De Niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of Marlon Brando&#x27;s middle-aged Don in The Godfather. It&#x27;s still only a small demonstration of De Niro&#x27;s talents however.<br><br>Perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. Take, as one example out of many, the scene where Pacino and Lee Strasberg first meet. Roth&#x27;s wife greets Pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way Coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. Coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as she&#x27;s not a character we need to remember, he doesn&#x27;t allow us to connect with her visually. This is really intelligent filmmaking.<br><br>But The Godfather Part II is more than ever about stunning imagery. With a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, Coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. This is especially true in the young Vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and the production design team lead by Dean Tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. It&#x27;s intriguing how Coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of.<br><br>And yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. There are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the Cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. This inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying &#x22;They&#x27;re carving up Cuba &#x96; geddit?&#x22; But instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have Hyman Roth going on about his stupid cake. And what&#x27;s more, there are too many references to the best ideas in The Godfather &#x96; the dark Lake Tahoe office where Michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end &#x96; all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. None of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. The Godfather Part II is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. In fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel. 
Godfather II Stunk	United States	Godfather Two is Coppola&#39;s movie---and he had no instincts for the mafia. The Godfather author, Mario Puzo, objected to having Michael kill his own brother, but finally gave in to keep his share of the Hollywood millions.<br><br>Godfather Two has lightweights as heavies: the drunken New York mob guy and Hyman Roth can&#39;t compare to Barzini, Sollozo, and the other heavyweight bad guys of the original Godfather written by Puzo.<br><br>Godfather Two loses the atmosphere of the mob while it meanders lengthily into Cuba.<br><br>The main point that makes Godfather Two inferior is that it does not contain a single sympathetic character.The endless scenes in the Lake Tahoe home of Michael&#39;s are tiresome, dreary after a while, and lack interest as compared to the original Puzo story.<br><br>This movie shows a deterioration from the original, just as the mob has deteriorated in recent years.<br><br>Coppola had no right to think he could write his own Godfather, and his inferiority to Puzo when it comes to dealing with the mob shows up here in technicolor.<br><br>Meanwhile, poor Mario Puzo watched his story being degraded by the instinctless Coppola, objected at first, and then gave in. Pathetic.<br><br>The only scenes that actually ring true here are from the original Puzo book (the earlier life of Vito Corleone).<br><br>The contrast between the dreary Coppola script of Godfather Two and its dreary characters is brought home strongly by the final (flashback) scene where Sonny Corleone and the others are around the table. As soon as Sonny appears, everything comes to life. 
A few historic flaws, but one of the best glimpses into turn-of-century NYC	New York City, NY	What else can be said about The Godfather series? One small gripe: The storyline shows young Vito Corleone (Robert Deniro) murder the local boss, then basically take control of the neighborhood. Historically, there would have been a dozen other guys in line to take the boss&#x27;s spot -- young Vito, with no real connections outside of his petty thief neighbor, would have been disposed of immediately. In real life, bosses were bred into the position or it was taken hostilely from the inside. By the era that this movie portrays, Sicilian black handers and Neapolitan Camorra (among others) were fairly organized -- But, hey, its a (great) movie :) 
In Some Ways Even Better Than the First One...	United States	Seven years after the first film, Michael Corelone (Al Pacino) continues his family&#39;s quest to become legitimate. Also, more on his father&#39;s growing up in Sicily and coming to America. With Vito being played not by Marlon Brando, but Robert DeNiro.) If you liked the first film, you will like this film. If you didn&#39;t, you won&#39;t. It&#39;s really that simple, since you have all the same great people coming together for this film with just as solid a script and acting as you did the first time. You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.<br><br>This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.<br><br>Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.<br><br>If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone? I cannot make any suggestions for part three, though, one way or the other. 
I really think this is the greatest movie ever made...	New Zealand	Wow. This thing is almost three and a half hours long and yet it is not boring for a second. Not one moment. From the very first scenes up until the tragic and forlorn ending, this film seizes hold of the viewer&#x27;s consciousness and does not ever loosen its grip, even when the credits roll. I walked away from the movie with what felt like a deep resonance inside me. It is at once heart-wrenchingly sad and stunningly beautiful.<br><br>Thematically, it actually shares much in common with later films such as American Beauty and Fight Club. The Godfather Part 2 is the story of a man who seems to have it all - but the only things he ends up not having are the only things that truly matter to him. Michael&#x27;s character arc continues on from the first film, creating a great, epic tragedy and what I think is one of the saddest and yet most majestic endings in film.<br><br>I haven&#x27;t even talked about the more technical aspects yet. This is because I don&#x27;t have to - everything is perfect. Not just great, but perfect, as in there seems to be no way that they could be improved on. Acting, direction, cinematography, script and story. Everything.<br><br>The one thing, though, that clinches it for me is that the plot doesn&#x27;t really matter. This is a movie about themes and ideas. The plot is quite thick, so don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t get it - you don&#x27;t have to. As long as you understand what the film is really about... you will walk away knowing that you have witnessed something almost life-changing. 
The Greatest Movie the World has Ever Seen...	India	I personally think that this film surpassed the glory of The Godfather I. you will have to watch it time and again in order to understand the nuances of it&#39;s brilliant film-making. the characterizations are exceptional: 1. Micheal Corleone (as the new don torn between family &amp; business) 2. Hyman Roth (as the scheming old villain) 3. Kay Adams Corleone (as the worried wife) 4. Robert Duvall (as the loyal lawyer) 5. John Cazale (as the betraying brother) 6. Robert DeNiro (as young Vito) etc. etc.... It&#39;s just Brilliant!!! Speaking about the film-making the parallel narration of two different but interlinked stories is a fresh new lease of screenplay. the cinematography is outstanding. the indoors are lit up beautifully with overhead lighting which puts a shadow over the characters&#39; eyes making it impossible to say what they&#39;re thinking. But unlike the first part where they had broken all the rules (the characters are established first before the place and time) in this film they&#39;ve come back to the rules (the locations are established before the characters) Francis Ford Coppola should definitely be given another chance to make a sequel to the trio-logy so that the present generation can also experience the &#39;Magic of the Movie&#39; and for anyone who&#39;s not seen this film, I bet they&#39;re surely missing something in life... 
The Godfather: Part II	Seattle, WA	&quot;It&#39;s not easy to be a son, Fredo. It&#39;s not easy.&quot; Is undeniably the best sequel ever made and one of the best films ever made. First off, Robert De Niro&#39;s performance as the young Don Corleone completely owns. Pure genius, pure craft.<br><br>Secondly, well it&#39;s Pacino, all Pacino. One pure example, at its best is when Diane Keaton&#39;s character confesses to him &#39; it wasn&#39;t a miscarriage&#39;&#39; revealing that instead she had an abortion, so that she wouldn&#39;t bring him anymore sons into the world. Watch Pacino&#39;s face during this entire scene!!!!!!!! Or the last flashback scene where Michael reveals that he has joined the Marines to the disgust of his family and such, at this time he had his own &#39; dreams&#39; now, we simply watch the price which Michael Corleone has paid himself for power. 
Astonishingly unapproachable, bored me to tears	None	I have been forced to watch the Godfather trilogy by a friend of mine who thinks, as do most people, that they are the best thing since sliced bread. I found &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; just about watchable, but no more - I would have given up if my friend hadn&#x27;t been there, but this was completely intolerable. I couldn&#x27;t follow who the people were (and didn&#x27;t care) I couldn&#x27;t relate it to the previous film. I couldn&#x27;t relate the 1930s stuff to the 1950s stuff. There is no excitement no tension, no nothing. A complete waste of an evening. And it&#x27;s so interminably long too. I&#x27;m having trouble filling out my ten lines for the review, because the film left almost no impression on me - except that feeling that I used to get at school when I was forced to sit through the most boring lesson in the world. And God help me, I&#x27;m going to have to watch the third one. Like taking cod-liver oil. Ugh. 
Best Supporting Actor - Robert De Niro	London, England	 After the success of 'The Godfather' and having been turned down for a part in the first film, Robert De Niro follows hot on the heels of Al Pacino by being cast as the younger version of Vito (Marlon Brando). In it, we see a 30 year old Robert De Niro being taken from being a clean cut young man, probably not as striking as Pacino with his large brown eyes and dark hair, but interesting to look at none the less. Although not innocent looking, De Niro goes from being clean cut to being the gangster that we have come to know and love in the 80's and 90's at the guiding hand of Francis Ford Coppola. No wonder he won the award for 'Best Supporting Actor' to Pacino's leading role. As a whole, the film wasn't as cinematic as the first one, the range of characters that dominated the predecessor was not there is this follow up. However, the film was dominated by Robert De Niro, and it's almost a pity that De Niro and Pacino didn't meet. They would have to wait until 22 years later when they would team up in 'Heat'. 
Tremendous follow up to &#39;The godfather&#39; though Brando is missed	India	Part II in &#39;The Godfather&#39; saga carries on in much the same vein though Marlon Brando is sorely missed. The plot has Al Pacino exerting complete dominance as mafia boss in the fifties. The film also depicts young Vito Corleone&#39;s (Robert De Niro) early years. This segment is slightly nostalgic but superbly acted by De Niro who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. As a result of the film moving both backwards and forwards in time, it feels more convoluted than the first part. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton both impress. The shocking climax (MINOR SPOILERS) mirrors the ending of the first film. Highly recommended.<br><br>Overall 9/10 
The perfect sequel	London, UK	The accepted wisdom about sequels is that they tend to be less good than their predecessor as there is no story left to tell. The second Godfather is an embarrassment of riches in as much as there are two stories; the back-story of Vito Corleone&#39;s arrival in America and that of Michael making good his grip on the inherited business.<br><br>All the fine film-making that made the first so rich has been replicated and improved in this most handsome movie. Again we begin with a great set-piece (a Catholic confirmation) as a swarming expository melange of character and situation but which takes its rather more sober tone from the film&#39;s prologue, telling of Vito&#39;s flight to America. The familial infections that poison this particular, warped Italin-American dream are doubly intense given that Michael is now the capo - where the threats of the first came from without, now there is danger within.<br><br>Pacino&#39;s performance is first-class, never once resting on the laurels of his previous Oscar nomination. He is matched across the board by the rest of ensemble; Diane Keaton, Duvall and the twitchy Cazale are fine, and I&#39;ve always been a fan of Talia Shire whose performance as the Michael&#39;s widowed sister is a magnificent, discreet study in intractable sororial bitterness and love. A deeply sad and violent movie but one which never rules out the possibility of sympathy or redemption. An awesome achievement. 9/10 
As good as the original!	None	I remember saying in my review of &quot;The Godfather&quot; that i was going to review this film a week later, that was more than one week ago that&#39;s for sure. I did actually start watching &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; the next Friday, though i stopped watching after an hour because i wasn&#39;t really in the mood for it! So i decided that today, with nothing else to do, i&#39;d give it another try and i wasn&#39;t disappointed! It was a great film, lots of talking but it&#39;s still great fun to watch. <br><br>I only have one criticism, the length. It was extremely long, about 3 and a half hours! But that&#39;s my only criticism, everything else was spot on! Hopefully i&#39;ll be watching &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot; soon and as soon as i do, i&#39;ll post my opinion right here! <br><br>So overall, &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot; is just as good as the original Godfather If you haven&#39;t seen this film yet, watch it now!<br><br>9/10 
Great Movie. Another Winner from Francis Ford Copolla	United States	Warning! Spoilers Ahead!<br><br>&quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot; is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movie&#39;s strengths lie in Copolla&#39;s retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesn&#39;t differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.<br><br>Pacino&#39;s Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous &quot;scream&quot; to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper: one minute he&#39;s calm, the next he&#39;s in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keaton&#39;s performance is usually cited as the weakest of the &quot;Godfather&quot; saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.<br><br>The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinema&#39;s most memorable characters. One minute he&#39;s a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian &quot;tarantella&quot;; the next he&#39;s viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michael&#39;s control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played &quot;The Turk&quot; Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasberg&#39;s Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the film&#39;s main antagonist. Roth&#39;s true evil is only revealed in other characters&#39; dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasn&#39;t fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we don&#39;t actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous &quot;This is the Business We&#39;ve Chosen&quot; speech he gives to Michael.<br><br>Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We don&#39;t see much of Fredo in Part I, but he&#39;s essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naivet&eacute;, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roth&#39;s scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that &quot;there was something in it for me!&quot;, but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredo&#39;s ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga: fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a &quot;Hail Mary,&quot; right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the &quot;family business.&quot; <br><br>Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael &quot;loses his family,&quot; in terms of his wife&#39;s abortion and departure, and Fredo&#39;s treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michael&#39;s mother tells him &quot;you will never lose your family.&quot; <br><br>This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copolla&#39;s further career is debatable. Radio host Phil Hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of Copolla&#39;s career: &quot;what do you mean &#39;Charlie don&#39;t surf?!&#39;&quot;) He directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. This is a highly recommended movie. 
Parts of the Book That Were Left Out in Part One...	United States	...are included in Part II. This movie gives you the backstory of Vito Corleone&#39;s rise to power, from the time his father is murdered in Sicily until he &quot;makes his bones&quot; and creates his own empire in the United States. Robert DeNiro is very convincing as young Vito Corleone in what was, if memory serves correctly, is his big screen debut. I was almost convinced he was somehow related to Marlon Brando, he had the voice, the looks, the mannerisms, everything. Couple this with another story not included in the book of betrayal within the family while Michael tries to make a move in pre-Castro Cuba and you have a sequel that is every bit as good as the original. Michael has been stripped of all his humanity in this story, and he comes across as being a cold and heartless human being, one who would even have his own brother killed to preserve his nefarious empire. The ending is heartbreaking because he realizes that he lost his family trying to save it. And the soundtrack in this movie is even better than the original GODFATHER soundtrack. For the third time, I&#39;m going to give a perfect 10 to this movie. 
Best movie I have ever seen	United States	I got the privilege to watch this film for the first last a few days ago. This has to be my favorite film of all time, along with one of the best films that I have ever seen.<br><br>The movie does very well in shown two different two stories in one movie. You have Michael&#39;s story of which shows his struggle in controlling one of the most powerful crime families in the United States. The second story is Vito Corleone&#39;s struggle as young boy in Sicily growing up and coming to America, and his start of the Corleone crime family.<br><br>This is a long film to watch, it took me a few days to watch it, as I watched about 30 to 40 minutes at a time.<br><br>All of the actor and actresses preformed there roles very well, and the actors and actresses who got Oscars for their roles in this movie were VERY WELL deserved. Robert De Niro does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in film, in my opinion one of the best actor&#39;s in 1974.<br><br>The script is well written and for the most part is easy to follow.<br><br>If you seen the first film, which is a must to understand this film, then you will like the second one, which is one of the best films of 
One of the best films of all time	Canada	The Godfather II, in my opinion, is just as good as the first. So rare is it for a sequel to be as gripping and as well-made as this movie is. First off, I have to mention the excellent musical score. It gives the film a sort of dark, moody atmosphere, and I think it was a very good idea to use the same score as in part I. Secondly, the idea of inter wining the story of Michael Corleone and of his early father Vito was brilliant and makes this sequel stand out from the first part. This idea of showing two stories in one film could have been quite risky and confusing but Coppola did a fantastic job at it. Both stories are very clear to follow and show the contrast between Vito and his son&#39;s way of handling the family business.<br><br>Of course, I cannot comment on this movie without mentioning Al Pacino&#39;s awesome performance. He definitely should have won the best actor&#39;s Oscar for that role. He has unbelievable screen presence and plays incredibly well the ruthless, suspicious Michael Corleone. The most poignant scene of the film, in my opinion, is definitely the one where Michael finds out at the party that his brother Fredo betrayed him. 
The Economics of Destiny	London, UK	 Sequels rarely rise to the level of the original, and almost never surpass them. This phrase has been used so often in reference to &quot;The Godfather: Part II&quot; &#150; the exception that makes the rule. What is even more laudable is the fact that the original is generally considered as a landmark in the history of film.<br><br>This is one film that proves cinema to be a form of art, and not merely one of entertainment. A skilful direction from Francis Ford Coppola, outstanding performances from the likes of Pacino, De Niro, Gazzo, Strasberg, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton, Shire, memorable cinematography from Willis, a soundtrack by Rota, Coppola and Curet Alonso, and an ingenious script by Coppola and Puzo (partly adapted from his novel), make &quot;The Godfather: Part II&quot; stand out as a story of courage, love, treachery, and devotion, crafted in the life of the Corleone saga.<br><br>The plot follows the consolidation of power of Michael Corleone, and his desire to gain the legality of his business, and the consolidation of power of a young Vito Corleone, and his desire to build a better life for his family. The old story of the father handing his wealth to his sons, gains a new twist by allowing a positive outcome to the original story. The wealth remains in the family, but there are losses to be incurred. An ontological thesis of Pareto optimality into the organisation of social structures is subtly brought into the view, without harming the general development of the story.<br><br>&quot;The Godfather: Part II&quot; remains also as a text book for any actor. Al Pacino shows that temperance can be dramatic, making us empathise with his character even when made to realise the most brutal of actions.  Robert De Niro is purely outstanding, in one of the best supporting performances the screen has witnessed. His charm, charisma, and vocal skills, help him achieve a complete transition to Puzo's Vito Corleone. The viewer is unarmed in the choice given between murder and love, between life and necessity. Talia Shire stands out as the lost woman in a world dominated by men.<br><br>Even if &quot;The Godfather&quot; is the point of reference when it comes to great cinema, &quot;The Godfather: Part II&quot; remains a powerful example which proves that there is always more to say in a story, and the additions can be more than surprising.  
prefer the deniro flashbacks	usa	 someone made the comment that he didn't understand why the flashbacks to don corleone's rise to power (with de niro as don vito) were included, that it romanticized the Mob.  i think the reason that we have the 2 stories is that they parallel each other.  while we are seeing how michael corleone is developing as a mob boss and as a man, and what forces are shaping him, we also see the same things in his father's early life - how don vito reacted to events, how he made plans and how he became the man he was.  although both men lived a life of crime the difference in the two is striking and real - don vito worked his way out of poverty and immigration and tried to help his fellow italians in a way that seemed to work for him.  don vito never lost his sense of caring for people in general and that they depended on him.he never lost his love for his family.  he never lost the common touch, the things that would endear a man to a community and win their loyalty.  when we look at michael in his criminal growth we see he becomes a completely different man - cold, ruthless, uncaring and increasingly isolated both from his family and from the greater community.  don vito actually served, however wrongfully, a purpose in his community and did some good - he provided political and financial assistance, and a basic justice to many people who would have been denied it otherwise.  michael corleone however is just a nasty, vicious, unfeeling, opportunist who does not have the same human touch his father did. and i think that is the main revelation of the 2 movies and why we have the flashbacks.  frankly i prefer the first movie, and the flashbacks in the 2nd movie - don vito was a better man. 
Hate Michael by the end.	Alexandria, Virginia	 By the end of this classic sequel to &quot;The Godfather&quot;, I absolutely felt nothing but hatred for Michael Chorleone.  Even though he waited until his mother faded off to kill Fredo, I still couldn't feel anything for Mike. But when you see the last shot of the film, you realize that he is going to regret it for as long as he lives and will fall into a deep depression for the next decade or so.  How could he be so mad at Fredo for being tricked by those two rats, Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola. That wasn't exactly all Fredo's fault. But, you not only do you feel the neglect from Michael to Fredo, but you feel the neglect from Michael to his family and household.  That was one of the really haunting parts of the film.  Michael's neglect is what causes him to fall into the deep depression by the end of the film and into the third installment of the trilogy.  Francis Ford Coppola has a true gift in film making and to this day remains one of the best directors in the business. The best of the trilogy.<br><br>10/10 The best film ever made. *****/***** 
Touching perfection...	Greece	Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; the &#x22;The Godfather: Part II&#x22;. &#x22;The Godfather: Part II&#x22; is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba.<br><br>In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. <br><br>&#x22;The Godfather: Part II&#x22; is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title &#x22;Touching perfection...&#x22;, but it continues to be the best sequel of all times. 
Travesty abounds.	United States	The Godfather: Part II is not a sequel in the traditional Hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in The Godfather. Here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers Michael&#x27;s reign as the new head of the Corleone family by moving the business to Nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young Vito Corleone came to power and started the story now being continued.<br><br>Francis Ford Coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner Mario Puzo to expand on Michael and establish Vito and doing so by going back and forth. This leads to some incredible shots of the young Vito and the young Michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. It also shows how far Coppola has come in terms of directing these films. Once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between Michael and Vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story.<br><br>All this aside, I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. The flawless acting continues here with Al Pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as Michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. Indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different Michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and the tragic John Cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and Robert De Niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal Vito.<br><br>Once again, Gordon Willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. This adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and I cannot argue. They are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make.<br><br>The final two scenes are quite something to behold. The first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for Vito to surprise him on his birthday. Here, we see how Michael truly was treated and how Sonny, Tom, and Connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. The final scene is Michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. It is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. And these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity. 
pretty amazing	None	You&#x27;re not allowed to dislike this film either. This is a massive achievement in every possible sense. Indeed, there is little that rivals these two films in opulence or production scale.<br><br>Coppola doesn&#x27;t shy away from trying new things. Michael Corleone&#x27;s story-arc is more realistic, more ambitious than anything in the first film. The scale of crime is upgraded. And I had never expected to see that scene between Michael &#x26; Kay, where she tells him of her departure, &#x22;because of this 2000-year-old Sicilian thing.&#x22; Vito Corleone&#x27;s backstory follows the earlier, more conventional combination of style and myth. Actually, Coppola makes Vito&#x27;s arc too obvious, as though he&#x27;s following a checklist. But again its very tastefully done, so you enjoy it.<br><br>I guess what this film lacks is a simpler plot and the phenomenal pacing of the first film. Also missing is the magisterial presence of a certain Marlon Brando. It is easier to appreciate this film when you place it together with the first, as one single epic of the rise of one Mafia generation, followed by the decline of another. 
Slightly better than the original	Philippines	This companion piece of the godfather shows two parallel stories: the tale of Vito Corleone&#39;s(brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro) simple life in New York and his subsequent rise as a head of a crime empire. the other story shows Michael Corleone&#39;s(Al Pacino, in an Oscar worthy performance) succession as the new head of the Corleone family. In my opinion this is slightly better than the original, and more emotional, because it showed the transformation of Michael&#39;s once innocent mind into a full-fledged Mafia don who will stop at nothing to maintain his empire. This film also brought audience into a great example of irony: Vito&#39;s establishment of his empire with love and respect, and Michael&#39;s succession full of shattered morality and paranoia. Francis Ford Coppola made a sequel that surpasses the brilliance of the original, a modern classic, and Pacino&#39;s greatest performance to date. 
Almost as good as the original!!!	Bulgaria	And that is saying a lot.Probably the most fantastic and well made sequel of all time.Some consider it to be even slightly better than the original but for me the first Godfather is still the best mainly because of Marlon Brando.Despite of that The Godfather part 2 is a flawless movie,a timeless masterpiece with countless qualities that crabs the viewer and never ceases to impress.Al Pacino delivers simply a stunning performance and deserved an Oscar for best actor.Here he isn&#39;t the fragile,insecure young man he was in the original film.Here he is wiser and more respectful.Perfect Michael Corleone.The rest of the cast is amazing too.Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and John Cazale as Fredo shine once again.Cazale as the treacherous Fredo has a bigger role and makes an even greater impact on the audience.But a lot of the credit has to go to the brilliantly cast Robert De Niro who indeed deserved to win the Oscar for best supporting role.His portrayal of the young Vito Corleone and his rise to power is simply stunning.Excellent work.Director Francis Ford Coppola is simply one of the greatest directors not only of his time but of all times and shows once again that he is the biggest fan of the novel and shows great respect both towards Mario Puzo and his work. 
even better than part 1	Germany	The Godfather Part 2 is easily better than part 1 for several reasons.<br><br>1. The telling of Con Coleones rise in power with Robert De Niro is very exciting and De Niro is amazing.<br><br>2. The scene where Micheals brother Fredo is killed is the best scene in the film.<br><br>3. I felt there was a bit more action but there was still time for story and character development.<br><br>4. The last scene with Micheal sitting on the bench is also very good.<br><br>5. The score is just as in Part 1 superb.<br><br>So all in all Part 2 is better than Part 1 which didn&#39;t really believe could be possible. 
A great sequel and enduring vision of corruption and family.	Wolves, England	Without a doubt, Coppola made four of the best films of the 70&#39;s. The Godfaher Part 1, Part 2, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. Out of these, The Godfather Part 2 remains my favourite.<br><br>It continues the Corleone family tale, of greed and corruption and yet Part 2 adds another vein to the bloodstream of this biblical tale; the story of Vito Corleone and his arrival in New York. The cinematographer, Gordon Willis creates a sepia-washed dream of a New York. Every shot is sumptuous ad full of depth - the production value was a help too, with some of the most authentic streets scenes ever committed to film.<br><br>Though, as wonderful as the film looks, the acting is stellar to. De Niro completely transforms himself from the urban maniacs like Johnny from Mean Streets and Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, to form Vito Corleone, the younger Marlon Brando. De Niro doesn&#39;t over cook the character, instead he simmers; his eyes tell two tales, one of being content, the other of contempt, for the killing of his family.<br><br>De Niro is backed up by great co-stars, such as Bruno Kirby who played the young Clemenza. The story itself in this section of the film is slow burning, much like the rest of the film, yet is here to serve a contrast to the story of Michael Corleone in Nevada.<br><br>This is the part in the trilogy where Michael transforms from the &quot;college boy&quot; and &quot;war hero&quot; of part 1, into the heartless, muted confusion that he embodies here. Pacino plays the part with ease and never goes wild and shout, much like his later work (Glengarry Glen Ross, Godfather Part 3...). Keaton is superb as the WASP wife, Kay, who tries to break free of the corruption she has married into. Cazale, who plays Fredo is wonderful too, a helpless, jealous character, who forms one of the best brother characters in film history. The co-stars are also great, with Strasberg as Hyman Roth.<br><br>Just as Michael&#39;s family is dissolving, Vito&#39;s is just beginning. The two fragments of the Corleone history run side by side to depict the downfall of Michael&#39;s character. Constantly trying to please his dead father, Michael talks of family, but doesn&#39;t understand how to sustain it.<br><br>A classic. 
Not just a sequel, but another masterpiece of a continuing story.	United States	The Godfather Part II, is just as good as the first film. Al Pacino was absolutely awesome in this film. His performance in this film is one of my personal favorites, and probably one of his best performances of all time. This film was so good because it continues the story of Don Michael Corleone's rise to the top, and then slowly to the bottom at the end. Plus another cool thing about the movie, is that it has several flash backs on the life of younge Vito Corleone, played by Robert DeNiro (who also gave a great performance). Again the directing, and story telling, and the acting were great in this movie. It is truly the greatest sequel of all time. 
One of the best sequels ever made	Milwaukee, WI	 An excellent follow up to the original, The Godfather Part II continues where the first film left off and explores the rise of Vito Corleone in a series of flashbacks that, for the most part, correlate with what is presently happening to Michael Corleone (Pacino) his son and successor. This is a beautifully produced piece of film, and while I still prefer the first installment, simply because of the story content, it is every bit as good.  This film is best when watched together with the first film &#150; if your body can stand it.  Even better, watch the third one as well for a little closure and so you can argue over whether it's a good film or not.  (I myself personally like the third film, but not as much as the first two.)<br><br>--Shelly 
Poor Fredo! We still miss John Cazale!	United States	The Godfather Part II has excellent writing, plotting, editing is even brilliant, acting, and overall quality to watch over again and again. You can never get sick of watching this film. I miss John Cazale. He was truly a gifted actor and I miss him. He played my favorite Corleone brother. Sure Alfredo was never brilliant or vicious but he was sweet, gentle, and warm most of the time. He had a conscience and I despise Michael for killing his own brother. I think he killed him out of jealousy. Alfredo spent more time with Michael's son, Anthony, than he did and he resented him for it. Alfredo could have been spared. Four years after Godfather Part II, John Cazale died of cancer after filming the Deer Hunter. He never won an Oscar or made too many films but he made every role memorable. Rest in Peace, John. I miss you. 
The best sequel ever	India	There are bound to be comparisons to &#x27;The Godfather&#x27;,but it definitely comes close to surpass its predecessor but to no avail.But that doesn&#x27;t take away any credit from another gem from Francis Ford Coppola.There would have definitely been immense pressure on Coppola to deliver the second time after the first one was a huge hit.<br><br>Robert De Niro was outstanding as the young Don Vito Corleone and truly deserved his Oscar.John Cazale delivers on getting more screen space.But I was disappointed to see that Al Pacino as Michael Corleone after having overshadowed his previous work in the first and having reached greater heights in this one, did not get an Academy award.<br><br>The film does not disappoint and matches the original in every aspect.Truly outstanding cinema.
