Soulless, anticlimactic, over-hyped and finally..not Batman!	Australia	The Dark Knight is the worst sequel since Highlander 2: The Quickening. I am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re-invigorated so wonderfully with Batman Begins. I speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it, ergo people dont like it. I really think this film is the biggest dupe since The Blair Witch Project. I want to make it clear that I love Batman, Bob Kanes Batman, Frank Millers Batman, Jeph Loebs Batman and the DC Animated Universes Batman. Like many, I found the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films excruciating to watch. Batman Begins came along and Christopher Nolan gave us a Batman we could respect and understand as well as believe. We were then teased with The Jokers calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen history....and we got....a joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist, no batcave, a batsuit that looked like a riot cop, a convoluted Scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime, a Two-Face whos only motive is a dead girlfriend, a Batman we hardly see, and a Gotham City that now looks like Chicago. But the enigma I cant stomach is that the film HAD NO CLIMAX!!! I asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each time...oh it was Batman confronting Dent...no it was the Joker hanging upside down, no it was Rachel Dawes being killed.....NO there was no climax! This films success lies only in the sad fact that its main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film. In Nolans attempt to legitimise the Batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring.	1
10/10 Is Absurd	United States	First let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star. My real rating would be a six to an eight (depending on your taste in movies) but I had to compensate.Compensate for what? Well, literary device, Im glad you asked. Toolsthe answer is tools. No, not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver. Im talking about people, people who are easily swayed by other peoples opinions and by mass marketing campaigns. Unfortunately, almost everyone in America (including myself) is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool. Now I realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots. If they have ever given The Dark Knight 10/10 stars or referred to it as one of/the greatest movies of all time well then Lil Miss Daisy Im afraid you have a huge tool on your hands. I recommend immediate euthanasia.Why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews, I simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. Its quite simple really. The media told everyone they should likeso they did. These people then went out and told their friends that they should like itso they did. And these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like itso they did. So it went until one day TDK topped the list of IMDbs greatest movies of all time. What it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage. Had the initial media coverage been negative and Heath Ledger (God rest his soul) not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for Hollywood this never would of happened. Basically what Im saying is someone told you this movie was good, so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws. And while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet I feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess. Too many people told you it was good. You went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws. This movies current average (9/10) is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified. Its an OK movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted.	1
Wow...	United States	Good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie??? Well, according to most people, I guess so. But for people like me (unfortunately there arent too many of us individual-minded thinkers left), it takes a good STORY to lure us in. To me, this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed... of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on. A way-overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what I got out of it. One thing after another made me feel like I was watching Batman: The Law  Order Miniseries. Oh yeah, for one of the best, if not the best movie of all time, this thing didnt leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable, likable story. Funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away lets see... the cinematography and special effects.	1
Fight Club for stupid people	NYC	Instead of questioning Capitalism, Communism, Taoism or Existentialism... and challenging the audience... it is about corruption and surrendering to corruption like surrendering to jaded teen boredom. Fueled by the claustrophobic helplessness due to terrorism, and the merciless acceptance of hipster nihilism, TDK is a cold unrealistic mechanical set-up sold over and over again by its proponents as ultra-realistic. That is the most frightening thing about the obsessive if not immoral blatherings of TDK fans is the Emperors New Clothes insistence that the film represents realism. From the Jokers precision timing to drive a school bus into a line of school buses, with one space left for him... to Dents facial damage due to 5 seconds of burning gasoline... the film is rife with movie fakeness sold like Ad (or ADD) pitchmen for Nolans formulaic realism, which is actually just him stealing from The Long Halloween.A meaningless Rube Goldberg contraption, Nolan takes the audience on an endless set of fake-out twists and turns to deliver very little but loud moments. As calculated and obsessive as The Joker is, and to the degree he plans about 5 separate back up plans that come to fruition, he enters the level of anal retentive... yet somehow we are to believe he is some agent of chaos. Which, means cool. Chaos = cool, get it? Theres nothing cool or chaotic about this drugged out riffing Joker, and as fun as Ledger makes him, he overshadows what should have been the center of the story: Harvey Dent. But its Batman so, business as usual... problem child villain acts up, makes a mess, BatDad shows up to clean up the mess. Crowd applauds. Unfortunately what the film creates is a subtext of a NeoCon wetdream with by any means necessary militarism, where the Batman uses unethical means to detect the Joker, and we are to assume this fall from grace makes him heroic because he is banished and falsely accused (for 1 minute of nagging by the Joker, turning Dent evil for yet another film coincidence) of driving Dent from white to dark knight... so Batman takes the blame and is the dark knight cuz hes just a Christ figure. So our sacrificial Justice League hero is supposed to be a sympathetic figure of crossing moral boundaries to save society... George Bush must have loved this puppy. Not sure half the tween tards watching this caught that bit of hooey, but as much as the poster art evokes Fight Club, this film is about as far from punk anarchy as you can get. Maybe they should all be sent to military school if this is their idea of rebellion.	1
Where is the story?	United States	After I was done watching this movie, I was sitting there waiting for it to begin. There was no story. There was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen. Unbearably trite performances all around. Can Morgan Freeman play anything other than Morgan Freeman? I was waiting for the scene when he tells Batman that he is really God and that Batman has to be God for a day, i.e. Batman Almighty.Were given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters. This was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects, explosions, and other eye candy. The only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing, but in that regard, it did not live up to Batman Begins. Nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove. The love is gone and its showing in a big way.The Batmobile was fun to watch, but that hardly makes a movie.Please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves. Make Nolan and other film-makers do more than throw gobs of money at ILM to make a movie.	1
Horrible	United States	This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you think that it will be as good a the original I urge you to never watch this. Heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not Oscar worthy, but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in Brokeback Mountain. The use of the Harvey character was pathetic and Christian Bale is one of the wost actors to ever play Batman. His Bruce Wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie, other than Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordan. The whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects. I would recommend watching the original batman with Michael Keaton any day. Dont waste your time with this crap written by Nolan, he is a hack. Unless you like Batman sounding like he is Satan... dont watch this film	1
Just four words	Sofia, Bulgaria	Ridiculously overrated, monumentally disappointing.Whoa, IMDb wont let me post this. Its too short, obviously.Well, then let me tell you this - I never cared for the re-franchising of Batman. Its just more of the Hollywood-style money making. And the more money they put into a film and its promotion, the more hype they create. But it sadly isnt just about them wanting us all to go see the movie. No, they get really greedy and after a certain point is reached, they proclaim this same movie is a piece of art.Its that simple. And if you can succeed in believing it is, it makes your life easier and jollier. You go to IMDb.com, you give it a 10, you read some exuberantly positive comments and smile contentedly, you read some unfavourable ones and mutter to yourself that there are always idiots who just dont get it, and youre happy, cause millions of people are desperately trying to prove to each other that they are part of something bigger than life, and are succeeding in that endeavour, and you are one of them.Not me, guys, not me. I like a lot of stupid films, but not this one. It makes me sick, for it reminds me how gullible we all are and just how much we want to dream. But we only want the dreams to come on the big screen - this is one of the many possible ways, kindly provided by our great benefactors, we can spend our ugly dollars on something shiny and new and inspiring, and harmless. And easy to digest.So, be happy, eat your popcorn, feel nice, eat well after the movie, sleep tight, dream beautifully, but dont bother trying to wake up, cause we are all in a really comfortable place and waking up will be very painful. On the other hand, the dream factory could keep you contented by offering you another piece of art for 10$ or thereabouts. Kudos to our benefactors and encore!	1
Its not really that great of a movie	Philadelphia, PA	Im so relieved that Im not the only one who doesnt think this movie is great. I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably wouldve given it a bit higher rating...if I wouldve reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesnt hold up as well outside of the movie theater with its huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and couldve done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie shouldve focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That wouldve been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasnt some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesnt emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I couldve lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. Theres really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, cmon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. Its just too much. Too many things going on that dont really gel together. I guess Im tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, Ill watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasnt any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesnt live up to the hype.	5
Dark and Dreary	None	Although an average film, Batman Begins had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolans dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make Batman Ends.	4
Gimme A Break	Canada	This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still cant say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldnt see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super heros outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldnt even move properly in it,(heck, he couldnt even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)Ill tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasnt. Disappointment? You betchaa!Long Live Jack Nicholson.	4
