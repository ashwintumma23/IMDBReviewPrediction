The Epitome of film Excellence.	Italy	I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And for generation after generation theres only one film that I will always give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. Its powerful in every way, that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is a great story with great characters.Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party whos a pro golfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy. Meeting the sisters  was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety, the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each others opinion for Andy had always been the hopeful dreamer and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy through his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.Its the best film Ive seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10.	10

A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic	10
Is this really the second best film ever made? *SPOILERS*	Canberra, Australia	The reason I am commenting on this film is that I saw that it is #2 in the IMDB top 250 films of all time. Why? It is a good movie, for sure, but there are so many movies that are far superior. Does it really deserve to be ABOVE Citizen Kane?The Shawshank Redemption is a great story, with fantastic performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, but it is also a conventional Hollywood movie and just doesn't venture into very deep waters.Stephen King creates great stories that hold the reader's interest throughout and are always exciting, whatever the genre. Yet he doesn't really make any very interesting insights into humanity. His characters are either good or evil; there is no in-between for him. That is not to say that his good characters cannot commit crimes or make mistakes, but the evil characters seem to have no motivation beyond just being, well, basically evil! For example, Clancy Brown's prison guard and Bob Gunton's warden are rather one-dimensional characters. Why do they exist? To make the protagonist's life a living hell. For no other reason.****SPOILERS BEGIN**** While Tim Robbin's prison escape makes you go woohoo and jump up and down in your chair, it's just not a very feasible plot development. I mean, come on, the guy is there for 20 years and NOBODY notices that he has dug a four foot hole through his wall? I don't usually have a problem with surrealism in films, but this is not a surreal film. It is otherwise realistic, so the escape scene just didn't sit right with me. ****SPOILERS END****Every scene is accompanied with trite music, so that we know when to be happy, when to be concerned, when to get teary-eyed. The cinematography is technically fine, but there's nothing new in that department. The villains are completely one dimensional characters with nearly no motivation except for their own sadism, and the film leaves no room for you to draw your own conclusions. Like in most Hollywood films, it is expected that the audience is basically stupid so we have to have it spelled out for us in the end. The movie goes on about ten minutes too long. I gave this movie an eight out of ten, because I love a good story and Tim Robbins is excellent as always, but it is not really the most original film of all time.There are several prison films which I would rate superior to this one. Among them, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Papillon, and Cool Hand Luke. See these first before you give this movie a ten out of ten.	8
Frankly, I dont get it	Seattle, WA	He that lives upon hope will die fasting. - Benjamin Franklin Frankly, I really dont get the praise for this film. It wouldnt even be in my Top 250. The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings. Well, that and Morgan Freemans calming voice. Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism, to be honest. Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like From Caligari to Hitler by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazis after World War I. There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination.	5
My favourite move of all time	United Kingdom	Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3 and go on to write what they really think, to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be, i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such, I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such.As for the movie, I cant tell you how incredible it is in my opinion, it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again, and not get tired of watching it, the cast was spot on everything was perfect, the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley, all of it was simply spot on, honestly speaking I dont know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is, well deserving of its number 1 spot on IMDb.Also I read that people dont understand how Andy pinned the pictures to his wall, it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie, Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of how he put the poster back up after entering the hole because the poster never gets taken down.	10
Now here is a classic	Nigeria	This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabonts screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didnt do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critics high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of Kings books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of Kings books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com	9
Masterful.	United Kingdom	***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film Institute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100 Years...100 Movies list. On this, The Shawshank Redemption was listed at #72. I find it it was ranked so low.The Shawshank Redemption is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of Kings works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery, The Green Mile, etc.) but The Shawshank Redemption outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who dont know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a banker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), the films narrator who has a reputation for being able to get things from the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the best of friends as the years go by, during which time Andys financial knowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt Warden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering operation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time in prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and maintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at the conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace through his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency that, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an excellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank Darabonts direction and Roger Deakins cinematography. While the characters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless trapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the dark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins lead performance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is delivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions are perfect in capturing the characters calm, laconic yet hopeful demeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and deserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His narration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience. Particularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof of why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and deserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics and viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabonts skill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freemans skills as actors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of filmmaking and is up there with The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. One of the greatest achievements in cinema in recent times.	10
I thought Id discovered this movie	United States	Id never heard of The Shawshank Redemption when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a sleeper, on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been Pulp Fiction and Heat. I didnt see Forrest Gump until around 2000 or so, and didnt care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that Ive gone back through), I suppose Shawshank will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making Hey, its not all that! (That is, its not all that good, its lousy, its overrated, etc.)Whatever, its a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for The Big Lebowski, which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now its a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like Rocky Horror once was. I saw Rocky Horror in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable.	10
Salvation	Canada	There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Reds hatred of hope, and Andys response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank.	10
awesome movie	india	awesome movie...the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb...one of my favorite movies...!!! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movies can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.	10
Shawashank Redemption astonishes me !!!	Kuwait	Ive heard of this movie before i saw it, to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue, man!!! when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute, its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the American cinemas history ... Id like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it, i give it up for their great effort that will last in every ones memory for his life time. Im sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me, I did my best to deliver what i think. Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.	10
Words are unable to talk about it!!!!	Kermanshah, Iran	2417th review!!!! Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothings found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever. The movie cant be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But Im hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because silence is full of unspoken words	10
Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies	India	I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed heroes. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freemans brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You dont need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a mans bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.	10
Hope never gives up on you	India	Belonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I normally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I always thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the Shawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie instantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter how dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the end of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning bright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all around you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if your light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that moment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down about anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to watch.	10
Review of The Shawshank Redemption	United States	What to say about the Shawshank Redemption? I shouldnt really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, The Shawshank Redemption remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect.	10
Redemptive Masterpiece; Masterful Redemption	Cieszyn, Poland	Despair or determination; crying or fighting; obedience or inner freedom; resignation or patience; fear or hope...difficult choices in life make us all more powerful human beings. Experience makes us richer; hardship makes us stronger, friendship makes us better. Although we may be deprived of everything, only our own choices may truly deprive us of human dignity... These words ring the bell for the majority of people; yet, seldom do they appear so unique, so real and so concrete as in this wonderful film...Based on the novella by Stephen King RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, the story appears to be unlike any other movie, unlike any other adaptation of Stephen Kings stories onto screen, unlike most productions of the world cinema. Why? I think that every viewer has to answer this question oneself. What I am going to do in this review is not look at why it is so powerful, why it is so unique but rather focus on a certain aspect that, in a way, refers to this question. What absorbed me to the very core of my emotions and feelings is the main plot of Andy (Tim Robbins), the banker wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to Shawshank prison where brutality and wretchedness really reign. At the spot where for many people, life actually ends, for Andy a new tedious struggle begins. Quickly befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), actually the narrator of the story, both soon prove that even in the worst circumstances, within the hell on earth they can maintain human dignity and strive on their own way to freedom...Here, let me refer to Roger Eberts words who nicely described the character of Andy: he says that Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Indeed, salvation lies within discipline for him...self-discipline...Except for some other plots, including the touching yet tragic story of Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) and of the sympathetic librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), it is Andy and Red who supply us with the most unforgettable moments in the movie. It is, as a matter of fact, the story of their friendship, their dreams expressed at the wall of despair. They maintain hope around themselves and within the viewers. Here, a very powerful aspect of Red is his narration...our thoughts are directed towards his thoughts, towards his reflections and his perception of the events, his - the prisoners. Swear words take on power to convey meanings and harshness becomes reality. Here, it is important to mention the inevitable brutality in the film. Thanks to the fact it is perceived by Red, it never appears to be unendurable or harmful for the emotions of the viewer. We, as observers, truly know what world we are led to...yet, there is no loss of hope!The unforgettable scenes seem to evoke the most powerful associations and expectations that lie within us concerning the visual and sensual experience. With Thomas Newmans terrific music score consisting of dark piano music, we are supplied with intense emotions and effective thrill. Except for the symbolic and almost cult scene when Andy escapes the prison (mind you the almost claustrophobic effect), one cannot skip The Letter Duet scene when the excerpt of Mozarts The Marriage of Figaro is being played. The prison life stops for a while being awestruck by the glimpse of harmony, by the blissful moment of magnificence. At this moment, I was breathless and really second the powerful line: Music makes you free! The performances are awesome and the depiction of characters is executed in an extraordinary way. There are no clichs which is a great merit of the film and where many films of the genre fall into that trap. Although there were many actors who had been cast for the role of Red, I think that no one would have done the job as well as Morgan Freeman. He is perfect in the role combining a certain quality of patience and distance with the emotional struggle for personal rights. Ironically, he portrays a re-socialized character...in fact, richer inside than any corrupted decency. Tim Robbins also does a terrific job as Andy with all his features mentioned before. And Bob Gunton as a true villain, the boss of this hell of Shawshank will long remain in memory.To sum it up, I agree with short but meaningful words said by Roger Ebert: THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a movie about time, patience and harmony... I would even add that it is the film about true life where people are really themselves, to the most extent themselves. There, within the harshest reality... Because only there, we truly behave according to our rules. There, we make choices even if everything that surrounds us seems to yell: Salvation lies within blind discipline and fundamental Bible! A redemptive masterpiece, a masterful redemption...desperate Brooks was here...and so was Red...yet, he brought a new dawn for dreams, a new dawn for friendship... Will he succeed?	10
A fantastic story which touches the inner-most of the body	Denmark	I felt a sudden need to create an account on the web. Why? I do not know. Having never written any movie review, I sometime wonder why I felt a need to use a regular Friday night doing so. But then I ask myself: Do there really have to be a purpose? Maybe not.The first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption were a couple of years ago. I had looked up the evenings TV program and I stumbled across the movie title. Not really expecting anything out from the films summary, I sat down on this evening and watched it. And did it move me. I was completely blown away by everything which the film contained: The acting, the environment, the music - and the story. The ladder plays an important role in the movie. Why? Because in short, the film is about a man who is wrongfully charged for murder, and the next many years in which he spends inside prison. But there is something more to it. The story is so well polished, constructed and so well told, that you wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching. Because really, it is all the details and the finesse of the movie, which takes the film to a higher level than any other film which are told through storytelling.Throughout the 130 minutes of the film, you will be witness to fantastic all around acting, particularly from Morgan Freeman who does a hell of a job working as the story teller. With the film starting out slowly, it smoothly starts to work towards the second half of the film, where the film really starts to touch your soul. The ending of the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best on film ever made, I dare say that.I could continue endlessly naming the goods of the film, but there is simply too much. In the end it is hard to point out what makes the Shawshank Redemption so much better than everything else which you have ever seen. My advice is: Buy the film and watch it - you will not be disappointed.I hope...	10
Shawshank Redemption- Prison Film is Redeemed by Quality ****	United States	An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good Forrest Gump.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences.	10
The best film ever made!	India	The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema! The Best Hollywood Film Of All-Time! A Masterpiece! A cult classic!

Morgan Freeman is masterful, his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby. Others are excellent.The Shawshank Redemption is cinema at its very best. My salute to this flick! A true Masterpiece! I just love this film! The most powerful film of all-time.	10

Stephen Kings prison tale with a happy ending...	U.S.A.	THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a kind of morality tale that is definitely one of Stephen Kings more restrained kind of stories, dealing mostly with a character study of two individuals sharing imprisonment and the consequences that await them when the tale ends.TIM ROBBINS is a man wrongly convicted of murder and serving a long prison term while MORGAN FREEMAN (who plays the narrator with great dignity) describes himself as the only guilty man in Shawshank. The hardships of prison life are captured in brief scenes that make the viewer wish that Robbins will find a way of escape. Along the way, he is gang raped by prisoners and treated harshly by a brutal warden and some of his spirit seems to vanish. But Robbins is quietly effective as a prisoner who makes a good adjustment when he takes charge of the prison library and sees to it that theres a wider selection of books than the kind of potboilers that King is noted for writing. A touch of irony here, no? The closing scenes are a bit of a stretch and a reminder of just who wrote this prison tale--but still, they make an impact because of all that happens before.Its a bittersweet story, a sort of horrific fairy-tale of what might have happened, but the viewer will be caught up in the story because of the tremendously skillful story-telling magic of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay.	7
A beautifully crafted tale that underlines subjects that have been forgotten in modern films- friendship,hope, freedom	United Kingdom	This film is a modern classic. Why? Because it simply includes everything which builds a great story, and that is all films really are, storytelling.The concept of story telling can very easily be lost and forgotten in an industry that can sell cinema tickets by using special effects and employing world super stars like Tom Cruise. That may well be the easy option, but films that rely on pretty faces and big budgets will never be remembered. It is films like Shawshank that will lodge themselves into people hearts, and will be passed down by many generations.This is because everyone that watches this film becomes a part of it. You are there, in that prison, suffering when Andy does, smiling when Andy does. Tim Robbins plays this part so well it could be classed in one of the best lead parts in a film ever. He is simply superb. Plus, Morgan Freeman, well, would we expect anything less from a man with such talent?It is this relationship, between Andy(Robbins) and Red(Freeman) which really strikes me as a breathe of fresh air, as if i had been hit in the face by a strong wind. We are trapped in a society where relationships only seem meaningful and deep when the two people involved are having sex. Hollywood have molded this preconception that characters with a relationship must sleep together. Shawshank, for once, tells the tale of two men, who by the end of the film have a very strong relationship, but have not gone down the Brokeback mountain road of madness. Their friendship is portrayed free of sex, yet is portrayed so powerfully that you are emotionally taken back by the ending. Personally i nearly cried at a friendship so pure yet so meaningful.The plot is also perfectly timed. I am someone that is usually quite critical if the speed of a film moves too fast or if it drags on. Shawshank gives you a mixture of paces, but also keeps the story turning and turning, as if it has a heart beat, pumping more and more of the story line, unwinding the plot before your open jaw.Another subject i would like to comment on is the swearing. Again, i am normally quite critical of films that have swearing in, just to look cool, or higher the rating. Swearing in that context seems unnatural, and therefore disjointed. However the swearing in Shawshank seemed totally natural, and all part of the atmosphere of the prison.Finally, i think everyone should see this film. This is a pure, yet thrilling tale of hope, friendship and belief. The story is executed brilliantly, with intense characteriztion from both sides of the spectrum- you become Andy, and go through his struggles with him, and you hate the warden and his captain with a passion.I guarantee, by the time those credits gracefully slide up the screen, you jaw will be open, your mind will be blown, and your heart will be broken into pieces. This is a truly unforgettable masterpiece.	10
Graceful, intriguing Tim Robbins triumph	United States	The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.	9
This Movie Saved My Life.	United States	I have been a fan of this movie for a long time.It seems that ever time my life hits a downward spiral, I can always seem to pop this movie in, and come up with a solution to my pending problem. It somehow gives Me sense of peace and inner strength.So, It wasn't all that strange for me to pop it in when I was going through a rough patch in my marriage. I found myself identifying with many of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a mistake that had been made early on in their lives. This film gave me the strength to escape from my world of misery. And now I am able to say I, Like Andy broke out of my own personal Shawshank.My Ex isn't too happy about the divorce. But life is much better now. And I feel saved from a life of unhappiness, Due to a mistake of a marriage to early in life.Thank You Frank Durabont.Your film saved my life.	9
Interpersonal Communication Use	Merced, California	I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course.  The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language, powerful and powerless speech, posture, intimate and social distances, territory, chronemics, various types of listening, and self disclosure.  Many young students struggle to relate in-class/in-text examples to their own lives, and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication.  ALWAYS a good experience for my students!	8
Better Late Then Never	Baltimore, Maryland USA	Along with Q and Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont (The Walking Dead original writer) and his debut film got screwed by the Hollywood Powerhouse that is Tom Hanks with this now can be considered an American Classic. The fact that this film barely and I emphasize barely made its money back in US theaters (which is usually a signal for a film to turn into a DOA when released at home) and it made such a splash, that the film is exceeding what anyone thought a simple 18 years ago. This includes some of Hollywoods best critics including EWs Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late 94. Yet over time, this story of redemption, like the rise of hope this film gives from beginning to end, grows on you to the point where at the very end, you have no choice but to clap (I clapped in my basement in front of my parents and I havent looked the same since). Darabont found a formula that worked and it shows in his future films. He made Robbins human, made Morgan Freemans voice as American as a Big Mac and made the late great Rita Hayworth relevant again. The only regret that one should have is the fact that if it was released two years later it wouldve swept away the Oscars (Sorry Ralph Fiennes, The English Patient won on a weak year.)	10
So its not everyday that you watch the greatest movie of your lifetime.	Australia	I will always remember the night I watched this movie for the first time. I was 16-years-old and my dad and I were pretty bored late on a school night. So naturally I say to my father, Dad, I think its time to watch Shawshank. I almost regret watching it. It is that good. Its like nothing I ever see in my lifetime can ever compare to the emotional roller coaster that The Shawshank Redemption takes you on.First question I usually ask people when discussing films is, So have you seen Shawshank?. No matter what their reply is I am happy with the outcome because if they say no, then they are yet to see the greatest movie of all time. If they say yes, I have something to talk to them about for the next 27 minutes.You probably still wont believe me when I tell you that this is the greatest film you will ever see. Its that good that I actually told one of my friends not to watch it until she was on her deathbed. Then she will see this movie without ever having to compare anything else to it. Now when I see a movie all I think is, Ive already seen the best.Now actually getting onto maybe even reviewing this masterpiece (not that any summary of the plot could ever do it justice). So all I will say is this, I have never heard anyone give this movie a bad review. Do yourself a favour and dont even bother to finish reading this. Just go and watch it.	10
Blatantly Simple, yet Utterly Beautiful	United Kingdom	To tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in fact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat action, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so closely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the harmonica used just before Reds finding of the letter close to the end). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is a beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect, Morgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be. Highly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age- !judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I cant say it deserved its nO.1 position, i cant say any movie does, but if any movie should, this one might as well be it. *********	10
Very powerful	Romania	I feel sorry for all of you , guys/girls who rated this as 1 star (awful). I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen. Maybe it is overrated, maybe not , but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top 250. This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if you loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give it a 5. I read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying :  ... it is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star because I think it is very overrated ...  Thats so pathetic ...Once again , STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it !	9
