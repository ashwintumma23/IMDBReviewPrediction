The Epitome of film Excellence.	Italy	I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And for generation after generation theres only one film that I will always give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. Its powerful in every way, that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is a great story with great characters.Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party whos a pro golfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy. Meeting the sisters  was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety, the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each others opinion for Andy had always been the hopeful dreamer and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy through his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.Its the best film Ive seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10.	10

Is this really the second best film ever made? *SPOILERS*	Canberra, Australia	The reason I am commenting on this film is that I saw that it is #2 in the IMDB top 250 films of all time. Why? It is a good movie, for sure, but there are so many movies that are far superior. Does it really deserve to be ABOVE Citizen Kane?The Shawshank Redemption is a great story, with fantastic performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, but it is also a conventional Hollywood movie and just doesn't venture into very deep waters.Stephen King creates great stories that hold the reader's interest throughout and are always exciting, whatever the genre. Yet he doesn't really make any very interesting insights into humanity. His characters are either good or evil; there is no in-between for him. That is not to say that his good characters cannot commit crimes or make mistakes, but the evil characters seem to have no motivation beyond just being, well, basically evil! For example, Clancy Brown's prison guard and Bob Gunton's warden are rather one-dimensional characters. Why do they exist? To make the protagonist's life a living hell. For no other reason.****SPOILERS BEGIN**** While Tim Robbin's prison escape makes you go woohoo and jump up and down in your chair, it's just not a very feasible plot development. I mean, come on, the guy is there for 20 years and NOBODY notices that he has dug a four foot hole through his wall? I don't usually have a problem with surrealism in films, but this is not a surreal film. It is otherwise realistic, so the escape scene just didn't sit right with me. ****SPOILERS END****Every scene is accompanied with trite music, so that we know when to be happy, when to be concerned, when to get teary-eyed. The cinematography is technically fine, but there's nothing new in that department. The villains are completely one dimensional characters with nearly no motivation except for their own sadism, and the film leaves no room for you to draw your own conclusions. Like in most Hollywood films, it is expected that the audience is basically stupid so we have to have it spelled out for us in the end. The movie goes on about ten minutes too long. I gave this movie an eight out of ten, because I love a good story and Tim Robbins is excellent as always, but it is not really the most original film of all time.There are several prison films which I would rate superior to this one. Among them, Kiss of the Spider Woman, Papillon, and Cool Hand Luke. See these first before you give this movie a ten out of ten.	8
Frankly, I dont get it	Seattle, WA	He that lives upon hope will die fasting. - Benjamin Franklin Frankly, I really dont get the praise for this film. It wouldnt even be in my Top 250. The only thing my spouse has been able to glean from researching the topic on the internet is that psychologically people seem to like the film more and more upon repeated viewings. Well, that and Morgan Freemans calming voice. Not that challenging cinematically and a bit of a fantasy that pawns itself off as gritty realism, to be honest. Not to be an alarmist, but part of me wonders whether this film would be Exhibit A should the country ever descend into a fascist dictatorship much like From Caligari to Hitler by Siegfried Kracauer examined German film during the rise of the Nazis after World War I. There is something going on on a group psychology level here that bears examination.	5
My favourite move of all time	United Kingdom	Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3 and go on to write what they really think, to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be, i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such, I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such.As for the movie, I cant tell you how incredible it is in my opinion, it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again, and not get tired of watching it, the cast was spot on everything was perfect, the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley, all of it was simply spot on, honestly speaking I dont know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is, well deserving of its number 1 spot on IMDb.Also I read that people dont understand how Andy pinned the pictures to his wall, it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie, Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of how he put the poster back up after entering the hole because the poster never gets taken down.	10
Now here is a classic	Nigeria	This suspense filled, dramatic movie rides high on the plain of self discovery, self worth and self preservation; if an innocent man is locked up for two decades with criminals, nothing else will he learn than to be a criminal himself. There is no better movie that I can recommend you to see than this classic Jail Break that stared one of the best supporting actors you will love to have on your side if you are in the lead role of a movie, Morgan Freeman.Shawshank Redemption was adapted from a Stephen King novella named Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Frank Darabont secured the right to make the film from King in 1987, and he worked intensively on the screenplay for a proper adaptation of the movie, Darabonts screenplay writing earned him an Academy Award nomination, in fact the movie had seven Academy Award nominations and won none.The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker who got convicted for murdering his wife and her lover; he got two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. At Shawshank Andy befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) Red was a contraband smuggler.Andy also developed a nice rapport with the warden and the other guards helping them with their taxes and also helping the warden in his money laundering operation.The movie boast of amazing scenery not to add an impressive cinematography, the movie growth and inclusion and exit of characters will make you feel like you are reading a book, the movie has numerous cast, and it is broken into segments each introducing new casts and each building a parallel wall that guides us to the climatic end.It didnt do well in the box office at all barely making back its production cost, but due to critics high rating and Academy Award nomination, Golden Globe award nomination and other notable nominations, the movie did well in rental and DVD sales, it is shown regularly on Cable TV, and it has a high following.Frank Darabont who is the director and screenplay writer also made more of Kings books; He directed the 1999 Tom Hanks movie The Green Mile which was a box office success compared to this. The Green Mile is another of Kings books that is about a prison, and Darabont also directed the 2007 movie The Mist which is also based on a Stephen King book.Here is a DVD every home should have.www.lagsreviews.com	9
Masterful.	United Kingdom	***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film Institute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100 Years...100 Movies list. On this, The Shawshank Redemption was listed at #72. I find it it was ranked so low.The Shawshank Redemption is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of Kings works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery, The Green Mile, etc.) but The Shawshank Redemption outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who dont know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a banker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding (Morgan Freeman), the films narrator who has a reputation for being able to get things from the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the best of friends as the years go by, during which time Andys financial knowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt Warden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering operation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time in prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and maintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at the conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace through his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency that, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an excellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank Darabonts direction and Roger Deakins cinematography. While the characters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless trapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the dark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins lead performance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is delivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions are perfect in capturing the characters calm, laconic yet hopeful demeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and deserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His narration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience. Particularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof of why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and deserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics and viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabonts skill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freemans skills as actors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of filmmaking and is up there with The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Casablanca and Gone with the Wind. One of the greatest achievements in cinema in recent times.	10
I thought Id discovered this movie	United States	Id never heard of The Shawshank Redemption when I tuned in to it about 15 minutes in on one of my satellite channels, sometime around 1997 or so.It mesmerized me, and the last 20 minutes astounded me. The twists, the musical score, the final scene. Amazing.I recall doing some searches (in those pre-Google days, probably with Alta Vista) to find out if anyone else had ever heard of this film. I found out that they had. It turns out a whole lot of people discovered this film as a sleeper, on DVD or cable or satellite.My favorite movies of around that time, seen in theaters, had been Pulp Fiction and Heat. I didnt see Forrest Gump until around 2000 or so, and didnt care for it much. A good year for films.Given the comments in the past half year or so (that Ive gone back through), I suppose Shawshank will fall below some other films. There seems to be a a trend toward making Hey, its not all that! (That is, its not all that good, its lousy, its overrated, etc.)Whatever, its a great film. And when I happened to see it late one night on my satellite system, I thought I was the first to realize how great it was. It took several years for me to spot the high ratings on IMDb and to read that it had become a cult classic favorite.(Ditto for The Big Lebowski, which for a while I thought I was the only fan of. Now its a subject of festivals and midnight watchings, sort of like Rocky Horror once was. I saw Rocky Horror in 1976 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City and thought it was not very entertaining.)For me, the last 20-30 minutes is just the best. One twist after another, all seamlessly done. And a compelling musical score. Unforgettable.	10
Salvation	Canada	There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Reds hatred of hope, and Andys response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank.	10
