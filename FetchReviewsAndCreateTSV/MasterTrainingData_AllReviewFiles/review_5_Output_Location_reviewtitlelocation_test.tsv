Not the classic that the critics say	Chicago	I saw this movie on video, after hearing all sorts of movie critics praising Tarantino's masterful use of multiple narratives in this film.  I suppose I was expecting something along the lines of Rashomon, which was probably setting my expectations too high.  There are three story lines (two and a half really--the Tim Roth-Amanda Plummer story is not sufficiently developed), only one of which is really interesting: the final story, revolving around Bruce Willis.  And that story takes up maybe one-quarter of the movie.  The remainder is filled with the John Travolta-Uma Thurman story line, which would have been interesting in the hands of a more talented writer or director than Tarantino.  The most interesting character is Keitel's--a great movie could be made of him, but he is on screen for only about ten minutes.  Tarantino does a nice job of exploring the banality of evil, but the hard-boiled dialogue is more often artificial and embarrassing, and when he runs out of expletives, he resorts to violence. As for the multiple story line concept, it's wasted here.  Tarantino actually did a better job with interweaving multiple story lines in Reservoir Dogs (another flawed film, but for different reasons).  And regarding what's in the briefcase--ultimately, who cares?	6
Jaw dropping	United States	Quentin Tarantino takes you on one wild ride in this movie with the out there dialogue, the violence, the music, the drugs, the dancing and the 50s themed diner! The overall message of this spectacle in my opinion is that eventually you have to come down,whether it is from the high of blowing people away, from snorting heroin and over dosing and getting a shot of adrenaline in your heart to going back into a dangerous situation to do the right thing even when you want to run away. This movie is fast paced, laugh at loud funny at times and sometimes blush worthy but most importantly it is unforgettable. This is a modern classic that should not be missed.	8
Masterpiece	Canada	I first saw Pulp Fiction around 2009. I must have been 14. Little did I know this movie would grab me in a way no other has. Im normally not the type to re-watch a movie less then a year apart, but within a month I had already seen Pulp Fiction twice and by the end of the year I had probably seen it about 7 times. Over the years Ive seen it at least an additional 15 times now, often showing to friends who havent seen it and It still never gets tiring to watch. Tarantinos brilliance is still unparalleled today. The dialogue is the likes of which no movie has come to match since. Pulp Fiction is a timeless movie that never gets boring no matter how many times you see it.	10
gangsters thriller	None	Known as a gangsters bizarre thriller, pulp fiction was directed by Quentin Tarantino and released in the year 1994. Starring Uma Thurman as Mia Wallace, and John Travolta (Vincent Vega) and Samuel L. Jackson (Jules Winnfield) as two criminals, this film won two Oscars and cost 8 million dollars. Jules and Vincent work for their mafia boss Marcellus Wallace. He is dealing with Butch Collidge, a boxer who failed to lose a fight on purpose after taking Wallaces money and is now planning to leave the city, but he cant because he lost his fathers watch. Vincent faces some problems when Wallace asks him to take his wife Mia out for a good time while hes away. The movie is presented in a series of chapters where the lives of unrelated people are put together in funny and black comedy events. The ending is very much unexpected. Pulp fiction was a 90s classics and the best gangsters thriller Ive ever seen. The performance of the actors is amazing, the script is brilliant and the music is excellent. This film appeals to an audience of over fifteen who love thrillers.	10
Perfection Fiction	United States	This is perfect storytelling, acting... An instant classic : an homage to B movies of the golden age and very modern in his conception at the same time. Samuel Jackson plays Tarantinos screenplay like a music instrument, John Travolta seems to be back from the dead, Harvey Keitel is hilarious, Uma Thurmans part is so moving, Bruce Willis is so badass, Maria de Medeiros so cute... Every songs of the soundtrack are unforgettable. Each frame absolutely gorgeous... Tarantino is a genius and his love for cinema explodes everywhere in this movie. With Wild at Heart by David Lynch, its one of the greatest rocknroll Palme dOr in movie history. If you havent see it yet,how lucky you are !	10
Great Movie	None	Great Movie I recommend it to everyone who hasnt seen this film. Its filled with action, suspense and terrific drama. Great for fans who love 1970s film. Sam Jackson, John Travolta and the cast did a great job is selling their characters. Tarantino, the director had the worst performance of the cast. He should stick to directing. The end of the film was special. I dont want to give it away but to end with the start of the film was creative and I bet this concept will be copied by upcoming directors for years to come. This movie will live forever and will be considered a classic. classic story telling, great dialogue and unexpected drama and action. Go see it! But be warned, you will be spoiled. You will expect all movies to be this good.	10
review	United States	Pulp Fiction is just one of those movies that you always hear about but maybe have never seen. This movie is so different and interesting, director Quentin Tarantino really made a breakthrough film with this one. the camera angles were a really big appeal to me when watching this movie. The over the shoulder shots, as well as camera shots that were point of view shots, were very interesting. The camera was often angled down low and tilted slightly in many scenes which added a cool twist to the average eye level filming we see. The diverse cast of so many well known actors worked so well together to create a film as interesting and different as this one.	10

Easily one of the best films of cinematic history	United States	Quentin Tarantino has taken a spot as one of the best and most influential directors of all time. Two years after his success with his debut film Reservoir Dogs, he took his director skills up to next level in this 1994 black comedy Pulp Fiction. This film boasts a strong ensemble cast of actors including Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, Harvey Keital, Uma Therman, Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Maria De Medeiros, and Eric Stoltz. Told in a nonlinear prospective, the plot follows the separate lives of their characters and how their lives untold in events that lead to their fate. The movie mixes elements of violence, humor, and satire, creating one of the most memorable and quotable movies of all time.John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play two mobsters, who acquire a briefcase containing a secret item, and are assigned to protect it for their boss Marcellus Wallace (played by Ving Rhames) while facing troubles along the way. Travolta and Jackson put on some mesmerizing performances and showed incredible chemistry between each other. These two were probably the best characters of the whole film. Bruce Willis plays a professional boxer, who is caught up in a kidnapping plot while obtaining a watch from his father. Uma Therman plays the wife of Marcellus Wallace, who is invited on a date with John Travoltas character, only to face a serious dilemma involving heroin. This part includes one of the most shocking scenes where John Travolta makes an unprofessional attempt to save her condition. Then there is Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, who play a Bonnie and Clyde-like couple, who rob a local restaurant with unexpected circumstances. Director Quentin Tarantino also has memorable cameo in one scene with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.The most memorable aspects of this film is not only clever dialogue and Tarantinos unique style of cinematography, but also how amazingly well the characters are written. Quentin Tarantino did a great job at giving each character proper construction. This film is packed with a number of characters, but does well on making sure you remember each and every one of them. While the plot is a bit scattered-shot, the film manages to be entertaining in every way. Pulp Fiction is not only Quentin Tarantinos best film, but also one of the greatest films in the history of cinema.	10
A Masterpiece	Liverpool	The film that perpetuated Tarantino to an icon in the history of cinema is without question this one. Pulp fiction is written in such a way that even though it isnt filled with wall-to-wall action it glues the audiences eyes on the screen from beginning to end thanks to its snapping, self-referential dialogue, layered engaging characters and at the time revolutionary form of storytelling. The film focuses around several plot lines all of which somewhat connected in their own Shakespearian way, and of course the mysterious contents of the briefcase. Another strong feature in the film is the stellar performances from Jon Travolta, Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman (all of which were nominated for academy awards as a result) who brought their A-game to the set, each delivering famous, ultra-quotable phrases throughout the film. Yes Pulp fiction is a timeless classic that will live on throughout film history.	10
