To call it a sequel is a travesty	None	This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.	10
The Greatest Film Ever Made	Canada	The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (Keep your friends close ....., I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent.	10
One of the Best Sequels Ever	Canada, ontario	You can count on one hand the movie sequels that measure up to the original; GODFATHER II makes the cut. This movie is just as fine as GODFATHER I. Here the director goes back and forth between the early days of the young Vito Corleone, played by Robert De Niro, and the family after the action in GODFATHER I in the 1950's just before Castro came to power. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has moved the family and most of his business to Nevada. Once again the acting is flawless. Diane Keaton as Michael's wife who quickly becomes disillusioned with her life with him and the lies he continues to tell her, assuring her that he is going legitimate soon; Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted brother and adviser; and Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth all give outstanding performances; but the film really is Al Pacino's. We see him become a ruthless, cold-blooded killer who alienates himself from his family in ways his father would never have done. He has come so far from the idealistic young man in GODFATHER I, who joined the Marines in World War I to serve his country and die for it if necessary, to a lonely, paranoid tragic man. There are many poignant scenes concerning his wife and children-- the drawing his son leaves for him in his bedroom, the gift that Tom buys the child because Michael is too busy, his wife Kay's being kept a virtual prisoner at his orders in the family compound, etc.Once again many acts of violence are interwoven with religion: Michael's son's first communion, the religious parade in New York, Fredo's repeating the Rosary in order to catch a fish, for example. The cinematography is stunning; the footage from Sicily and New York around the turn of the century and the snow scenes from the American West are beautiful and rich in detail. Mr. Coppola has directed yet another masterpiece.	10
Great ensemble acting, great story, greatest sequel ever made.	Derbyshire, UK	The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see.	10
Breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur...	Mexico	Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by The Godfather, Part II in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters...	10
The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made, one of the greatest films of all time and possibly finer than its superb predecessor *****	United Kingdom	The Godfather Part II (1974)Number 1 - 1974Top 3 - 1970sMy father taught me many things. Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closerThe Godfather Part II is truly a masterpiece. Timeless, Classic, Beautiful and endlessly watchableThe second part of Francis Ford Coppolas Epic and violent Gangster Trilogy, follows the reign of Don Michael Corleone as the head of the Corleone family. As well the film shows us the early years of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and respect. Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part II exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy Award winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro. The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made. This is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppolas second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part. As close to perfection as movies getPacino at his best-10/10-	10
Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under sprawl	New York City	Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) in the role of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the inside was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended flashback segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call J.K. Rowling Syndrome. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the d&eacute;nouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.	9
A Masterpiece	United States	The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part of this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I was very surprised by this. The story is amazing, everything makes perfect sense. The Oscar winning screenplay is amazing, the dialogue is some of the most original, and realistic ever putt on screen, the characters are flawless, and it's in every way perfectly written. The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless.	10
One of the greatest sequels ever made	United States	After seeing The Godfather and improving it as one of my favorite films, I wanted to get more into The Godfather so I rented this. Words can't describe how great this sequel was. The acting once again was amazing and the story and how the movie went on just never got me bored. Everything in this movie was clearly beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more. You have to see this movie because it's just brilliant filmaking. It's not better than it's first film but still an extremely worth sequel.10/10	10
A Hollywood Masterpiece!!!!	USA	Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, The Godfather.  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb.	9
The Greatest Sequel During  the Cinema's History	United States	The Godfather, Part II is excellent just like its predecessor. While the first is arguably the greatest film ever made, the second installment is easily the best sequel produced hands down. The film is split between the stories of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, Oscar-nominated) and a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in his star-making, first Oscar-winning performance). In the 1950s, Michael is trying to expand his crime empire to locales such as Las Vegas, Hollywood, and even turbulent Cuba. However, there are numerous problems as older brother Fredo (John Cazale) may have double-crossed the family. Also two prominent crime bosses pose a considerable threat as well (Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo, both Oscar-nominated). Younger sister Connie (Oscar nominee Talia Shire) is still reeling from her husband's murder and her father's death at the conclusion of the original film. Michael is also distancing himself from his wife (Diane Keaton) and some of his most trusted friends (Robert Duvall). While all this is occurring we get glimpses into the early life of Michael's father (De Niro). We learn that his parents and older brother have been killed in early-1900s Sicily and that he has immigrated to New York. Vito pays his dues and learns the tricks of the trade, buying his time, before deciding to create his own small empire which would of course grow and become what we saw in the original. It would seem that the film would be confusing by jumping back and forth between Michael and his father, but that is not so. Coppola gives you just enough information to keep the audience intrigued through each segment. The film is very well-made and runs very smoothly even though it lasts over 200 minutes. Many think that this installment is the best of the series. Even though I still think that the original is the best, I cannot totally disagree with this assertion as this is the definitive sequel. 5 stars out of 5.	7
An Insult To Call It A Sequel	Queens, New York	To me and probably to many other people The Godfather Part II is more of a continuation than sequel to The Godfather. Just look at the IMDb rating and youll see Im not the only one who feels this way. To me it as good as the first.The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original.The directing once again is perfect. Francis Ford Coppola know or at least knew how to make a movie. The first to Godfather movie are done so precisely and perfectly that nothing really sticks out because they are so perfect throughout. Coppola just lets his actors play everything out as he should with type of cast he has here. Not to many movies can maintain such a consistent flow over 3 hours let alone even an hour and 45 minutes.The writing may not have been quite as good as the first in terms of quoting but the storyline was perfect. Seeing the decisions made by new mob boss Michael Corleone was common sense but flashing back on Vito Corleones life was genius. The storyline to me could not have been better and Coppola and Puzo do a great job with it all the way.Like the first the cinematography was amazing but it had a slightly different tone to it. The first had more of a majestic, mythical look to it. In Part II you feel the modern times creeping in and the Corleones having to adjust to it. Part II has more of a corrupt and evil twist to it but I guess the end signifies that. The music obviously the same as the first was perfect and just fit so greatly with the rest of the movie.The first to movies of The Godfather series are really like the same movie. They are not the same though, they are actually very different but the greatness of them both and the continuation of the storyline from the first to the second really create a strong band between each other. To me it is only a sequel in that it was the second movie of a great series. No let downs, no disappointments just a continuation of of the greatness from the first one.	10
Terrific continuation of the Godfather series; to call it a sequel almost seems insulting...	UK	This sequel is just as terrific as the first film, if not more so. I hesitate to call it a sequel, as sequel is quite simply the wrong word I am looking for. A film like The Matrix Reloaded is a sequel - The Godfather Part II is something more. It's just too good to be called a sequel.The film won six Oscars in 1974, including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro). It deserved every one. It involves the viewer from the start and never lets up. Particular aspects I enjoy in this film are the flashbacks to Don Vito Corleone as a child immigrating to New York City after social problems in his homeland, Sicily. I like the intertwining of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), his son, in present day, dealing with his crime inheritance, and Vito (Robert De Niro), his father, years ago. I like how, as Michael comes to terms with his family legacy, the film shows us Vito coming to terms with his future. The day he shoots that man in a gritty apartment complex is a turning point in his life. Every actor is in top form here. Al Pacino has gradually made the move from a man who denies his future to a man who is accepting it. His character is the spotlight of this film, much more so than in the first film (though both center around his decisions).Robert De Niro is particularly wonderful and convincing as a young Vito Corleone, who was of course played by the constantly-spoofed Marlon Brando in the original. De Niro takes an iron grip on his character and completely engulfs himself; this was, in 1974, the sign of an actor who would go places. Indeed, he did.Coppola's magical sense of direction is at work here, as is the script by Coppola and Mario Puzo (whose novels the series is based upon). The original was a wonderful film, but the sequel presents more of a challenge. Flashbacks are often intercut in the middle of other films are awkward times, but in The Godfather Part II, Coppola uses them at precisely the right moments, managing to careen in and out of scenes and time periods with free abandon.It takes a great kind of skill to master something like this, much less a sequel to one of the most beloved films of all time. The Godfather was an instant classic upon its release in 1972. Coppola had two years to plan for his continuation of the film. People told him it wouldn't work, he would never beat the original, and he would never pull it off. But he showed them all. The Godfather Part II may well be the best sequel I have ever seen in my entire lifetime. I wish they were all this good. To call it a sequel almost seems insulting.	10
About as good as the first one, but mainly because of De Niro	Denmark	It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10	10
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: The Godfather of all sequels	India	The Godfather Part II is a consummation of the saga of the Corleone Crime family. Regarded by many as the best sequel ever, the Godfather Part II is equally brilliant as its precursor and good enough to stand on its own. The movie juxtaposes, the early life of Vito Corleone (from his orphaned childhood to his rise in power in New York), with the life of his son, Michael (after Vitos death to Michael becoming the most powerful Mafia head). Al Pacino picks up from where he left in the first part, consummating Michaels journey to the dark side and in the process, presenting him as the greatest anti-hero, the western cinema ever embodied. The movie gave Pacino his third consecutive Oscar nomination and a perpetual stardom that catapulted him above the ruck, laying the foundations of his illustrious career. Just like in part I, his performance in this movie is absolutely worthy of an Oscar, but the Academy once again robbed him of the glory.Robert De Niro in his Oscar winning portrayal of Vito Corleone, gives a great performance without uttering a single word in English. The synergy imparted by the brilliance of these two outstanding performers, makes the movie, a treat to watch. Robert Duvall reprises his role of Tom Hagen with a desired degree of subtlety and equanimity, reminding the viewer of Brandos portrayal in Godfather part I. The entire cast is brilliant with special mention of John Cazole as Fredo, Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth and Michael V.Gazzo as Frankie Pentageli, who are outstanding, to say the least. Cuppolas brilliant and innovative direction gives Puzos masterful story, an incredible impetus, which is well complemented by Nino Rotas poignant score and Gordon Willis vivid cinematography. In a nutshell, the movie, though sanguinary and lengthy than its precursor, is an equally brilliant work of cinema, a profound and a deeply engrossing master piece.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/	10
As good as the original...	Canada	Sequel to the original Godfather is slower moving than the original but maybe better. The first was fresh material and Brandos presence was a huge plus. But this one digs into the blood and guts of the two main characters, provoking more thought, as well as introducing us to one of the most prolific actors today.Michaels descent into darkness is terrible to behold. Tragedy surrounds him as he struggles to maintain his empire but alienates himself in the process. Hey, its not easy holding a crime empire together. I think this film sets out to make Michael a tragic figure but how do you feel sympathy for a guy who murders family members? Its a cold world obviously, and takes a strong man to stay on top. Very interesting final scene, grim and stark, as Michael sits contemplating on a chair watching the dead leaves blow around him.Pacinos performance is magnificent. Some great scenes, especially when Michael realizes Fredo betrayed him. That simple movement of covering his forehead in shock and despair conveys so much. Michael becomes a three dimensional character in this film as opposed to the first. Pacino just nails the part.The secondary story is the rise of Michaels father, Vito Corleone and we watch the birth of a star. DeNiro even surpasses Pacino in his part, if that is possible. The calculating Vito as he calmly stalks Don Fanucci from the rooftops is classic film. DeNiro plays the role of Death himself: knife thin, pale yet slick and immaculate in appearance. How many other hit men in the movies borrowed DeNiros look? What the Godfather does, unlike so many other films of its generation is convey thought in simple movements. Watch DeNiro as he pales visibly, staring at an old Italian remedy of his sick baby. We know right then that Vito Corleone will do whatever it takes to protect and save his family. Watch him as Don Fanucci boards his car and leans on him. By DeNiros expression, we know Fanucci is already a dead man. Thats unsurpassed acting.The sets are beautiful to behold and this is probably the best cinematography I have seen in any movie. Early 1900s New York, in the Italian neighborhood is unreal. Watch the pedestrians and background movement while the focus of the scene is occurring. Thats sheer magic. Once again, watch Hyman Roth in Cuba lie on the couch, shirtless and a gentle wind moving the drapes. We can practically feel the heat and hear and smell the city of Havana. It made me think how much care and calculation was put into this movie.Some weak points: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth was not on par with the other actors. Gazzo as Pentangeli just grated on my nerves, especially in the first hour. I was hoping he would get whacked so he would not appear in the rest of the film. The rest of the cast is great as usual, especially Duvall and Kirby. Not much to complain about.The second Godfather, tries to do what the first does, a study of Vito vs. Michael. They both have different motivations for ruling their empire. Whereas Vito tries to do whatever it takes to rise from poverty and provide for his family out of love, Michael rules out of ruthlessness and a need to succeed to maintain his empire. You can see where the results have taken both.One of the greatest films of all time.	9
Sorry, but it just didnt deliver	Mexico	OK. Lets get real. The Godfather is beyond excellent in every single way. Im not giving comments on The Godfather, because it would be almost blasphemy. Nevertheless, I expected much more on part II. Personally, I didnt like it. Heres the deal: the story was way too slow paced. Nothing really happened. Only the hit on Michaels house, and the build up for young Vitos story was what makes you interested. The rest is just anti-climatic and dull. The dialogs werent as quotable or stand alone as in the first. I thought as a sad imitation of the real thing.Al Pacinos performance was absolutely superb. The problem wasnt that. The whole character was what failed. In the first, we get the glimpse of a warm man, but gets cold when is needed. A man who thinks before he talks. In this one, we see a man who is cold and heartless every single time you see him. He no longer has the eminence that Vito Corleone once had. The previous Don was eminent and even though he could scare the hell out of you with his stare, you respected and looked up to him. Now, his son is just pure evil. And that doesnt make sense. In the book, its clear that Michael is the living image of his father. So, what happened? Him killing Fredo was completely useless. Even if he did betray him, there was no need to have him whacked. A Don just doesnt kill anyone from his own family (not the Family, the real one). I know, Michael did kill Carlo, but lets remember he was not really family, just an in-law, and he did deserve what was coming. Another thing I personally hated was what happened to Connie. As you will see in the third, she radically changes from the naive Dons daughter to... Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, all the other aspects, (filmmaking, score, performances, photography)were indeed flawless. Its interesting. You can perfectly notice Coppolas anatomy for each Godfather. You start with a prologue, then a religious ceremony and/or a party afterward, the plot then starts and a pivotal point is a hit on the Don. The rest is a slow, yet properly thought vengeance that ends with a gigantic and operatic blood bath. However, for part II, it wasnts that operatic or with the same effect than part I. It was anti-climatic, and pretty disappointing.Another flaw I found was that the story doesnt really stick to the book. One key aspect in the film didnt even appear in Mario Puzos novel: Vito Corleone never returned to Sicily. The name of the Don who had his family killed doesnt even matter. Still, the scene prominently explains Don Tomassinos condition from the first.Now, dont get me wrong. Im a die hard fan of The Godfather. I consider it to be the best movie ever (and the best novel ever, too). But part II just doesnt do it for me.	5
A decent follow-up but not great as far as  Im concerned	Canada	The Godfather: Part II hit theatres a couple of years after the first film and made history by becoming the first sequel to win the Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it is routinely listed alongside the original as one of the best American films of all time.The story picks up a few years after the end of the first film. Michael is firmly established as the head of the family and has moved to Nevada where he is edging the family towards legitimacy. However, when he is beset by betrayals he systematically sets about dealing with the betrayers mercilessly. There is also a second story thread (told in flashback) that traces the early years of Vito Corleone and his introduction to mob life.The film clocks in at a hefty 200 minutes. Unlike the first film, though, I couldnt really get caught up in either of the parallel stories so the film seemed to drag quite a bit. I didnt find the Vito storyline particularly compelling and the Michael storyline is little more than a convoluted extension of part one. These stories were meant to be compared but I dont feel that the director or the editor really constructed the film optimally for this purpose. Nevertheless, the film still has a classic scene or two, though its nowhere near as consistent as the first film.Most of the actors whose characters survived the first film reprised their roles here. Returnees Al Pacino  Talia Shire each landed Oscar nominations and so did newcomers Michael V. Gazzo  Lee Strasberg. However, the only actor to take home an Oscar statuette was Robert De Niro for his portrayal of the young Vito Corleone. Personally, I think that Pacino gave the best performance of the film.Francis Ford Coppola won an Oscar for his direction but I feel that the first film was a better effort. From a visual standpoint the film is attractive, though, and the Nino Rota score was justly rewarded with an Oscar.Ultimately, I dont feel that The Godfather: Part II lives up to its pedigree. Ive watched it a few times, so Id say that Ive given it a fair shake. That being said, I realize that Im in the vast minority here so it must be a personal thing. As far as Im concerned, Chinatown deserves the Best Picture Oscar that went to this film.	7
Not Far Behind The First Film	United States	This isnt quite as powerful as the first Godfather, done two years earlier, but it isnt far behind. Its another magnificently filmed effort, wonderfully acted and a hard film to stop once youve put it in your tape or DVD player.What makes this a notch below the first Godfather is the absence of Marlon Brando and a little too much disjointedness with flashbacks. Also missing from this film was the volatile James Caan. He was shown in a flashback scene near the end, and that was it.One thing was just as good if not better than the first film, and that was the cinematography. The browns, blacks, greens and yellows are just great treats for the eyes. I especially love the Italian houses and scenery. Why this was not even nominated for an Academy Award in cinematography is mind-boggling.The story centers around the brutal vengeance of youngest brother Michael (Al Pacino). It also gives a good demonstration of how the gangster lifestyle may look attractive on the outside but really is an unhappy one despite the wealth.There are some excellent supporting performances in this film, too. I especially would cite the roles played by Michael Gazzo and Lee Strassburg.	9
Overwritten Script Takes Away from What Could-Have-Been	United States	The sequel to The Godfather, at times, was just as impressive, and sometimes even more impressive than the original. Overall, though the film struggles with its flashbacks to an early New York as we watch a young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro), rise to power. The Godfather II, wants to be both a prequel and sequel at the same time. When were in the present time watching Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) fight off Senators that are trying to squeeze him, or when were watching his house get shot up on an assassination attempt that involved someone very close to the family we always find our self in amazement. When we jump back in time, you get a feeling of intrusion. The script is to blame because its too bloated, and wants to accomplish so much in its near three hour run time. When were in the early 1920s we see things that are entertaining and gratifying, but ultimately not even close to being on par with the present day status of the Corleone family. Its good to know and see how the godfather started out, but theres too much to say and not enough time to say it. The bloated section of the film becomes underwritten. We dont really learn anything about Vito Corleone that we didnt already know. We dont really see how he gains his power. He kills The Black Hand, and one day, through rumors, he becomes the Don of the city. Just like that. Just like that? Really? Then we come back and hes all of a sudden in the Olive Oil business. We dont know how he got there or anything, hes just there. De Niro gives it his best, but hes just not working with anything to give any kind of performance thats remotely on the same level as Brando did in the previous film. I found it painful to watch De Niro try to imitate Brando. When we see the city, it does have a good look to it, and its convincing as the set and costumes designs, along with the art direction, are very good. We never see big wide shots of the city block. We see a lot of people and grocery stores go by the quickly moving camera. Coppola does an excellent job of not pulling back too far (Probably didnt have the budget to make a huge set of the city), but we get a claustrophobic sensation. The kind of claustrophobic sensation where a guy right next door, in the next building, is close enough to stick his head out the window, call for you, and hand you a sack full of guns. Coppola encapsulates the city, and the time very well. There are some great moments in the flashbacks, but I could have lived without it entirely, and probably would have watched a much better film (Possibly better than the original). When Michael finds that his own brother, Fredo (John Cazel), knew about the assassination attempt on his life, and that he was involved and that he never told Michael about his connection with Hymen Roth and Johnny Ola, it infuriates Michael to the point of no return. He feels as though he loses his family. When he confronts Fredo, he doesnt say much; hes sick of him; Fredos too stupid to have around, and he cant even look at him. Coppola direction here is magnificent. Even though its dark and you cant see the reactions of both of the men, theyre both in the picture with the light shinning through the windows creating silhouettes of the men that were, and we see their body language, and the body language tells us everything we need to know.Cazel gives a great performance throughout the entire film, and we wish we got to see more from his character. Hes so good in this one scene that it stands as one of the best scenes in film history, and a huge part of that is due to him. The words that come out of his mouth are on par with Marlon Brando speech in, On the Waterfront. All this frustration, years of it, just boil over to point of pity. Hes pleading with his brother. We watch him spill his guts on the table, and admit that hes well aware of being stupid and feeding into that stereotype as he watches his younger brother give him orders we feel his pain and frustration for not living up to the coldness and callousness of his family. He feels like an outsider, a coward, and a loser. All the while, Michael sits in front of the window looking at the boathouse. He doesnt care what Fredo has to say, which makes it all that more painful to watch for the both of them. Michael wants information from him, and thats it. One feels like an outsider, and one is an outsider. Neither of them fit in this lifestyle, but it ruins both of their lives. Fredo wants respect and power. Michael has the power, but no respect, and finds out that he loses everything that he ever cared about: his family. Its one of the most powerful scenes in cinematic history.	9
It had nothing to do with business	Ruritania	In the movies, sequels have always been difficult. The franchise pictures of the twenties and thirties were always careful to repeat cast and basic formula without reopening story lines that had already run their course. While the following decades saw the rise of the TV series, the screen sequel became almost unknown. Today the fad of numbered sequels, ubiquitous in the eighties, has now become synonymous with unspeakable badness. That tradition was started, quite innocently, by this 1974 follow-up to The Godfather.Being a drama, The Godfather Part IIs biggest asset is probably in retaining the sublime cast that made the original so powerful. Al Pacino picks up exactly where he left off a few years previously, retreating further into passive steeliness, suppressing all emotions except the occasional burst of anger. John Cazale has a somewhat expanded role, getting to show off a more impressive acting range and making Fredo seem sympathetic in his weakness. Welcome returns are also made by Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Talia Shire. However the greatest turn is that of newcomer Robert De Niro. De Niro gives a credible presentation of an up-and-coming mobster and proud family man, whilst cleverly working in mannerisms of Marlon Brandos middle-aged Don in The Godfather. Its still only a small demonstration of De Niros talents however.Perhaps an even more important factor is the return of producer-director Francis Ford Coppola. Coppola demonstrates again his ability to focus drama, going to lengths to show us only what is important. Take, as one example out of many, the scene where Pacino and Lee Strasberg first meet. Roths wife greets Pacino, and bustles in and out of the scene once or twice to utter a few lines, but watch the way Coppola keeps her fluttering about in the foreground, often with her back to us, framed from the shoulder down so we never see her face. Coppola allows her to appear for reasons of logic, but as shes not a character we need to remember, he doesnt allow us to connect with her visually. This is really intelligent filmmaking.But The Godfather Part II is more than ever about stunning imagery. With a bigger budget, vaster sets and hordes of extras, Coppola shows an impressive ability to create thriving tableaux of crowds and street scenes, repeatedly using horizontal scans to move us through an environment, showing off a hundred tiny instances of real life that really make us believe in the recreation of a bygone era. This is especially true in the young Vito flashbacks, which thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and the production design team lead by Dean Tavoularis, have a wonderful sepia-toned look to them. Its intriguing how Coppola also tends to keep his camera further back from the action in the those scenes, giving us the impression of something we are looking in on rather than something we are in the midst of.And yet this concentration on the visual has perhaps been taken a little too far. There are too many rather blatant bits of symbolism, such as the business of the dividing up of the Cuba-cake, which reminds me of some kind of twee history textbook illustration. This inconsequential prop gets several amount of close-ups, and even several references in the dialogue, everything but a flashing subtitle saying Theyre carving up Cuba  geddit? But instead of looking clever it just seems silly to have Hyman Roth going on about his stupid cake. And whats more, there are too many references to the best ideas in The Godfather  the dark Lake Tahoe office where Michael does his dealings: the murderous little montage at the end  all of which serve little purpose other than sly winks to those who are familiar with the earlier picture. None of these motifs is executed as effectively as they were first time round, and so really they look almost like poor copycats by some lesser filmmakers. The Godfather Part II is in many ways a decent work, but compared to its illustrious predecessor it is lukewarm; a flawed attempt to rekindle some of the old magic. In fact, it is just what we have come to associate with the movie sequel.	7
Godfather II Stunk	United States	Godfather Two is Coppolas movie---and he had no instincts for the mafia. The Godfather author, Mario Puzo, objected to having Michael kill his own brother, but finally gave in to keep his share of the Hollywood millions.Godfather Two has lightweights as heavies: the drunken New York mob guy and Hyman Roth cant compare to Barzini, Sollozo, and the other heavyweight bad guys of the original Godfather written by Puzo.Godfather Two loses the atmosphere of the mob while it meanders lengthily into Cuba.The main point that makes Godfather Two inferior is that it does not contain a single sympathetic character.The endless scenes in the Lake Tahoe home of Michaels are tiresome, dreary after a while, and lack interest as compared to the original Puzo story.This movie shows a deterioration from the original, just as the mob has deteriorated in recent years.Coppola had no right to think he could write his own Godfather, and his inferiority to Puzo when it comes to dealing with the mob shows up here in technicolor.Meanwhile, poor Mario Puzo watched his story being degraded by the instinctless Coppola, objected at first, and then gave in. Pathetic.The only scenes that actually ring true here are from the original Puzo book (the earlier life of Vito Corleone).The contrast between the dreary Coppola script of Godfather Two and its dreary characters is brought home strongly by the final (flashback) scene where Sonny Corleone and the others are around the table. As soon as Sonny appears, everything comes to life.	4
A few historic flaws, but one of the best glimpses into turn-of-century NYC	New York City, NY	What else can be said about The Godfather series? One small gripe: The storyline shows young Vito Corleone (Robert Deniro) murder the local boss, then basically take control of the neighborhood. Historically, there would have been a dozen other guys in line to take the bosss spot -- young Vito, with no real connections outside of his petty thief neighbor, would have been disposed of immediately. In real life, bosses were bred into the position or it was taken hostilely from the inside. By the era that this movie portrays, Sicilian black handers and Neapolitan Camorra (among others) were fairly organized -- But, hey, its a (great) movie :)	8
In Some Ways Even Better Than the First One...	United States	Seven years after the first film, Michael Corelone (Al Pacino) continues his familys quest to become legitimate. Also, more on his fathers growing up in Sicily and coming to America. With Vito being played not by Marlon Brando, but Robert DeNiro.) If you liked the first film, you will like this film. If you didnt, you wont. Its really that simple, since you have all the same great people coming together for this film with just as solid a script and acting as you did the first time. You lose Marlon Brando, but you get Robert DeNiro. I consider that a fair trade.This film has two things going for it: it has the early years of Don Corleone, which really fills in the missing mythos around the family. Without this, the film would appear to show the Corelones were always powerful, which is far from the truth. It does not explain how Don Corelone grew to talk in such a mumbled voice, though.Also, I really enjoyed the entire Cuba sequence, because it put the film in a historical time frame (and I like Cuba). I was never fully sure when the first film was taking place, but this one made sure I knew the years when Don Coreleone was growing up and that the present day was not 1974, but rather in roughly 1958-1959. That changed my perspective on things completely.If you have invested three hours in the first film, invest three more in this one. Why only get half the story of Vito Corleone? I cannot make any suggestions for part three, though, one way or the other.	9
I really think this is the greatest movie ever made...	New Zealand	Wow. This thing is almost three and a half hours long and yet it is not boring for a second. Not one moment. From the very first scenes up until the tragic and forlorn ending, this film seizes hold of the viewers consciousness and does not ever loosen its grip, even when the credits roll. I walked away from the movie with what felt like a deep resonance inside me. It is at once heart-wrenchingly sad and stunningly beautiful.Thematically, it actually shares much in common with later films such as American Beauty and Fight Club. The Godfather Part 2 is the story of a man who seems to have it all - but the only things he ends up not having are the only things that truly matter to him. Michaels character arc continues on from the first film, creating a great, epic tragedy and what I think is one of the saddest and yet most majestic endings in film.I havent even talked about the more technical aspects yet. This is because I dont have to - everything is perfect. Not just great, but perfect, as in there seems to be no way that they could be improved on. Acting, direction, cinematography, script and story. Everything.The one thing, though, that clinches it for me is that the plot doesnt really matter. This is a movie about themes and ideas. The plot is quite thick, so dont worry if you dont get it - you dont have to. As long as you understand what the film is really about... you will walk away knowing that you have witnessed something almost life-changing.	10
The Greatest Movie the World has Ever Seen...	India	I personally think that this film surpassed the glory of The Godfather I. you will have to watch it time and again in order to understand the nuances of its brilliant film-making. the characterizations are exceptional: 1. Micheal Corleone (as the new don torn between family & business) 2. Hyman Roth (as the scheming old villain) 3. Kay Adams Corleone (as the worried wife) 4. Robert Duvall (as the loyal lawyer) 5. John Cazale (as the betraying brother) 6. Robert DeNiro (as young Vito) etc. etc.... Its just Brilliant!!! Speaking about the film-making the parallel narration of two different but interlinked stories is a fresh new lease of screenplay. the cinematography is outstanding. the indoors are lit up beautifully with overhead lighting which puts a shadow over the characters eyes making it impossible to say what theyre thinking. But unlike the first part where they had broken all the rules (the characters are established first before the place and time) in this film theyve come back to the rules (the locations are established before the characters) Francis Ford Coppola should definitely be given another chance to make a sequel to the trio-logy so that the present generation can also experience the Magic of the Movie and for anyone whos not seen this film, I bet theyre surely missing something in life...	10
The Godfather: Part II	Seattle, WA	Its not easy to be a son, Fredo. Its not easy. Is undeniably the best sequel ever made and one of the best films ever made. First off, Robert De Niros performance as the young Don Corleone completely owns. Pure genius, pure craft.Secondly, well its Pacino, all Pacino. One pure example, at its best is when Diane Keatons character confesses to him  it wasnt a miscarriage revealing that instead she had an abortion, so that she wouldnt bring him anymore sons into the world. Watch Pacinos face during this entire scene!!!!!!!! Or the last flashback scene where Michael reveals that he has joined the Marines to the disgust of his family and such, at this time he had his own  dreams now, we simply watch the price which Michael Corleone has paid himself for power.	9
Astonishingly unapproachable, bored me to tears	None	I have been forced to watch the Godfather trilogy by a friend of mine who thinks, as do most people, that they are the best thing since sliced bread. I found The Godfather just about watchable, but no more - I would have given up if my friend hadnt been there, but this was completely intolerable. I couldnt follow who the people were (and didnt care) I couldnt relate it to the previous film. I couldnt relate the 1930s stuff to the 1950s stuff. There is no excitement no tension, no nothing. A complete waste of an evening. And its so interminably long too. Im having trouble filling out my ten lines for the review, because the film left almost no impression on me - except that feeling that I used to get at school when I was forced to sit through the most boring lesson in the world. And God help me, Im going to have to watch the third one. Like taking cod-liver oil. Ugh.	8
Best Supporting Actor - Robert De Niro	London, England	After the success of 'The Godfather' and having been turned down for a part in the first film, Robert De Niro follows hot on the heels of Al Pacino by being cast as the younger version of Vito (Marlon Brando). In it, we see a 30 year old Robert De Niro being taken from being a clean cut young man, probably not as striking as Pacino with his large brown eyes and dark hair, but interesting to look at none the less. Although not innocent looking, De Niro goes from being clean cut to being the gangster that we have come to know and love in the 80's and 90's at the guiding hand of Francis Ford Coppola. No wonder he won the award for 'Best Supporting Actor' to Pacino's leading role. As a whole, the film wasn't as cinematic as the first one, the range of characters that dominated the predecessor was not there is this follow up. However, the film was dominated by Robert De Niro, and it's almost a pity that De Niro and Pacino didn't meet. They would have to wait until 22 years later when they would team up in 'Heat'.	7
Tremendous follow up to The godfather though Brando is missed	India	Part II in The Godfather saga carries on in much the same vein though Marlon Brando is sorely missed. The plot has Al Pacino exerting complete dominance as mafia boss in the fifties. The film also depicts young Vito Corleones (Robert De Niro) early years. This segment is slightly nostalgic but superbly acted by De Niro who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. As a result of the film moving both backwards and forwards in time, it feels more convoluted than the first part. Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton both impress. The shocking climax (MINOR SPOILERS) mirrors the ending of the first film. Highly recommended.Overall 9/10	6
The perfect sequel	London, UK	The accepted wisdom about sequels is that they tend to be less good than their predecessor as there is no story left to tell. The second Godfather is an embarrassment of riches in as much as there are two stories; the back-story of Vito Corleones arrival in America and that of Michael making good his grip on the inherited business.All the fine film-making that made the first so rich has been replicated and improved in this most handsome movie. Again we begin with a great set-piece (a Catholic confirmation) as a swarming expository melange of character and situation but which takes its rather more sober tone from the films prologue, telling of Vitos flight to America. The familial infections that poison this particular, warped Italin-American dream are doubly intense given that Michael is now the capo - where the threats of the first came from without, now there is danger within.Pacinos performance is first-class, never once resting on the laurels of his previous Oscar nomination. He is matched across the board by the rest of ensemble; Diane Keaton, Duvall and the twitchy Cazale are fine, and Ive always been a fan of Talia Shire whose performance as the Michaels widowed sister is a magnificent, discreet study in intractable sororial bitterness and love. A deeply sad and violent movie but one which never rules out the possibility of sympathy or redemption. An awesome achievement. 9/10	9
As good as the original!	None	I remember saying in my review of The Godfather that i was going to review this film a week later, that was more than one week ago thats for sure. I did actually start watching The Godfather Part II the next Friday, though i stopped watching after an hour because i wasnt really in the mood for it! So i decided that today, with nothing else to do, id give it another try and i wasnt disappointed! It was a great film, lots of talking but its still great fun to watch. I only have one criticism, the length. It was extremely long, about 3 and a half hours! But thats my only criticism, everything else was spot on! Hopefully ill be watching The Godfather Part III soon and as soon as i do, ill post my opinion right here! So overall, The Godfather Part II is just as good as the original Godfather If you havent seen this film yet, watch it now!9/10	8
Great Movie. Another Winner from Francis Ford Copolla	United States	Warning! Spoilers Ahead!The Godfather, Part II is another gem of a movie, worthy of a place alongside its revered predecessor. This movies strengths lie in Copollas retention of the best actors from the first film mixed in with terrific new actors for the second. John Cazale, Lee Strasberg, Robert de Niro and Michael Gazzo are given their moment to shine here, and play credible and unforgettable characters. Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Robert Duvall reprise their roles from the first movie, and put in an equal amount of effort to the first film, which means that the second is also very good. Copolla had a lot more creative freedom with this picture, but it doesnt differ much from the first in terms of style and camera angles. Still, the director does an admirable job crafting an interesting and wonderful film.Pacinos Michael Corleone is, in the first, a quiet and understated character most of the time, only this time, whenever the character is riled by a tragic event, Pacino lets out his infamous scream to emphasize that his character is like a dangerous time bomb with an unpredictable temper: one minute hes calm, the next hes in a rage. Unfortunately, Pacino is most remembered for his loud, bombastic performances rather than his understated quiet ones. Keaton appears to have less screen time, but, like her husband Michael, undergoes a credible transformation from the naive, submissive character we remember from Part I into an assertive, strong woman who will not give in to her husband. She asserts control over her own body by aborting her baby rather than letting Michael have another heir to his criminal empire. Again, Keatons performance is usually cited as the weakest of the Godfather saga, but this seems unfair, and she does well whenever she has screen time. Robert Duvall is back with another excellent turn as Corelone family adviser Tom Hagen.The new faces do very well here, and again, Copolla was blessed with an excellent cast. Gazzo is simply delectable as mobster Frank Pentangeli, one of cinemas most memorable characters. One minute hes a lovable old man, sometimes seeming as dopey and sweet as your great-uncle, asking the band to play an Italian tarantella; the next hes viciously asking for the blood of the Rosato Borthers. He, ultimately, cows to Michaels control during a Senate hearing, just as he is about to rat him out.Gazzo, a prolific playwright, showed he had the chops as an actor as well. Another memorable performance is the Italian actor who played the gangster Don Fanucci, a dandy tyrant who shakes down Italian immigrants for protection money. He, like the guy who played The Turk Solozzo in Part I, is a convincing actor who can make a slimy villain come to life. He seems to relish his role as the white coated mobster who confidently rules the neighborhood with an iron fist. Less potent is Lee Strasbergs Hyman Roth, who, after Don Fanucci, is the films main antagonist. Roths true evil is only revealed in other characters dialogue and indirect screen action rather than anything we see Roth do on the screen. I wasnt fully convinced that Roth was a cunning double-crosser, as we dont actually see him engage in the double-cross. Strasberg gives an understated performance as the kingpin of the pre-Castro Havana casinos (an obvious representation of real-life gangster Meyer Lansky). Still, Strasberg does have some memorable moments, such as the famous This is the Business Weve Chosen speech he gives to Michael.Fresh performances from John Cazale and Robert de Niro round out this movie. We dont see much of Fredo in Part I, but hes essential to Part II. Cazale gives a memorable performance as the meek, weak, sweet, but ultimately treacherous middle brother of the Corleone family. His flaws include his lack of intelligence and possible naivet&eacute;, which ultimately result in his being a pawn in Roths scheme to kill Michael. Fredo wants the keys to the kingdom, but will settle for some power, and Roth apparently offered him something special for his services. All Fredo says is that there was something in it for me!, but what this was is rather vague; still, Fredos ties with Roth are enough for Michael to commit the darkest murder he will commit in the saga: fratricide. We almost feel sorry for Fredo as he sweetly tells his nephew how to catch a fish by reciting a Hail Mary, right before Michael has one his goons shoot him from behind on a fishing trip. Fredo may be the rather weak and dopey member of the Corleone clan, but Cazale also manages to humanize Fredo and make a memorable performance as the ultimately tragic odd man out in the family business. Part II carries with it a sadder tragedy than Part I, as Michael loses his family, in terms of his wifes abortion and departure, and Fredos treachery and his eventual murder. It is in Part II that we see the full scope of the perils of a life of crime in terms of keeping a family together. Even Don Vito, while running a criminal empire, was able to somehow keep his family glued together. We see the sad irony when Michaels mother tells him you will never lose your family. This is an excellent movie, much like the first one. Copolla does well here. (Copollas further career is debatable. Radio host Phil Hendrie once gave a hilarious criticism of Copollas career: what do you mean Charlie dont surf?!) He directs beautifully here, and the actors cooperate by giving excellent performances. This is a highly recommended movie.	9
Parts of the Book That Were Left Out in Part One...	United States	...are included in Part II. This movie gives you the backstory of Vito Corleones rise to power, from the time his father is murdered in Sicily until he makes his bones and creates his own empire in the United States. Robert DeNiro is very convincing as young Vito Corleone in what was, if memory serves correctly, is his big screen debut. I was almost convinced he was somehow related to Marlon Brando, he had the voice, the looks, the mannerisms, everything. Couple this with another story not included in the book of betrayal within the family while Michael tries to make a move in pre-Castro Cuba and you have a sequel that is every bit as good as the original. Michael has been stripped of all his humanity in this story, and he comes across as being a cold and heartless human being, one who would even have his own brother killed to preserve his nefarious empire. The ending is heartbreaking because he realizes that he lost his family trying to save it. And the soundtrack in this movie is even better than the original GODFATHER soundtrack. For the third time, Im going to give a perfect 10 to this movie.	8
Best movie I have ever seen	United States	I got the privilege to watch this film for the first last a few days ago. This has to be my favorite film of all time, along with one of the best films that I have ever seen.The movie does very well in shown two different two stories in one movie. You have Michaels story of which shows his struggle in controlling one of the most powerful crime families in the United States. The second story is Vito Corleones struggle as young boy in Sicily growing up and coming to America, and his start of the Corleone crime family.This is a long film to watch, it took me a few days to watch it, as I watched about 30 to 40 minutes at a time.All of the actor and actresses preformed there roles very well, and the actors and actresses who got Oscars for their roles in this movie were VERY WELL deserved. Robert De Niro does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in film, in my opinion one of the best actors in 1974.The script is well written and for the most part is easy to follow.If you seen the first film, which is a must to understand this film, then you will like the second one, which is one of the best films of	9
One of the best films of all time	Canada	The Godfather II, in my opinion, is just as good as the first. So rare is it for a sequel to be as gripping and as well-made as this movie is. First off, I have to mention the excellent musical score. It gives the film a sort of dark, moody atmosphere, and I think it was a very good idea to use the same score as in part I. Secondly, the idea of inter wining the story of Michael Corleone and of his early father Vito was brilliant and makes this sequel stand out from the first part. This idea of showing two stories in one film could have been quite risky and confusing but Coppola did a fantastic job at it. Both stories are very clear to follow and show the contrast between Vito and his sons way of handling the family business.Of course, I cannot comment on this movie without mentioning Al Pacinos awesome performance. He definitely should have won the best actors Oscar for that role. He has unbelievable screen presence and plays incredibly well the ruthless, suspicious Michael Corleone. The most poignant scene of the film, in my opinion, is definitely the one where Michael finds out at the party that his brother Fredo betrayed him.	6
The Economics of Destiny	London, UK	Sequels rarely rise to the level of the original, and almost never surpass them. This phrase has been used so often in reference to The Godfather: Part II  the exception that makes the rule. What is even more laudable is the fact that the original is generally considered as a landmark in the history of film.This is one film that proves cinema to be a form of art, and not merely one of entertainment. A skilful direction from Francis Ford Coppola, outstanding performances from the likes of Pacino, De Niro, Gazzo, Strasberg, Cazale, Duvall, Keaton, Shire, memorable cinematography from Willis, a soundtrack by Rota, Coppola and Curet Alonso, and an ingenious script by Coppola and Puzo (partly adapted from his novel), make The Godfather: Part II stand out as a story of courage, love, treachery, and devotion, crafted in the life of the Corleone saga.The plot follows the consolidation of power of Michael Corleone, and his desire to gain the legality of his business, and the consolidation of power of a young Vito Corleone, and his desire to build a better life for his family. The old story of the father handing his wealth to his sons, gains a new twist by allowing a positive outcome to the original story. The wealth remains in the family, but there are losses to be incurred. An ontological thesis of Pareto optimality into the organisation of social structures is subtly brought into the view, without harming the general development of the story.The Godfather: Part II remains also as a text book for any actor. Al Pacino shows that temperance can be dramatic, making us empathise with his character even when made to realise the most brutal of actions.  Robert De Niro is purely outstanding, in one of the best supporting performances the screen has witnessed. His charm, charisma, and vocal skills, help him achieve a complete transition to Puzo's Vito Corleone. The viewer is unarmed in the choice given between murder and love, between life and necessity. Talia Shire stands out as the lost woman in a world dominated by men.Even if The Godfather is the point of reference when it comes to great cinema, The Godfather: Part II remains a powerful example which proves that there is always more to say in a story, and the additions can be more than surprising.	7
prefer the deniro flashbacks	usa	someone made the comment that he didn't understand why the flashbacks to don corleone's rise to power (with de niro as don vito) were included, that it romanticized the Mob.  i think the reason that we have the 2 stories is that they parallel each other.  while we are seeing how michael corleone is developing as a mob boss and as a man, and what forces are shaping him, we also see the same things in his father's early life - how don vito reacted to events, how he made plans and how he became the man he was.  although both men lived a life of crime the difference in the two is striking and real - don vito worked his way out of poverty and immigration and tried to help his fellow italians in a way that seemed to work for him.  don vito never lost his sense of caring for people in general and that they depended on him.he never lost his love for his family.  he never lost the common touch, the things that would endear a man to a community and win their loyalty.  when we look at michael in his criminal growth we see he becomes a completely different man - cold, ruthless, uncaring and increasingly isolated both from his family and from the greater community.  don vito actually served, however wrongfully, a purpose in his community and did some good - he provided political and financial assistance, and a basic justice to many people who would have been denied it otherwise.  michael corleone however is just a nasty, vicious, unfeeling, opportunist who does not have the same human touch his father did. and i think that is the main revelation of the 2 movies and why we have the flashbacks.  frankly i prefer the first movie, and the flashbacks in the 2nd movie - don vito was a better man.	8
Hate Michael by the end.	Alexandria, Virginia	By the end of this classic sequel to The Godfather, I absolutely felt nothing but hatred for Michael Chorleone.  Even though he waited until his mother faded off to kill Fredo, I still couldn't feel anything for Mike. But when you see the last shot of the film, you realize that he is going to regret it for as long as he lives and will fall into a deep depression for the next decade or so.  How could he be so mad at Fredo for being tricked by those two rats, Hyman Roth and Johnny Ola. That wasn't exactly all Fredo's fault. But, you not only do you feel the neglect from Michael to Fredo, but you feel the neglect from Michael to his family and household.  That was one of the really haunting parts of the film.  Michael's neglect is what causes him to fall into the deep depression by the end of the film and into the third installment of the trilogy.  Francis Ford Coppola has a true gift in film making and to this day remains one of the best directors in the business. The best of the trilogy.10/10 The best film ever made. *****/*****	6
Touching perfection...	Greece	Francis Ford Coppola directs the sequel of The Godfather the The Godfather: Part II. The Godfather: Part II is a movie that show us the history of Corleone family and also show us how Vito Corleone attempts to expand the family business into Las Vegas, Hollywood and Cuba.In this movie you will see an another perfect performance by Al Pacino as Michael Corleone (nominated for Oscar as Best Actor in a Leading Role) and Robert De Niro as Vito Corleone (won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role). An another good performance made by Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. The Godfather: Part II is a really good movie but is a little lower than the first movie that explains my title Touching perfection..., but it continues to be the best sequel of all times.	9
Travesty abounds.	United States	The Godfather: Part II is not a sequel in the traditional Hollywood sense, rather a companion piece to one of the greatest films ever made in The Godfather. Here, the story is epic and sprawling, as it covers Michaels reign as the new head of the Corleone family by moving the business to Nevada and at the same time flashes back to show the story of how a young Vito Corleone came to power and started the story now being continued.Francis Ford Coppola returns to his old ground with writing partner Mario Puzo to expand on Michael and establish Vito and doing so by going back and forth. This leads to some incredible shots of the young Vito and the young Michael in the same frame, a haunting image and symbol of how far this family has come. It also shows how far Coppola has come in terms of directing these films. Once again, his direction is immaculate in every sense, perfectly balancing the time between Michael and Vito, always picking the right time to go from story to story.All this aside, I havent even mentioned the other strong points, which are basically all of them. The flawless acting continues here with Al Pacino cementing his legacy in this very subdued yet emotionally upsetting performance as Michael, the youngest who seemed ostracized from his family at the beginning and now has all the power and success and none of the love or affection his father had. Indeed, one of the main themes of the film is to show how different Michael handles things from his father and whether or not he is a better leader. Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Talia Shire and the tragic John Cazale all contribute so much in their roles, and Robert De Niro made his name known with a flawless performance as the young, ambitious and loyal Vito.Once again, Gordon Willis photographs and once again the darkness shrouds the characters, symbolizing the heavy-handed situations surrounding them. This adds so much to the tone and atmosphere of the story that it completely takes us up in the story and makes the 200 minute running time fly by smoothly. The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II have long been recognized as required viewing for any film lover and I cannot argue. They are so well-made and engrossing that it is impossible to not feel for these characters and the choices they make.The final two scenes are quite something to behold. The first is a flashback to see the kids waiting for Vito to surprise him on his birthday. Here, we see how Michael truly was treated and how Sonny, Tom, and Connie related to one another and how it colored the rest of their existence. The final scene is Michael, alone and contemplating everything that has happened. It is a scene for the audience to contemplate and wonder at the travesty that has abounded. And these two films are truly something to behold and admire for their sheer quality and intensity.	9
pretty amazing	None	Youre not allowed to dislike this film either. This is a massive achievement in every possible sense. Indeed, there is little that rivals these two films in opulence or production scale.Coppola doesnt shy away from trying new things. Michael Corleones story-arc is more realistic, more ambitious than anything in the first film. The scale of crime is upgraded. And I had never expected to see that scene between Michael  Kay, where she tells him of her departure, because of this 2000-year-old Sicilian thing. Vito Corleones backstory follows the earlier, more conventional combination of style and myth. Actually, Coppola makes Vitos arc too obvious, as though hes following a checklist. But again its very tastefully done, so you enjoy it.I guess what this film lacks is a simpler plot and the phenomenal pacing of the first film. Also missing is the magisterial presence of a certain Marlon Brando. It is easier to appreciate this film when you place it together with the first, as one single epic of the rise of one Mafia generation, followed by the decline of another.	9
Slightly better than the original	Philippines	This companion piece of the godfather shows two parallel stories: the tale of Vito Corleones(brilliantly portrayed by Robert DeNiro) simple life in New York and his subsequent rise as a head of a crime empire. the other story shows Michael Corleones(Al Pacino, in an Oscar worthy performance) succession as the new head of the Corleone family. In my opinion this is slightly better than the original, and more emotional, because it showed the transformation of Michaels once innocent mind into a full-fledged Mafia don who will stop at nothing to maintain his empire. This film also brought audience into a great example of irony: Vitos establishment of his empire with love and respect, and Michaels succession full of shattered morality and paranoia. Francis Ford Coppola made a sequel that surpasses the brilliance of the original, a modern classic, and Pacinos greatest performance to date.	10
Almost as good as the original!!!	Bulgaria	And that is saying a lot.Probably the most fantastic and well made sequel of all time.Some consider it to be even slightly better than the original but for me the first Godfather is still the best mainly because of Marlon Brando.Despite of that The Godfather part 2 is a flawless movie,a timeless masterpiece with countless qualities that crabs the viewer and never ceases to impress.Al Pacino delivers simply a stunning performance and deserved an Oscar for best actor.Here he isnt the fragile,insecure young man he was in the original film.Here he is wiser and more respectful.Perfect Michael Corleone.The rest of the cast is amazing too.Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen and John Cazale as Fredo shine once again.Cazale as the treacherous Fredo has a bigger role and makes an even greater impact on the audience.But a lot of the credit has to go to the brilliantly cast Robert De Niro who indeed deserved to win the Oscar for best supporting role.His portrayal of the young Vito Corleone and his rise to power is simply stunning.Excellent work.Director Francis Ford Coppola is simply one of the greatest directors not only of his time but of all times and shows once again that he is the biggest fan of the novel and shows great respect both towards Mario Puzo and his work.	10
even better than part 1	Germany	The Godfather Part 2 is easily better than part 1 for several reasons.1. The telling of Con Coleones rise in power with Robert De Niro is very exciting and De Niro is amazing.2. The scene where Micheals brother Fredo is killed is the best scene in the film.3. I felt there was a bit more action but there was still time for story and character development.4. The last scene with Micheal sitting on the bench is also very good.5. The score is just as in Part 1 superb.So all in all Part 2 is better than Part 1 which didnt really believe could be possible.	10
A great sequel and enduring vision of corruption and family.	Wolves, England	Without a doubt, Coppola made four of the best films of the 70s. The Godfaher Part 1, Part 2, The Conversation and Apocalypse Now. Out of these, The Godfather Part 2 remains my favourite.It continues the Corleone family tale, of greed and corruption and yet Part 2 adds another vein to the bloodstream of this biblical tale; the story of Vito Corleone and his arrival in New York. The cinematographer, Gordon Willis creates a sepia-washed dream of a New York. Every shot is sumptuous ad full of depth - the production value was a help too, with some of the most authentic streets scenes ever committed to film.Though, as wonderful as the film looks, the acting is stellar to. De Niro completely transforms himself from the urban maniacs like Johnny from Mean Streets and Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, to form Vito Corleone, the younger Marlon Brando. De Niro doesnt over cook the character, instead he simmers; his eyes tell two tales, one of being content, the other of contempt, for the killing of his family.De Niro is backed up by great co-stars, such as Bruno Kirby who played the young Clemenza. The story itself in this section of the film is slow burning, much like the rest of the film, yet is here to serve a contrast to the story of Michael Corleone in Nevada.This is the part in the trilogy where Michael transforms from the college boy and war hero of part 1, into the heartless, muted confusion that he embodies here. Pacino plays the part with ease and never goes wild and shout, much like his later work (Glengarry Glen Ross, Godfather Part 3...). Keaton is superb as the WASP wife, Kay, who tries to break free of the corruption she has married into. Cazale, who plays Fredo is wonderful too, a helpless, jealous character, who forms one of the best brother characters in film history. The co-stars are also great, with Strasberg as Hyman Roth.Just as Michaels family is dissolving, Vitos is just beginning. The two fragments of the Corleone history run side by side to depict the downfall of Michaels character. Constantly trying to please his dead father, Michael talks of family, but doesnt understand how to sustain it.A classic.	10
Not just a sequel, but another masterpiece of a continuing story.	United States	The Godfather Part II, is just as good as the first film. Al Pacino was absolutely awesome in this film. His performance in this film is one of my personal favorites, and probably one of his best performances of all time. This film was so good because it continues the story of Don Michael Corleone's rise to the top, and then slowly to the bottom at the end. Plus another cool thing about the movie, is that it has several flash backs on the life of younge Vito Corleone, played by Robert DeNiro (who also gave a great performance). Again the directing, and story telling, and the acting were great in this movie. It is truly the greatest sequel of all time.	10
One of the best sequels ever made	Milwaukee, WI	An excellent follow up to the original, The Godfather Part II continues where the first film left off and explores the rise of Vito Corleone in a series of flashbacks that, for the most part, correlate with what is presently happening to Michael Corleone (Pacino) his son and successor. This is a beautifully produced piece of film, and while I still prefer the first installment, simply because of the story content, it is every bit as good.  This film is best when watched together with the first film  if your body can stand it.  Even better, watch the third one as well for a little closure and so you can argue over whether it's a good film or not.  (I myself personally like the third film, but not as much as the first two.)--Shelly	8
Poor Fredo! We still miss John Cazale!	United States	The Godfather Part II has excellent writing, plotting, editing is even brilliant, acting, and overall quality to watch over again and again. You can never get sick of watching this film. I miss John Cazale. He was truly a gifted actor and I miss him. He played my favorite Corleone brother. Sure Alfredo was never brilliant or vicious but he was sweet, gentle, and warm most of the time. He had a conscience and I despise Michael for killing his own brother. I think he killed him out of jealousy. Alfredo spent more time with Michael's son, Anthony, than he did and he resented him for it. Alfredo could have been spared. Four years after Godfather Part II, John Cazale died of cancer after filming the Deer Hunter. He never won an Oscar or made too many films but he made every role memorable. Rest in Peace, John. I miss you.	10
The best sequel ever	India	There are bound to be comparisons to The Godfather,but it definitely comes close to surpass its predecessor but to no avail.But that doesnt take away any credit from another gem from Francis Ford Coppola.There would have definitely been immense pressure on Coppola to deliver the second time after the first one was a huge hit.Robert De Niro was outstanding as the young Don Vito Corleone and truly deserved his Oscar.John Cazale delivers on getting more screen space.But I was disappointed to see that Al Pacino as Michael Corleone after having overshadowed his previous work in the first and having reached greater heights in this one, did not get an Academy award.The film does not disappoint and matches the original in every aspect.Truly outstanding cinema.	10
Michael, I Never Wanted This For You.	Cincinnati, OH, United States	Nino Rotas musical score plays an even greater role in this equal but different successor than it did in the predecessor. Yearning, lamenting, stimulating bygone ages, see how infectiously Nino Rotas music affects our sentiments for the savage events on screen. It is the pulse of the films. One cannot imagine them without their Nino Rota music. Against all our realistic deduction, it guides us to how to feel about the films, and condition us to understand the characters within their own world. Throughout the Corleone familys many criminal actions, we understand that one doesnt have to be a monster in order to live with having done them.In what is both a dual expansion of its predecessor and a masterpiece of juxtaposition in itself, we see Michael Corleone forfeit his remaining shreds of morality and become an empty shell, insecure and merciless. As his father quietly knew in his latter days would be so, Michael has lost sight of those values that made Don Corleone better than he had to be and has become a new godfather every bit as evil as he has to be. The score, with its tonal harmony, its honeyed and emotional aesthetics, is sad, and music can often evoke emotion more surely and subtly than story. Consider several operas with ridiculous stories and lyrics yet contain arias that literally move us to tears.The devolution of Michael Corleone is adjacent with flashbacks to the youth and young manhood of his father, Vito, played with paternal, home-loving subtlety by Robert De Niro. These scenes, in Sicily and old New York at the turn of the century, follow the conventional pattern of a young man on the rise and show the Mafia code being burned into the Corleone blood. No false romanticism conceals the necessity of murder to do business. We dont look at Vito as a victim of his environment, but a product of the depiction of the resorts to which the Italian culture had turned, initially to both protect their homeland and protect their livelihood as immigrants who came to America to be paid less than the blacks.The film opens in 1901 Corleone, Sicily, at the funeral procession for young Vitos father, who had been killed by the local Mafia chieftain, Don Ciccio, over an insult. During the procession, Vitos older brother is also murdered because he swore to avenge his father. Vitos mother goes to Ciccio to beg for the life of young Vito. When he refuses, she sacrifices herself to allow Vito to escape. They scour the town for him, warning the sleeping townsfolk against harboring the boy. With the aid of a few of the townspeople, Vito finds his way by ship to Ellis Island, where an immigration agent, mishearing Vitos hometown of Corleone as his name, registers him as Vito Corleone. From this very opening, and the events that gradually follow, we see that Vitos damnable early experiences have enhanced his sense of family, and his experience of revenge as a necessity was passed on to Vitos sons.The life of young Vito helps to explain the forming of the adult Don Corleone. As his unplanned successor Michael, his youngest child, transforms, we hark back to why, when his true desire is to make the Corleone family completely legitimate, he feels that he must play the game by its old rules. His wife says, You once told me: In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. That was seven years ago. What we have are two all-too-real narratives, two superb lead performances and lasting images. There is even a parallel between two elderly dons: Revenge must be had.I admire the way Coppola and Puzo require us to think along with Michael as he feels out fragile deliberations involving Miami boss Hyman Roth, his older brother Fredo, and the death of Sonny in the previous film. Who is against him? Why? Michael drifts several explanations past several key players, misleading them all, or nearly. Its like a game of blindfolded chess. He has to envision the moves without seeing them. Coppola shows Michael breaking under the burden. We recall that he was a war hero, a successful college student, forging an honest life. Ultimately Michael has no one by whom to swear but his aging mother. Michaels desolation in that scene of dialogue informs the films closing shot.So this six-time Oscar-winning three-and-a-half-hour gangster epic is ultimately a dreary experience, a mourning for what couldve been. It is a contrast with the earlier film, in which Don Corleone is seen defending old values against modern hungers. Young Vito was a murderer, too, as we more fully understand in the Sicily and New York scenes of Part II. But he was wise and diplomatic. Murder was personal. As Hyman Roth says, It had nothing to do with business. The crucial difference between the father and son is that Vito is cognizant of and comprehending the needs, feelings, problems, and views of others, and Michael grows in the very opposite direction. Whereas the first movie was a taut ensemble piece, this second part is a more leisurely film that closely studies only these two characters, neither of whom share scenes with each other. Everyone else is periphery.It must be seen as a piece with the consummate mastership of The Godfather. When the characters in a film truly take on a simulated environmental existence for us, it becomes a film that everyone who cherishes movies to any extent should see at least once.	10
The Godfather never forgets,nor he ever forgives.	India	If the Godfather is a masterpiece then this is a grand-masterpiece. How often do you see a work of perfection in movies? After watching this movie,you can (at least) answer once. The movie is the sequel and prequel to The Godfather as you all must know and shows the rise of Vito and Michael Corleone in two separate story lines. In this movie we see the rise of Vito Corleone to become The Godfather and how Michael Corleone expands his family business but we also see his moral degradation.In the Godfather we see Vito Corleone has no regrets for his deeds because he had maintained his virtues but in this movie Michael regrets his deeds very much because he has morally degraded(which we see at the end).This is a fair depiction of changing times. If you want to see a movie that leaves you with doubts about right and wrong ,justice and injustice ,hero and villain ;do watch this movie.	10
This should be #1 in the top 250 here in IMDb.	Canada	The Godfather is basically the bridge that connects to stories in this movie.This movie takes you to the origins of Don Corleone and gave you an idea of how he rose to power and how respected he was in Sicily.While The Godfather is a work of art, this is a masterpiece.Everything you saw in the original movie plus more.A lot of character development, strong performances from all actors and great storytelling exist in this Dark Drama.Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and the rest are all excellent in their respected roles.With a movie this good, who knew the third one would not be as good as the first one at least? Highly recommended.My rating: 10/10	10
The Continuing Saga Of The Corleones	Buffalo, New York	Although most movie sequels never equal the original this is certainly not the case of The Godfather: Part II. Many would argue it surpasses the original. With both films declared the Best Picture by the Motion Picture Academy in their separate years, Id hate to argue the difference.In this case we should thank the executives at Paramount for retaining both director Francis Ford Coppola and the original The Godfather author Mario Puzo to put their talents to this film. Id hate to think what would have happened in other hands. Certainly these two men knew their characters and knew how to expand on them. And the best thing about The Godfather: Part II is that one can pick up the story, at least the modern portion of this one without reference to the original. In fact viewing this film will give you a burning passion to see the first.Unlike The Godfather and The Godfather: Part III, this film runs on two parallel tracks. The modern story is a continuation of Al Pacino as Michael Corleone now residing on the shores of Lake Tahoe and now directing the family affairs from Nevada where the Corleone family is heavily into gambling as we well know organized crime was back in those days of the Fifties and Sixties. Hes going into partnership with Lee Strassberg playing Hyman Roth, a thinly veiled portrait of Meyer Lansky. But there are a lot of things making Pacino hesitant about this move into Cuba under the Battista dictatorship.The prequel parallel story is how young Vito Corleone came to this country as an orphan and worked his way up to establish himself as a crime boss. Here Coppola does a brilliant job in capturing the flavor of pre-World War I New York in the Italian ghetto. Robert DeNiro is young Vito Corleone and won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Remarkable when you consider that two of his rivals were Lee Strassberg from this film and Michael V. Gazzo playing Frankie Pantangeli from this film as well, the Mafia kingpin turned Senate witness modeled on Joe Valachi. DeNiro and Marlon Brando have the unique distinction as players of winning an Oscar for playing the same role.The woman do better in this film as in the original. Talia Shire got an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category as Connie Corleone Rizzi. You remember her husband betrays the family and is killed in the original. She now is a drunken dependent on Pacino. Diane Keatons character of Kay Adams Corleone is expanded here as well. Shes a cultural outsider and the Sicilian vendetta code that shes expected to approve without comment becomes too much to bare. Her scene with Pacino when she tells him shes leaving him is one of the best for both in their respective careers.Overlooked unfortunately at award time was John Cazale as Fredo Corleone. Hes the middle son whos passed over for succession after eldest son James Caan is killed in The Godfather. Fredos big moment in The Godfather is being unable to fire his weapon in defense of his father being shot and how he breaks down.Fredos got feelings as John Cazale dramatically points out. He does something really stupid in this film and it costs him dear. Cazale has some of the best moments in this film.If the first Godfather film doesnt do it, The Godfather: Part II will have you permanently hooked on the inner workings and dynamics of the Corleone family both in the criminal and personal sense.	10
Considered by some	Italy	Critics to be better than the original artistically at least. I am still not sure myself but they may be right. It continues the legacy of the Corleone Family and digs into the roots of their criminal empire. There are a series of flashbacks and that could be confusing to some and to be honest I'm not sure that was positive for the flow of the picture but who am I to criticize that. There is more violence here than in the first Godfather and several scenes, like the original, feature real life events. I personally like the first one better probably because of Brando but I will watch both without reservation. Pacino shines here as brightly as in the first one and DeNiro gives it some much needed weight to replace or more accurately continue Brando's character. It is also much sadder than the first in my opinion and shows the misery and depravity of young Vito's life and why he was what he was. It is a true masterpiece.	10
Sequel + Prequel = monumental film-making	Durham, NC	Francis Ford Coppola came perilously close in this film to accomplishing something rarely, if ever, done: he nearly made the second movie revolving around a particular set of characters and themes better than the first.In the truest sense of the word, Godfather II is NOT a sequel, nor was it intended to be. What Part II does is fill in details about Don Vito Corleone's arrival in America and rise to underworld power. That story was told by Mario Puzo in the novel, but involved too lengthy a story to include in the 1972 film. Coppola and Puzo did the next best thing: they told the prequel, the rise to power of Don Vito Corleone (Robert DeNiro) and then appended to the prequel the story of the Corleone family subsequent to Michael's gangland triumph at the close of the first film. Appended should not be taken to have a pejorative connotation. There is certainly nothing slapdash about the tale of the Corleone family's fortunes following the obliteration of the rival gang leaders at the end of the first film.Al Pacino is stunningly believable as the still-reluctant Don Michael Corleone. He wants to move the family business toward legitimacy, but in the end events compel him to be strong for everyone by taking down all of the family's enemies, even when one of them is his older brother Fredo (John Cazale, again brilliant).Unlike the first film, Coppola does not pull off the same level of audience empathy for the Corleone family in the second film. Clearly the life of the crime boss is costing Michael everything while he gains all the power in the world. The first film is more equivocal on that point and also remarkably draws the viewer into a world where the Corleones can be viewed with some empathy. In Part II, Michael is far more cold-blooded and consequently a less sympathetic character. He seems less drawn into the vortex of organized crime by unexpected events, as was the case in the first film, and more the ruthless manipulator.This is really two great films in one. Vito Corleone's rise to power is portrayed with subtle intensity by DeNiro, always observant and always absorbing important information from his observations. Those scenes really capture remarkably the story of Don Vito's early years woven by Puzo in the novel. Wrapped around that prequel is a marvelous continuation of the original story with remarkable twists and turns and deft uses of historical circumstances (Congressional racketeering hearings and the Castro revolution in Cuba). This is another magnificent film, and fitting second step in the Godfather story.Don't end the story with the first Godfather movie. See them both. As for Godfather 3, well, if you really want to go ahead, but be prepared for a let down.	10
The Godfather Part II	Marietta, OH	I have to agree with Robert Towne when he said this film is one of the greatest achievements in the history of screenwriting. When the camera follows DeNiro as he moves from rooftop to rooftop, falling into the abyss filled with crime and corrpution, it will affect him and his family forever. DeNiro is slick and smooth as the young Vito Corleone. The rise of Michael Corleone's power is superbly captured by Coppola and delivered with cold hearted villainy by Al Pacino, in his finest performance. Strasberg is also solid in his performance of Hyman Roth. It's nice to see him put that method to work. The only one who feels out of it here is Duvall who seems to be simply going through motions. It may have been that Tom's character is also given limited depth within the script. It is a superb sequel, argued by many to be superior to the original.	10
A rich epic based on great performances - a little too lush but still a great tale of the corrupting nature of power	United Kingdom	Michael Corleone continues his rise within organised crime in 1950's America, by expanding his family's empire across hotels and casinos.  When an attempt on his life fails Michael proceeds with his dealings in Cuba with Hyman Roth, a deal that will not be as straightforward as it appears. Meanwhile we are told the story of a young Vito's move to American and his rise from the ghetto up into the world of organised crime.I don't know what I can actually add to the sheer weight of praise that has been heaped onto this film - it is as accomplished a film as everyone says and is rightly one of the few examples of a sequel improving and building on a film.  The plot follows two separate strands, the continuing rise of Michael that is as much detrimental to his family as it is beneficial to his pocket; the other thread being Vito's arrival in America as a child and his rise up within the Italian ghettos.  The two stories are not as intertwined as I had remembered - they are very separate and the film can go for quite a while before it switches over.  In a way this works better as it allows both stories to go ahead without fragmenting either too much.This film, as with many gangster films, has been accused of glamorising the life of crime and those involved in it, however, if anything Godfather II does this even less than the original did.  The film shows the moral collapse of Michael in the same way as the first showed his power.  In fairness it does contrast the rise of the two dons - showing how Vito manages to keep his family together.  Despite this I would still argue that Michael's path is far from glamorous.The two narratives are both excellent but for different reasons.  Vito's rise is very interesting and provides solid back story to the first film and we can clearly see the change in Vito from a quiet young man to the influential powerbroker that he became - we also sadly see the rise in his demons and his viciousness.  Meanwhile Michael's tread sees more powerful deals and double crosses as he continues to gain more power.  This was overly complicated for me the first time I saw it but, with reviewing it I have gotten more from it each time - more understanding and more enjoyment. The twin stories are both engaging and the three hour plus running time passes effortlessly - this is a saga and it never feels like the running time was anything more than what was necessary.The cast are fantastic.  Naturally the kudos go to the two leads, and they deserve it.  Pacino has a less showy role than in the first film as he has already done his falling - here we only see further proof of the corrupting nature of his power.  De Niro steals the film this time with a measured performance that parallels Michael's change in the first film - it is a performance that lacks a certain amount of personality but shows us the traits that the film is interested in.  As before the support cast are great, Duvall is reliable as ever, while the most improved role goes to Cazale, who's Fredo becomes more important to the story and almost becomes a biblical character.  Quality comes in waves with Shire, Strasberg, Spradlin, Kirby and many others with solid performances.  Keaton is good but she is not given as much time as I would have liked, even if her scenes are important and powerful.Overall this is a great film that is based on a classy pair of stories that bring the subtexts with them and a collection of characters that are well developed by a script and some great actors.  It may be a little too lavish and plush for my own personal tastes, but it is a rich story.  To a certain degree the production values and sheer class of this film could be accused of glamorisation, but generally those who say this have managed to totally miss the fact that this is a cautionary tale that shows the corruption of power.	8
Nice Movie	Bangladesh	Robert De Niro became the only actor to win and Oscar for taking over another actors Oscar-winning performance. He was not, however, the first or last such actor to be nominated for this. Grard Depardieu was nominated for Best Actor in Cyrano DE Bergerac (1990), a role that had already won an Oscar for Jose Ferrer. Like Brando, Ferrer had played his role in English. Like DeNiro, Depardieu played the role in the characters native language; in this case French. Years later, Jeff Bridges would be nominated for his performance in True Grit (1969). John Wayne had won his only Oscar for his performance in the original film, which also featured Robert Duva.	10
Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under sprawl	Indonesia	The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch- blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I cant remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the films importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see.	10
Incredible doesnt even BEGIN to describe it	United States	The first sequel to win the Best Picture Oscar, and deservingly so, words cannot begin to describe how amazing this film is. Unlike the first (Ill admit, Im not the biggest fan of the first film) which had several slow spots, GFII had me riveted from beginning to end. Pacino and Cazale turn in the performance of their careers, while Francis Ford Coppola, who co- wrote this with Mario Puzo, directs with such precision. This film is truly a gift of cinema by all the talent involved. Everybody, even the smallest supporting actor, give terrific performances. The pace is fantastic. The writing is brilliant. The last scene at the lake...chills! Watch this masterpiece NOW!4/4	10
understand	Japan	I rated this movie a 1 star not because it wasnt entertaining or wasnt cinematically compelling. I rated this movie one star because the message this movie delivers is ignorantly backwards. Throughout this film, we watch (in vivid detail) as Chris Kyle assassinates hundreds of Iraqi men, women, and even children in order to protect American troops. And yet, this movie ends a memorial. I understand that Chris Kyle did his job well. But that does not mean he should be honored as a hero. I love the United States. This is an amazing country. And so it bothers me when Hollywood portrays an American hero as someone who is willing to kill people without critically evaluating why they should be killed, who sees war as purely good versus evil, and who is hopelessly blind to the bigger picture. If there is ever to be peace in this world - heck, if we want to protect the US - we need to glorify people who are compassionate, who can put themselves in other peoples shoes, and who act in ways that promote trust and love - instead of fueling the cycle of anger and hate. Go see this movie. But please dont swallow it up without thinking first.	10
Flawless masterpiece	Edinburgh, Scotland, UK	This is, for me, one of the greatest of all time. Any sequel to the original - again - one of the all time greatest - was always going to be tough. But to follow it with such a timeless masterpiece is nothing short of astonishing. The acting all round is utterly electrifying - from the big performers to the bit part players and extras. Each part is played to perfection. This is one of those rare movies that is totally complete. Words can barely do it justice. You could watch it a thousand different times and take a thousand different lessons from it. You could notice something each time that you hadnt spotted before. This is cold, unforgettable and absolutely absorbing. If you havent seen it before - go and watch it. If you have seen it before - go and re - watch it. Im not sure well ever see anything that matches its like again.	10
Coppola Puts Himself In The Pantheon With Epic Part II Of The Saga	United Kingdom	Its hard to give an objective review when you are dealing with favourite movies. Having just watched this for the first time in years I was delighted to see it was as magnificent as I remembered it. Francis Ford Coppola would have been sensible to be wary of doing a sequel when hed just made a film as acclaimed as The Godfather. How do you follow that? Amazingly he managed to broaden the themes of the original, producing a study of power and corruption that may be unequalled in Hollywood history. And whereas some critics found the first film questionable in its moral compass (is Michael supposed to be a hero?) the sequel leaves us in no doubt that he has passed on into something else and as his wife Kay shrewdly notices, there is no coming back. Judge the film on its own merits and ignore the continuation of the saga in Part III. This is the final Michael as we should always remember him.The scope of Part II is extraordinary (as if the first film wasnt bold enough!) with the story of father Vito in 1920s New York cross- cut with son Michaels rivalry with ageing mobster Hymen Roth, a respected, though never trusted, business partner of his father. These later sequences may not make sense on first viewing but there are some remarkable set pieces from revolutionary Cuba to a Senate committee in Washington. This is a no holds barred portrait of American society corrupt and hypocritical from top to bottom. How often has Hollywood been so daringThe film invites a contrast between father and son, with young family man Vito embracing criminality out of necessity and using his status to become a Godfather in the Italian American community. Meanwhile in his middle age Michael has become a Don hooked on vengeance with all business now personal. The inevitable conclusion of which is a violent crescendo with him not just wiping out his enemies (again) but committing the far worse sin of betraying his own family. Few films can have gathered such a fine cast. Al Pacinos Michael is the symbol of idealism turned sour in extremis. More than anything this is what elevates The Godfather over so many other gangster films. Hes not just some Goodfella or ordinary guy, he once aspired to be a great man but somewhere something went wrong. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen is the great constant across the two films, always at the side, never changing, but in his reaction to the transformation of Michael we get confirmation of his moral decline. Diane Keaton as Kay has a meatier role this time and as the voice of respectable America shows the futility of Michaels actions. If he cant keep his family together, whats it all for? John Cazales Fredo is a tragedy of his own. Secretly resentful of his younger brother, their mutual betrayal becomes one of the emotional cores of the saga. Replacing the character of Clemenza proved relatively easy as even if the story loses something, Michael V. Gazzo was memorable whilst the legendary Lee Strasborg is a suitably cast as rival/partner and pretend Uncle to Michael Hymen Roth, delivering one of the movies great speeches.So often artists seem burdened by great achievements, but not here. One can only assume that the young Coppola was so exulted by the critical and commercial phenomenon of The Godfather, he felt capable of anything and judging by this, he near enough was. One only wonders why hes largely struggled to reach similar heights ever since.	10
Certainly the best movie	Norway	I love this movie for of the very interesting scenario. I also consider the actors playing, certainly amongst the best of their generation. Decors, costumes are also part of the reason I love it.The fact it is about European immigrants in the US, makes it also better for European to watch, without it being one 100% US culture movie. Also some points are true story, that makes it quite remarkable.Overall, I can say that this movie is truly violent, but not as per 2015 understanding. The violence can come in many ways. However, and despite this aspect, this is quite one remarkable movie which deserves to stay up and high in the IMDb ratings.The second part is maybe the best, but is actually really close from the first episode, which in my eyes is actually on the same level.	10
Its about one mafia handing over control to the future mafia	None	This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.i copied bcoz i needed .	10
KIng Coppolla hits a home run again!	United States	People say that The Godfather: Part II is one of the greatest hits in history.And I cannot disagree!It hits exactly what I was looking for in a Godfather sequel.It puts all the other godfather movies to shame,and hits all the marks from the previous movie spot on.The reason I gave it a 9 of 10 was because it went a over the line a couple times with some things, and is a tad bit lengthy but still enjoyable.Although it is not part of the book and just a long extension of it but still incredibly entertaining.I doubt the only other legitimate criticsm is that this movie is freaking awesome!It always keeps the ball rolling and never backtracks you,and always keeps you up and going with famous scenes and unforgettable one liners.This movie was a launching pad for many famous modern day actors to make their mark.For 1970 this was immensely un cheesy and one of my very favorite movies.I highly suggest watching this movie if you have 4 hours of your time to sit back and watch a masterpiece.I suggest to watch the first one just to catch up.I have never seen a better sequel since The Winter Soldier.The only way you cannot enjoy this movie if youre only in to modern day crap!	9
The greatest sequel to date?!?!	United States	The Godfather debuted in 1972 to rave reviews, millions in box office receipts, and awards galore. Obviously, there was high demand for a sequel. So after great anticipation, could it be possible for Coppola to deliver?Everything great about the first film is equally great. The film follows two story lines, I believe this choice is perfect because it separates part II from the original, while showing the contrast between don Vito, and don Michael. Vito was in control, a family man, made compromises. Michael has no remorse, business is his first, and only priority.In my opinion the first and second godfather films are perfect. They are entertaining, but by perfect I am referring to the technical aspects of the films. Everything that filmmaking represents is in the forefront of the godfather and the godfather part II. On a side note, I dont understand this notion that the godfather films are the best films that nobody actually watches. I watch the first two at least twice a year.	10
Better Than The Original? Maybe. Unbelievable Ride? HELL YEAH!!	Canada	The Godfather Part II is said by many to be the best sequel ever. I personally think that is arguable, since it arguably surpasses its proceeder and checking out the Lord of the Rings sequels and the Empire Strikes Back. Say this is the best sequel ever and I will not disagree. Say this is better than the first and I will agree. Honestly, I keep changing my mind about which instalment is better every time I watch them. This last time I watched them, the first one seemed better to me. The time before, this one was the superior picture. I dont care which is better, as long as I have 200 minutes of no interruptions while watching this.With the success of The Godfather in 1972, it was only natural for there to be a sequel. The Godfather Part II acts as both a sequel and a prequel, with the sequel being written by Coppola and Puzo and the prequel being taken from the novel. When Pacino broke out in the first movie, he topped it one year later with Serpico. His performance in this tops Serpico and everything else hes ever done. Unfortunately, he lost his sure Oscar win to Art Carney. Yes, Carney was worthy, but put him in the same category as Al Pacino for perhaps the best role ever and he becomes very unworthy. The people at the Academy probably thought Pacino would just get better and they could give him an award later. That would not come until 1993 when he won for a role in Scent of a Woman that was inferior to all that he did in the 70s. At least the Academy got the Best Picture win right. That was a given. Pacinos rival/friend/co- star, Robert De Niro took home the win for Best Supporting Actor, beating out their acting teacher, Lee Strasberg. De Niro became the first Oscar winner to not say a word of English. I dont know what it was about his portrayal, but there was some sort of magic contained with utter brilliance. Strasberg and Michael Gazzo where also fantastic, but both did not possess an unknown magic that few can bring to the table.The prequel follows a child Vito Corleone whos family is poor. He witnesses his family begin murdered by Corleones most powerful mob boss. He heads to America and grows up on the streets there too. Years later, an adult Vito (De Niro) rises to the top of New Yorks underworld and is determined to avenge his familys death. Revenge stories like this have been done to death, but almost none have been executed this good. The sequel takes place a few years after the first with Michael (Pacino) as the Don. After he successfully dodges an assassination attempt, ordered by Hyman Roth (Strasberg), Michaels fears about loyalty, betrayal and murder lead him to a severe paranoid state making him a deadly madman. Both stories are less complex than the original, but both together make one hefty team. Al Pacino outdoes Marlon Brando and himself in one of the top five greatest roles of the screen. He leads an all-star cast in what is arguably better acting than the first. With most of this being arguably better than the first, Coppolas direction surpasses the first. The cinematography, sets and camera tricks beat out all the first had, which were great.	10
Not as good as the original, but still a great crime film	London, United Kingdom	My opinions on this movie are a bit mixed. The opening for the film was brilliant as it delves into the early life of Vito Corleone and then flash-forwards to the story of his son Michael Corleone following the events of The Godfather (1972). It was all interesting up until it started faltering during the lengthy middle portion of the film, when Michael travels around to various different places meeting different underworld figures. The pacing and editing was quite bad during the middle portion, so much so that I even found it somewhat boring to watch. It could have been better if Francis Ford Coppola was willing to trim some bits here and there during the middle portion. Nevertheless, the final portion of the film was back on track and largely made up for the weak middle portion. Like the original Godfather, the last 80 minutes of The Godfather Part II were very gripping and moving, with the ending probably being even more powerful than that of the original. The film had the potential to be just as good as, if not better than, the original Godfather if only if it wasnt for the overall inconsistency and the weak middle portion of the film.As for the performances, Al Pacino was again brilliant as Michael Corleone, while Robert De Niro was also very believable as a young Vito Corleone. The other cast members were also impressive, with some of the more minor characters from the first film, like John Cazale (as Fredo Corleone) and Diane Keaton (as Kay), getting more major roles this time around. Although I have criticized this film quite a bit, those criticisms are only relative to its predecessor, as The Godfather Part II is still quite easily among the greatest crime films of all time in its own right.9/10	9
Your country aint your blood. Remember that	Australia	To call The Godfather: Part II (1974) a sequel doesnt quite do it justice. It is more of a companion piece to the original film, serving as both a prequel and a sequel, both expanding and enriching the characters and story presented in The Godfather (1972). This week I was fortunate enough to attend a cinema screening of the second film {each instalment of the trilogy played over three consecutive weeks}, and needless to say it was well worth the late night. When we last left Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), hed just been baptised into the world of organised crime. Now, years on, he must accept that his position of corrupt power can only lead to the disintegration of his family, and the loss of everybody hes ever cared about. Michaels plateau of despair, following the impressive rise we witnessed in The Godfather, is here juxtaposed with the historical ascent of his father Vito Corleone (now played by Robert De Niro) from a humble but traumatic childhood in Corleone, Sicily. The comparison delicately suggests the downside of the so-called American Dream in which Vito believes so passionately.As with The Godfather, Coppolas film could only have succeeded with interesting and authentic acting performances, and the cast doesnt disappoint. Al Pacino has rarely been better, playing Michael Corleone with a violent intensity that suggests the lasting influence of brother Sonny (James Cann), who was assassinated in the previous film. Pacinos scene with Diane Keaton, in which we learn that she received an abortion for her unborn son, is one of the most traumatic moments of spousal interaction Ive ever seen, with Pacino exhibiting a barely-suppressed rage through his severe, almost fearful, eyes, and a quiver in the jaw. An under-appreciated John Cazale brings depth and pathos to weaker brother Fredo, and Robert Duvall is excellent as Tom Hagen. New to the Godfather cast are Lee Strasberg (President of the Actors Studio) and Michael V. Gazzo, as business associates who may be plotting against the Corleone family. De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal of a younger Don Vito, understatedly evoking the essence of the character without parodying Marlon Brando.The Godfather: Part II is certainly an impressive achievement, but it doesnt quite manage to equal its predecessor. Whereas the original film achieved the bulk of its emotional power through the transformation of its central character, Part II leaves Michael hopelessly stranded in his despair, portraying neither his rise nor his downfall. Having effectively sold his soul for the family in the previous film, Michael must now come to terms with his desolation, alone in his misery, and having long forsaken any opportunity for salvation. He concludes the film still at the height of organised crime in America, and yet receives no reassurance from his position of power. Michael is alone, a dejected and self-loathing soul, without comfort from the family he helped destroy. Its a haunting ending that will remain with you for hours afterwards, but nevertheless doesnt seem like a conclusive ending to the entire Corleone saga. Fortunately, Coppola returned sixteen years later to direct The Godfather: Part III (1990), which charts, I believe, Michael Corleones inevitable downfall. Hopefully I wont be disappointed.	9
the saga continues	United States	The first Godfather film was a beautifully rendered, violent and at times even warmhearted look inside a Mafia crime family. It deserved all the accolades it received for direction, cinematography, art direction and of course those wonderful performances by Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall and the rest of the cast. I think its fair to say no one expected the sequel to outshine the original, but to many peoples minds, somehow it did. It is even more intricate and expansive, presenting two stories at great length, one taking place before the first film and the other, continuing the firsts narrative. The Godfather Part II has been called both the greatest sequel of all time and the greatest American film, period. It was nominated for 11 Oscars. The sequel part of the film concerns Michael Corleones attempts to hold his family and its business together after the death of Vito Corleone. Times are changing and he sees an opportunity to invest in Havanas casinos with the help of Hyman Roth, a former associate of his fathers, and the pre-Castro, pro-business government in Cuba. The plot of Part II is difficult to follow at times; there are double-crosses, and perceived double-crosses that really arent, and its hard to know who is sincere about what. The only thing that is certain is that everyone looks after their own interests and there is no hesitation in using murder as a final negotiating tool. Killings and attempted killings continue, but in this film, they are more methodical and cold-blooded. Toward the end, Tom Hagen even asks Michael Corleone if he feels the need to kill everyone. No, Michael says, just our enemies. But when one of those enemies turns out to be his own brother, Fredo, it is clear that things have changed in the Corleone family, and not for the better. Francis Ford Coppola spoke of the inevitable decline in the Corleone family and it is very apparent, never more so than when Michael gives the order to have Fredo murdered. The prequel segments are, by contrast, very simple and tell the story of how Vito Corleone arrived in America and began to build his empire. Robert DeNiro does not so much replace Marlon Brando as offer an interpretation of Corleone as a young man. There is wonderful period detail in these scenes; the tenement neighborhoods of the recently arrived Italians, living in their own section of New York, bits of broken English beginning to find their way into the mother tongue. Its all filmed in sepia-tinted color, which creates the feeling of a time passed, like looking at old photographs. Unlike the 1950s plot, the turn-of-the-century story is fairly cut-and-dried. Vito Corleone marries, starts a family, and begins a loose partnership with other young immigrants in what will eventually become the Corleone crime family. He kills the neighborhood crime boss, the one who collected protection money from all the local businesses, and effectively replaces him and the old way, becoming a more benevolent, friendlier version of the Black Hand, if no less lethal when the need arises. He even finds time to travel back to Sicily and visit revenge on the aged crime lord there who had murdered members of his family. The Godfather Part II is filled with memorable performances, all of the continuing characters portrayed by the same actors as the first film. It is an epic undertaking and rewards repeated viewings with new detail unnoticed previously, not to mention better understanding of the labyrinth plot intrigues. It is also ultimately depressing, in a way the first movie wasnt. In spite of everything, the audience was pulling for the Corleone family to succeed and win out over its enemies in The Godfather; I dont think thats the case at the end of The Godfather Part II.	9
A SO much better movie then its predecessor.	Sydney, Australia	The Godfather Part 2 was definitely one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It is so much better than the first in the trilogy in every way, the effects, the acting, the dialogue, the setting and just everything. It is set over such a WIDE environment. It is a very long movie which might bore the young ones that like action-packed car chases/ explosions (which really p**ses me off) but it is an excellent movie for the REAL movie goers out there. Reasons it better than no.1: The special effects are way more up to scratch, the acting is so much better (it almost seems that all the actors from the previous outing have magically gained skills), and the structure is much more secure. It is a must-see movie that intelligent people will love.	9
Masterclass Method acting	Amsterdam	With even the former director of the Actors Studio and proponent of method acting Lee Strasberg having one of the key roles this is one of the strongest acted movies ever. With Brando not present there seems to be more space for others. Especially De Niro impresses here because he had to take Brandos Godfather into account (he mimics his eye, head movement, diction and hand gestures). Both Strasberg and De Niro were nominated but De Niro won from the godfather of method acting.Part 2 is very well structured: Not only is it a great idea to integrate a prequel and a sequel but they enhance each other creating more emotional intensity: death and birth of a child for example. But the greatest achievement in structuring the story comes in the end, when several story lines are intertwining more and more until the short but powerful climax.Again we see that dark and light is used to separate the inner, godfather world from the outer, ordinary world. Only in the beginning there are more lighter scenes in the godfather world to signify Michaels failed efforts to go legitimate. Once again very effective use of doors, mirrors and windows just as in part 1.Where part 1 and the prequel are about the rise the sequel in part 2 is about the fall of the Godfather family (not the empire). Whereas Vito stands for traditional, Italian values, Michael stands for modern, New World-values. The core of the story comes in the end, showing Michael both in the prequel and the sequel as a lonely outsider. Thats why his efforts as a family man fail so dramatically, and hes in fact only excellent in business.	9
Because the original just wasn't good enough	NY	The Godfather: Part II is one of the best sequels ever made, because it's so unlike other sequels.  It not only tells the ongoing story of Michael Corleone, but it also tells the story of his father's rise to being the Godfather.  Al Pacino superbly reprises his role of Michael, and Robert De Niro is, in one word, perfect as Vito Corleone.  Imagine not only learning your lines, but learning them in Italian, and all the while trying to sound like Marlon Brando.  If you can't imagine any one else besides Brando as Don Vito, just check out De Niro's brilliant, Oscar-winning performance.  This is a must-see for any film fan, and especially any fan of the first Godfather.  I actually know people who prefer this sequel to the already fantastic original.  I can't say enough about this movie.  My one piece of advice is see The Godfather: Part II.	
Good film but not as good as the first	None	This is Coppolas epic tale of first generation Italian Americans making their way in the glamorous, criminal underworld of the 1920s and 1950s. The span is vast and ambitious. It cuts between the emerging criminal stronghold of Michael Corleone and the early life of his father, Vito Corleone.The unfolding narrative of Michael Corleones life, dynamics of the familial relations, and the way in which he legitimises his criminal infra-structures were well presented. It is possible to understand the protagonists moves and motives, his character has integrity in that regard.However, frequently and without warning, the flow ended in a crescendo of chaos. The material needed to be ordered and handled more sensitively. Good film but not as cleverly arranged as the first.	8
A great classic	Romania	I enjoyed this movie tremendously. It gracefully blends two times: the fathers, who rises to power through his own forces, and the sons who takes care of his father legacy and increases his influence.Vito and Michael are to wonderful written characters, with both qualities and flaws. Also, the action is very captivating and i loved seeing Vito put the New Yorks scum in their place ;) and revenge his father! Michael is very intense and, just like his father, does everything for the good of the family. Overall, this movie is definitely worth seeing and completes the first film perfectly. As Coppola wanted, they should have stopped here because the 3rd film isnt even close to the masterpieces the 1st and 2nd ones are.	10
The Masterpiece Above All Others	None	What is there to be said about the sequel to what many consider to be the greatest film of all time? The Godfather: Part II is a film unlike any other. From the seedy casinos of Nevada, to the revolution in Cuba, The Godfather: Part II chronicles the reign of Michael Corleone, acted to perfection by Al Pacino, over a massive criminal empire. Corleones dealings with the manipulative and ruthless, but ailing, Hyman Roth, depicted by the masterful Lee Strasberg, are some of the best scenes captured on cinema. Roth is a weary, weathered old man, but he more than holds his own against the young, ambitious Michael Corleone. And how does one describe the character of Michael Corleone? Is he an evil killer that cares only about power, and will do anything to achieve it? Or is he a reluctant son, trying desperately to get out from under the enormous shadow of his father, but assailed on all fronts by enemies old and new? Perhaps both. The story of Michael Corleone in this film is a tragic one, without doubt. But his is not the only tale told in this masterpiece of cinema. The story of Vito Corleone, portrayed entirely in Sicilian by Robert De Niro, is interwoven with that of his son, and it is arguably as potent. A young Sicilian lad, orphaned by a violent Mafioso, Vito is smuggled off the island and to America. There, Vito is met with oppositions and struggles, and he overcomes them all to become the original Godfather. It is truly a journey, and shows the adversity that crafted a giant of a man.The Godfather: Part II beats the odds, and somehow, in my opinion, manages to be a greater film than its predecessor. It is a massive, complex, dark, tragic, ambitious film, and it succeeds in everything it does. 10/10	10
The Best Sequel, Prequel, and Movie Ever Made	United States	Normally, movie sequels arent very good. They are usually just rushed cash-grabs to make money off of a successful property, but occasionally they can be just as good, if not better, than the original film, as rare as this is. (The Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, Aliens, The Dark Knight, and Spider-Man 2 are examples of these.) Prequels are not so different, and are even harder to pull off. So, normally, the 1974 follow-up to Francis Ford Coppolas 1972 masterpiece The Godfather would have a lot to do in order to top the original. But, despite this, The Godfather Part II, is, in my opinion, not only better than the original, but also the best movie of all time. (I take back what I said in my review of the original about it being the best ever made, I hadnt seen this one yet.)The Godfather Part II is actually two films in one. Expertly presenting two story lines, one sequel and one prequel to the original, half of the film follows late-1950s Michael Corleone, now as the head of the Corleone crime family, expanding his power and picking off his enemies, becoming less and less like the man at the beginning of the previous film. The other half follows his father, Vito, in 1920s New York as he creates the empire that later gets passed down to Michael. Both stand out on their own, but the two story lines, brilliantly put together, create a masterpiece that is yet to be matched.Like the first movie, the best element of this movie is the acting. Al Pacino returns as Michael, in what is undoubtedly his best performance of the two films. (I cant say the best of his career, because these two are the only movies of his I have seen. Sorry, Scarface fans.) He is perfect as a man who, through gaining power, loses his humanity. If you have read my review for Lawrence of Arabia, youll remember I named some performances that would be on a list of the Top 10 Best Movie Performances. I have no doubts that Pacino in this film would be right on there.Before watching this, I had doubts as to how the movie would make do without screen legend Marlon Brando, as his character is twenty-five years younger, and so played by Robert De Niro. (I havent yet seen Taxi Driver or Raging Bull.) But after watching it, I feel that he is just as good, and he really deserved his Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor. He is so good that I cant decide who did a better job, him or Brando. Good thing he wasnt cast in the first film, otherwise the world wouldnt have this terrific performance.Although Pacino and De Niro are the highlights in this movies cast, the others are excellent as well. Robert Duvall as Michaels stepbrother, Tom Hagen, really sells his conflicted loyalty/fear of his changing stepbrother. Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, a man who Michael is trying to kill, is excellent. Diane Keaton as Kay, Michaels wife, really shows how she is frightened at what he has now become. And, of course, there is John Cazale as Michaels brother Fredo, the weakling who tries to be stronger than everyone says,but things dont go according to plan. (I wont go into specifics.)Just like the first film, another great aspect is the script. Doing one story line would be hard enough, but the fact that the movie does both so well, so flawlessly, is just amazing. It reintroduces the characters we already know, and take them to further places and develop them more, and also introduces more. It features parallels to the first movie, with similar scenes that show how things have changed. This installment also feels more epic than the first one, as things get bigger and darker.The film is also marvelous in its technical aspects as well. The score by Nino Rota, once again, is beautifully haunting, and even better than in the previous film. The cinematography by Gordon Willis continues to shine. (Even though, ironically, he himself has regretted some scenes that he felt were too dark.) The production design is fantastic, and it helps with the epic scope I mentioned previously. The violence is more realistic, and somewhat more graphic, which gives it a better impact. The editing is also good, as the two story lines are connected beautifully. If I have one problem with the movie, it is that it is slower than the previous film, as its longer by twenty-five minutes, and 3.3 hours makes for a pretty long movie. But, taking into account how brilliant the rest of the movie is, that can be forgiven.This film is so amazing, it astonishes on every level. I may have been disappointed that the first film only won three Oscars, but fortunately this one managed to get six, including a second Best Picture, which were all well deserved. (I have no idea how Pacino didnt get Best Actor, but, according to Some Like It Hot, Nobodys perfect.) Clearly topping the original, The Godfather Part II is the Best Film of All Time, so of course, I have to give it a 10/10 rating.	10
The Greatest Film Ever Made	United States	The film opens, after a short shot of Don Michael Corleone getting his hand kissed, with a group of Sicilians dressed in all black walking through a hot desert to a mournful tune being played by a funeral band. Its a flashback, the first of many, that starts the story of young Vito Corleone. From his tragic reasons for escaping his native home of Sicily, to his rise as respected New York Mafia boss.Robert De Niros portrayal of Vito Corleone rivals Marlon Brandos. In the first film hes played by Brando with the utmost charisma, but we never know the reasons of how he became The Godfather. This superior sequel gives the reasons, and continues the expansion and decline of the Corleone family, circa 1959, in Nevada, and Cuba. The family is now headed by Michael Corleone, a man much more feared than respected, played by Al Pacino. Pacino plays the Don with lifeless eyes. Hes very quiet, save for his occasional outbursts brought on by the stress of his life. He is leading a life his father never intended for him. U.S. senators come to his home and express their distaste for Michaels heritage. His sister hates him. His immediate underling questions his decision to let certain people keep their lives. His wife is tired of this way of life. And of course, people try to kill him...in his home. In his bedroom where his wife sleeps. Where his children come and play with their toys. The attempt on his life prompts a military like approach to try and wipe out every enemy he has. But he has so many, and things dont always go according to plan. He takes pills for the headaches he gets, in plain view of his disapproving grim reaper like bodyguard. Its a dark film. Not only for the lighting of which Oscar winning cinematographer Gordon WIllis shot it in, but because nearly everything that happens in the movie is tragic. There is very little happiness within this film. But its plenty enjoyable. Part I is undeniably a masterpiece, but Part II adds so many things, most notably a group of amazing character actors. From that grim reaper like bodyguard I mentioned, whom by the way never says one word, to Oscar nominated Michael V. Gazzos boastful Frank Pentangeli, who says too much. Gazzo was just as deserved of that supporting actor Oscar as De Niro was, and the whole cast may as well have gotten one too.The more I watch this movie the more I love it, as any movie buff would. Theres so much to appreciate. The more you watch it, the more you see. Little things, subtle but so important. So many of them. Its in one word a masterpiece and in my opinion the greatest movie ever made.	10
Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	Texas	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didnt intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I dont normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better. At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by its technical merits - I dont really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	10
Shawshank Redeems Hollywood	Paducah, KY	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich&eacute;s and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	10
Prepare to be moved	Westerville, Ohio	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	7
A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.	Vancouver, Canada	In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were just happy to be nominated. Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word go, making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on that 'Rickshaw' movie. Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale. But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; In here's where you need it most, he says. You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch. Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.	10
Two movies in one	Chicago, IL	The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.  I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.  However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne?	8
The best story ever told on film	None	I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: Get busy watching, or get busy dying. Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended.	8
The Shawshank Redemption	Marietta, OH	One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people will be talking about in 50 or 100 years.	10
Powerful	Houston, Texas	One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising twist near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.	10
Stephen Kings best adapted movie	Toronto, Ontario	Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly wont be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and Im sure it could be number 1. So Ill just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I dont know if there will again.Im not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.	10
Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.	Long Island, NY	The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with Red Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10	10
This is How Movies Should Be Made	Queens, New York	This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd Red Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Reds group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been institutionalized. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, dont listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.	10
Simply known as The Movie	Madison, WI	Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as The Movie.  When I say The Movie, my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those Budget Theaters over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life! There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... HOPE.  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just comes together is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a must buy for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my favorite of all time, but they've all fallen far short of The Shawshank Redemption. So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the employee picks section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!	10
Don't Rent Shawshank.	United States	I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in The Shawshank Redemption; when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like It's a Wonderful Life and Citizen Kane. It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.	10
Some birds arent meant to be caged.	United Kingdom	The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis Red Redding (Freeman) . While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didnt give much inkling to anyone about what it was about-and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, tho, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.Its possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama thats dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better)  Freeman (sublimely making it easy), its the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support arent faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the Birdman Of Shawshank, Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood  Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then theres Roger Deakins lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newmans score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andys state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then its a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions-anger-revilement-happiness-sadness-inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, tho, Shawshank offers hope; not just for characters in a movie, but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10	10
Great story, wondrously told and acted	United States	At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the only guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didnt win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words His judgment cometh and that right soon. The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you havent seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andys wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). Its the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andys wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabonts direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he cant cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Reds periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: theres not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the sisters, etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the redemption is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Dont miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Cant Believe I Swallowed the Remote! Get it at Amazon!)	8
Busy dying or busy living?	The asylum for the confused and befuddled	**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one.	10
A movie revolution upon all others	Amman, Jordan	We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldnt give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. its simply over qualified!	10
The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced	United States	This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.	10
One of the best movies ever made?	Lithuania	Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it cant match the film. When I sow this movie I thought thats it, this is it, best movie ever. Sure you can find people who didnt like it, and when I ask why, and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they dont like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I cant find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they dont like ratio 9,2, they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge...	10
Good , But It Is Overrated By Some	Isle Of Bute, Scotland	In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters	8
Relentless Storytelling	Virginia Beach	I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!Why? This was my question.The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts.	7
life changing	United Kingdom	I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life	10
Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time	Canada	When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought Yea, I could understand that. I dont necessarily agree that its absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. Its funny, because I dont really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and Id pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that its spoken over. The real beauty of this film is its story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but its the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen Kings novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesnt use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you cant help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. Its one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.	10
The Shawshank Redemption	Viet Nam	A friend of mine listed The Shawshank Redemption as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in front of the TV (a melodrama doesnt kill, right?)I dont know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times, being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before.Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, its about life-changing experiences, about the endless struggle against lifes harshness and unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was nominated, but its all about struggling against unfairness, times proved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150 minutes.	10
A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.	Fort Collins, Colorado	This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.	6
Are you serious??	Birmingham, England	Sorry folks, but can this film really be (one of) the greatest of all time? Entertaining? Yes. Well acted? Err...yes.  'Life affirming'? No way. Realistic? Don't make me laugh.Twenty years or so pass in this film. Does anybody get any older? Apart from the occasional pair of specs, that's it. Not an extra wrinkle to be seen. What happened to the make-up department?People get beaten to within an inch of their lives. One death and one wheelchair case, but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear rapidly.The 'baddies' get their just deserts and we're all supposed to shout 'serve them right' (as we say in England). The 'goodies' live happily ever after, but we knew that would happen within the first ten minutes. The people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a great author. Competent and popular...yes. Great...no!! P.S. Who replaced the poster after...? Was that an oak tree? Maybe leaves are a different shape in America.	5
Movie you can see 1000 times	India	I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole storyline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life.Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail, Morgon Freeman says I have to remind myself that some birds arent meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright This movie has entertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short everything we want to see in a movie.I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life	10
Simply Perfect	United Kingdom	Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.	10
An excellent film contained within a classic	United States	When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didnt see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasnt just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDbs number one spot for a long time to come, Its well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90s were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you havent seen it, dont let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Dont listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You cant over hype this film its just that good. What ive written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb !	10
Im a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.	United States	Well I guess Im a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. Ive seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, The Godfather was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and Ive come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like On The Waterfront, To Kill a Mockingbird and One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I dont mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know its pretty clich to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlens release and new prisoner Tommys introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andys quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one mans confinement for a crime he didnt commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967s Cool Hand Luke, but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that hope can drive a man insane.I really cant recommend this picture highly enough, both for its masterful story telling and its technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance thats virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance.	10
The shortest long movie I've ever seen. Kept me wanting more and more, minute by minute.	Oslo, Norway	At first, before starting the movie, I thought Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie. At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie The Last Castle from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor.	10
Best of all time!!!	India	This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didnt do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.I give it 11/10.	10
For the first time the Movie defeats the Book!	Bangladesh	As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..I didnt understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...The scene just fill my heart with Andys yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didnt find it in the original book version.I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as Dumb-Ass. Andy says....its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction Then Red says..Why dont we put it on Educational category?(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as Educational category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life.Thanx to all.	10
Over Rated	Glen Cove, New York	There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.	7
Very enjoyable, but let's not go overboard, folks	Seattle, Washington	THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is very enjoyable, features excellent performances, and has won a fanatical following among a lot of people.  I just saw it.  I liked it.  But as for becoming fanatically enthusiastic about it, all I can say is, folks, let's not get carried away...The story not only is incredibly *simple* (good man unjustly convicted for horrible crime maintains hope in horrible confinement), but is also incredibly *simplistic* (the Warden and his men are evil goons, the convicts are good).  Complexity is something completely exiled from this story.The director, Frank Durabont, offers nothing new in his aesthetic choices -- SHAWSHANK is stock Hollywood filmmaking, especially of the Spielbergian variety ala THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD.  The soundtrack is overpowering in its efforts to imbue the story with heartwrenching emotion.  The cinematography is fine in a sort-of standard-issue, seen it before way.Which begs the question:  Is there anything truly *exceptional* about THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION?  Heck yeah -- Morgan Freeman proves, once again, that he is not only a wonderful actor but also one of the most endearing, powerful presences in cinema.  Tim Robbins is fine, along with all of the convicts.But overall, I didn't mistake THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for anything particularly new, remarkable, exciting -- in other words, as anything worthy of fanatical enthusiasm.  It's a fine Hollywood film that looks, smells, sounds and feels like your typical fine Hollywood film.  But nothing more.	8
What More Can I Say?	United Kingdom	There are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. I can happily say that The Shawshank Redemption has stuck to me since I finished watching it for the first time, and instantly rocketed up my Top 10 Films list. Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in Shawshank, at least not to me. The hefty run time doesnt put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. Shawshank is one of those films that I would love to experience for the first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and lows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else. In my opinion, Forrest Gump was not as deserving of the Best Picture Oscar as this. The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come.	10
Brilliant  Excellent	United Kingdom	By far the best movie ever...No Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see, It is easily the best movie of my life-time so far.Morgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as well. Well written / narrated and directed movie of all times.10 out 10.It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie rating websites forever now.The best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan Freeman.The character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden character has lot of punch into it.Escape from prison was the best it can ever get.Marvellous piece of Art.	10
A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ...	France	I will never forget the first time I watched The Shawshank Redemption, with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film with the poster was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesnt justify, at least it explains why this movie that didnt do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone The Godfather from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And its only justice if The Shawshank Redemption, the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly. This is the strength of The Shawshank Redemption, its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of having a life. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, were literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, whos like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest. And the comparison with Formans film isnt fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and busy in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his bankers casket again and feels that prison didnt deprive him from his social quality. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the films motto, on which relies its philosophical core is Get busy living or get busy dying. Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, its all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldnt live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldnt help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabonts film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is The Shawshank RedemptionIn the same vein than One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Shawshank is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose. This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.The Shawshank Redemption a powerful adaptation of Stephen Kings novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.	10
The Story of Friendship and Hope...	Turkey	Maybe Im writing a review too late for this movie, but I think I must write something for this.Shawshank Redemption is a truly A Class movie that teaches us many things like friendship and never gave up your hope. Unlike other users, I think this movie deserves to be in IMDb Top 250 list. Today, IMDbs Top 250 List approved and considered by everyone. So, everybody must see that this movie is in top and must watch it to see why IMDb puts this movie on top and not Godfather.I really like the role of Red by Morgan Freeman. He really acts like a experienced jail-mate. Andy Dufresne is okay too.What I really like is that, I really love the end. Maybe this is the best ending ever. I really like how Red laughs to Andy about pickaxe and Andy dig 19 years ( WOW !) to made a hole in the wall, how he escape and become a person he made it up for Wardens dirty job, how his dreams come true and lastly after 5 years in jail after Andy escaped, how Red not decided to suicide, decided to follow Andy.Best Movie Ever...10/10	10
This movie is for every man	United States	There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I dont care what anyones take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.	10
Extraordinary	United States	An analysis of prison life--and of what hope can be in a prison--Frank Darabont's first film is one of the best ever.  Well-written and well-acted, the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming, endearing, poignant.  Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous--it's simply extraordinary drama.	10
A great film, but #2?	Oldham, Gtr Manchester, England.	A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?One user put it very well when they said that the films essential message of the human spirit conquering all is very uplifting an everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridans In the Name of the Father springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. Whats even more heartening is that its also true.Like I said, Im not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then whats new?), the direction is perfect because its so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think its nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly cant agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.#2 of 250? I dont think it would make it into my top 50 films.Ah well, lifes all about opinions...	8
As succinct as I can be	London	Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. As you've come this far and you're a bit of a film fan you go to see a film you've heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago, with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not been moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny Corleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were either plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or happy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed, respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony, I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. I have seen it many times and will see it many more.	10
hope is a good thing,, and good things never,,,,,	India	this is the first time i am really wand to write something about thismovie even though i have watched it a hundred times o so,,,, anyone who really wanna know how a movie should b should watch this one,,,movies are medium which should make us think and this one surely does about life,,,anyone wanna know the meaning of patience determination this one does the trick for u,,,, watch it and be inspired,,,thats all i can say,,,it will change the way u think about things around u,,never let it die in u,,,	10
To be seen once every 6 months, for complete revitalisation of Mind and Soul	India	Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through	10
Superb prison buddy story - but sadly unimportant film	Sweden	If you simply see this as a straightforward storytelling prison film, then it is excellent (10/10) because it truly gets you involved in its main character. It is an extremely enjoyable and compelling experience with a heartfelt and well-acted buddy-story at its core. It delicately--and sometimes brutally--juxtaposes Andy Dufresnes (Tim Robbins) good-natured character with the harshness of prison life, projecting so much heart in doing so.However delightful as it is, The Shawshank Redemption has no allegories and no statements to make and it brought nothing new to cinema in either style or substance. It had no revolutionary ideas or approaches - its only a very safe buddy-story. A damn good one, but still just that. So it can impossibly be a film that will be remembered or studied, because what will it be remembered for? Friendship? Huh, neat. I therefore dont think its entirely deserving of being considered the #2 greatest film of all time on IMDb.com.But moving on and looking past that, it is possibly one of my all-time favourite films for the feelings it leaves. Sure, it often jerks you for tears just a bit too purposely, but this is forgivable because emotion is crucial to a prison story. On top of that, it never falls prey to predictable sappiness - probably because of its content which is devoid of sentimental romance and instead fills you up with a tragic friendship. It is so well-sewn together by a feel-good narrative by Morgon Freeman that it is impossible not to enjoy this film.9/10	9
Absolutely brilliant	Paris, France	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clich&eacute;s - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.	10
What a beautiful movie!	France	All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really Red. Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact.	10
one of my absolute favorites!	Boston, MA	This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once.  Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!	10
The absolute GREATEST movie of all time.	Hamilton, Ontario	My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, redemption, and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life.	10
Very Cool!!!	Chihuahua, Chih.	Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them The Woman In The Room, directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?	6
This is a film that you live, not watch	Manchester, England	To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't believe how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by, and I got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and you think the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.  The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better, things might change for us, and hope never dies. I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it away, because it's in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then it's true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.  This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).  This will live in my memories forever, not like the sorry cash-ins of movies.  This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film.	10
A Truly Uplifting Film	Fremont, California	Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone.	10
One word. Outstanding.	None	Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (Red) are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and Red is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in The Shawshank Redemption.	10
Those lil&acute; movies that...	Cancn, Mxico	This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life, your life! Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere.	10
The best movie ever?	Finland	Before watching Shawshank Redemption for the first time, I really didnt think much of it. I thought it had probably wrongfully earned the #1 spot here on IMDb, and couldnt be better than The Godfather for example. A movie that was cool to like, if you will. I could imagine fashion conscious movie-hipsters discussing movies over their glasses of Napa Valley Chardonnay, arguing who liked Shawshank Redemption the most, and which movie by Ingmar Bergman had the strongest metaphorical messages. You get the idea.Im sure everything I have to say about the way the movie has been made has been said better in one of the other comments. That said, the reason Im posting this review is because Shawshank Redemption isnt only a hardcore movie freaks wet dream. While its brilliantly written, has some of the most fluent acting I have seen and shows the fantastic directing skills of Frank Darabont, you really dont have to be an expert of film theory to appreciate it. It appeals to so many different groups of people, and so many different human feelings at the same time. The weaknesses it had as it came out (the idea of a jail movie not being compatible with the female population, and the idea of a movie about lifelong friendship between two men not being compatible with the male population) is actually the reason Shawshank Redemption is loved by nearly all: It offers something for everyone.In my opinion rating something 10/10 is a bit too absolute for anything, but since this is probably the best movie I remember seeing, and my first 10/10, I think Ill let it slide this time.	10
Emotionally Fulfilling	Melbourne, Australia	From the director of 1990s Buried Alive comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. The Shawshank Redemption is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabonts screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen Kings short novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. Hes a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that its a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary Red, the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (whatever you want) to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andys optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newmans music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.The Shawshank Redemption is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabonts brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. Were left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and thats what makes this story so great. The Shawshank Redemption comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood CinemaThe Shawshank Redemption was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film Ive ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newmans score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you cant go past The Shawshank Redemption.Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre	8

NOT just a prison movie	Collinsville, Illinois	A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who? Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan. Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect.	10
One of the best movies I have ever seen	Brhl, Germany	This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book, and I didn't liked it that much, but then I saw the movie. And that's a things that's never happened to me before, the movie was better than the book. It's the other way normally. But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie, it is great.	10
The greatest movie ever made and to be made	Bulgaria	The Shawshank Redemption is a story of life itself. It is not about a person in prison, it is about the soul and the battle it accepts and carries on to deserve the life it has been given by God. I watched the movie for the first time some months ago. That evening I was about to go out with some friends but out meeting was canceled and I had to stay home. Being unhappy about that, I started watching the movie on the TV just by chance, not knowing about its existence before that at all. At first I was skeptic, I admit that. But oh God, at the end of it I was screaming and jumping in my room at 1 AM! It gave me so much emotions and so much hope, I had never felt before that. I could hardly believe that a movie could make me feel that way - so excited, so happy about my life, leaving me believing so much in my own self. It is a great story of what the strength of your thoughts can make you do. In The Shawshank Redemption desire does not make you weak, just the opposite - gives you wings to fly away from fear, fly closer and closer to freedom. Morgan Freemans voice is just another advantage that makes the movie even more impressive. Tim Robbins act is just beyond perfection! I bought the DVD this summer and every time I feel weak or just bad about something, I watch the movie. It has become my personal shrink, making me feel strong enough anytime I watch it. Can never imagine a better movie made anywhere in the world even after 1000 years!	10
A Bit Over-Rated Perhaps, But Still A Good Movie With Great Performances From Freeman and Robbins	Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada	Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, The Shawshank Redemption alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as Red - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too easy - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think The Shawshank Redemption is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10.	7
Mystery	Canada	I still cant quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I dont get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freemans voice but hes telling us what were seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbinss psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesnt quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freemans humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.	7
Overrated and overthought	None	The movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but to be honest, the movie is also greatly overrated in many ways. I believe that the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of popularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous struggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense, and locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he keeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow inmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped where you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the thing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this aspect, and i understand it. But even though this movie, in my opinion does not have any flaws, it is still not perfect, and i do not think that it is the best, not flawed feature film ever made.	8
One of the Greatest Films of All Time.	United States	And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the films two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I cant speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.	10
For Everyone who Gave This Movie a 1	United States	I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I dont necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far Im concerned its mine to give, if I want to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I dont). I am just sick of people telling me that a movie cant be great because it was story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven movies, I certainly liked this one. So heres another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.	10
A true masterpiece for any film-goer.	United Kingdom	The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other great film, or any film for that matter has its pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of The Shawshank Redemption out-stands any other film film ever produced. I cant begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing. I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema.	9
Youll get it when you see it.	Rep. of Ireland	A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.Its an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. Id recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.	9
What a touching movie !	turkey	It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who dont expect anything from the life. And , they dont think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!	10
Richly human, uplifting	Topeka, KS	Deservedly ranked at the top of IMDbs all-time best 250 films ever.The casting is superb: Morgan Freeman is Red, a wise observer of people and an entrepreneur inmate whos made connections so he can get contraband to other inmates for a price; hes under a life sentence for murder. Tim Robbins is Andy, a smart banker and accounting whiz who was sentenced to 2 life terms for killing his wife and her lover (which he--like most other inmates, say theyre not guilty of). And Bob Gunton is Warden Norton who, when we first meet him, is touting the virtues of Bible reading and strict discipline. While, fortunately, Ive had no first hand experience, Shawshank certainly gives the feel of authenticity of prison life and its society.A long movie, most of it takes place inside a semi-corrupt state penitentiary in the late 1940s. Red, in talking his thoughts out loud to himself, becomes our narrator for many developments. As the story unfolds, increasingly we come to see Andy as a person with strong personal values which he upholds in the most difficult situations. And in Andys work for Warden Norton, we also increasingly find the warden as morally his opposite: selfish and fundamentally lacking decent moral character--all show and appearance and with no integrity, substance.In Roger Eberts first review (of his two) of this movie, he said: ....the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything....the word redemption is in the title for a reason.... Most viewers will agree.	10
I just love this movie	United States	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andys demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the films firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this films success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen Kings equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a films score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the films needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newmans score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable. http://howtogetridofacnequick.org	8
The epitome of cinematic	Karachi, Pakistan	The Shawshank Redemption is an aesthetic adaptation of a much repeated clich where theres a will, theres a way. It is a monumental piece of art that can chill, thrill, excite and rejoice any type of audience. It renders a remarkable story of hope, trust, courage, determination and friendship while at the same time exploring the not-so-pleasant themes of corruption and police brutality.It tells a story of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a banker who is falsely accused of murdering two people. It shows Andys prison life as he tries to adopt to his harsh surroundings while at the same time developing a close bond with an aging but active inmate (played by Morgan Freeman) and his comrades. As the story develops, Andy rises in popularity as the warden himself starts using Andy for his private business.The film offers a commendable soundtrack, brilliant cinematography and an astounding storyline. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceptional in their performances, moreover, Bob Gunton also gives a brilliant performance of the villainous warden.On the whole, this film offers its viewers a kind of emotional enlightenment, a kind which forces every viewer to reevaluate his stance on his life and goals. A must watch!10/10	10
A moving masterpiece.	United Kingdom	From the summary above which you will have seen, i stated the film to be a moving masterpiece. Right from the word go i was drawn into the films twisting emotional plot. It caught my attention that Frank Darabont has placed a small amount of aspects into the film that get the audience emotionally involved in which we base ourselves into simply putting our feet in one of the convicts shoes. Tt especially caught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks (James Whitmore) takes his own life, the non-diagetic sound adding to the other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the tragic loss of the character in which we have been following through the course of the film. The cinematography throughout the film was basic and what i would term as standard, seen before basic film camera-work. If this was better it would have highly improved the films overall watch. throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her lover. We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at Shawshank Prison. We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a nimble, lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden. This all becomes of the fact that in Dufresnes previous life he was a city banker, which is where he gets the nickname of wife murdering banker around the dim lit prison. Morgan Freeman also shows that he is one of the worlds leading role- modelling actors as he pulls of another supreme unique perform. The way he acts during the duration of the film is entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and performs single handed an outstanding performance.The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters getting into difficult situation and how they overcome them, or not.The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would term as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end. As suspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must watch!I generally dont watch films more than once or twice but this is a different story. It still amazes me to this day and still gets me moving every time, it also influences me a lot.If you havent watched this i highly recommend you do so!Joe Ferrari	6
Brilliant. Moved me in a way I never thought possible.	United States	Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didnt commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to give him a handshake. And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again.	10
Hope......Dont loose it at any cost	None	The Shawshank Redemption undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. The movie depicts how a four lettered word Hope brings wonders to our lives and makes something impossible to possible.Though the plot of the movie focuses on how Andy Dufrane, a falsely convicted prisoner gets out of the prison, the beauty of the movie lies in the characterization of Andy Dufrane (just amazing) and how he influences his fellow prisoner Red. The narration by Morgan Freeman in the role of Red is perhaps one of the best narrations i have ever come across. This story proves that the king of horrors, Stephen King, is equally good at any other genre of Story Writing(Hats off). The dialogues towards the end of the movie about hope are truly inspiring. The background score of the movie is excellent. Tom Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in the roles of Andy Dufrane and Red respectively.Didnt watch the movie??...go grab a DVD and watch it as soon as possible. Cant miss a movie like this....	10
Hope!!!	India	I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE  One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movies protagonist  hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.A must watch if you havent!!!	10
A gritty look at prison. One of the best prison movies ever.	United States	This movie Im not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really cant deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. Its one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel whats like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.4 stars out of 4	10
Rita Hayworth  the Shawshank Redemption	United Kingdom	I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didnt want to see it on video either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. Im not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards. Fortunately for me, this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didnt need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it, quite rightly, as IMDbs top ranked film.I dont care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case) is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can get things befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90s, then its time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say Watch this - its the best film ever made.	10
Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.	India	The Shawshank Redemption is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship  redemption that connects deeply with each  every one of us in some way. The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife  her illicit lover and is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison and covers his journey over the next two decades where he learns to adjust, makes new friends, finds himself useful to everyone in some sort  cleverly hides his fierce determination for freedom.Just like the movie, its entire cast delivers a relatively simple but very sincere  touching performance. Tim Robbins delves deep into his character of Andy Dufresne amazingly well  evolves him beautifully as the movie progresses. But if Robbins was at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andys friend who is also serving a life sentence  is notable amongst the inmates for smuggling goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us where he does an even better job. Their presence did overshadow the inputs of the rest of the cast but its never so extreme that viewers start rejecting the other characters lives outright.The Shawshank Redemption is Frank Darabonts debut film as a director  he just couldnt have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to each other throughout its runtime and yet it never looked dull or seemed to be dragging for a single moment. Cinematography is fluid in capturing the spiritless  monotonous existence of life inside prison. Editing steadily paces the gradual progression of Andys life, his friendship with Red,  his determination to not give in to the confines of the prison. And last but not the least, the score by Thomas Newman is pure poetry.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption mainly stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message that this film is trying to resonate is clear; Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. And that everything that has a beginning has an end, even sorrow  misery. Yes, the film seems all preachy n everything, but then if there has ever been a cinema that has earned this kind of right, its The Shawshank Redemption. Thoroughly Recommended.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com	6
This should be in everyones permanent collection.	Australia	I havent seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no problems giving this one top score.Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the elements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect form. Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys dont come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, This is just right! Buy this one for your home collection because youll definitely want to see it again.	10
Film surpasses the hype	United States	Weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. Weve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything thats been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, its the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bales Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. Its not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Jokers stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off. Thats how difficult of a role this was, and thats why Ledgers performance is so great.This isnt an action movie. Its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because its all in there.	10
Surpasses "Begins" in every aspect!!!	United States	Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy "The Dark Knight" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the "damsel-in-distress" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than "Begins" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than "Begins." The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008.	10
Best movie of 2008 hands down!	Netherlands	I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isnt just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his I will always be remembered movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you dont, then something beez wrongz with youz!	10
Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait	Melbourne, Australia	I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the Old Days of Burton and Nicholson. Instead were given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledgers performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than youd remember from any other film. Its impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why youre laughing.If Ledger wasnt enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gothams fallen White Knight and Batmans direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones portrayal look like childrens breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batmans conscience and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the majestic but unfinished tones of Begins - but it suits the films tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasnt quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasnt what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasnt) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isnt already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous Superhero adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isnt campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that couldve been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly wont regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (Ill wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you dont like it, then thats also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us wont take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Cant wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray!	10
The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted	SLC, UT	I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel Star Wars films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for Dark Knight.Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, Dark Knight ably stands on its own with or without Batman Begins. At a two and a half hour runtime, its definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. Its obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isnt easy. How exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the Batman animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in Batman Forever, he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts cant represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that weve seen just the prelude to the Dark Knights upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham Citys dark underside.The Dark Knight gets a solid 10 of 10 stars.	10
Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.	the big city	I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...?  It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary.	10
Batman at his best and beyond	United Kingdom	Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batmans struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to confront everything he believes and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madmans campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he cant see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels dont turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasnt made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen.	10
The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie	Memphis, Tennessee	(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Jokers plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledgers performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, dont ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledgers performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I dont think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10)	10
The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made	Australia	I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolans follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with Batman Begins. Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bales tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bales flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledgers Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batmans worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (Thankyou for Smoking) as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dents love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaals performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldmans Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfisters cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (Superman and X-Men are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolans flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!!	10
The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie	Chicago, Illinois	I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why Im writing this movie comment this late is because I didnt wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I cant stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to its hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batmans skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolsons performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like What are they, kidding?, once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! Im not going to compare Jack and Heaths performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heaths Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didnt know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that hes crazy, hes driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, whos previous film, Batman Begins, didnt really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know its not real, people dont dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains dont name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, hes inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and hes going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gothams mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the Classy Villain that Gotham needs, he also has brought a new thought into Batmans head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gothams White Knight trying to put all of Gothams scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyones going crazy over Heath Ledgers performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heaths and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I dont wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I cant come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. Ive seen it twice in one weekend, Im going to see it three times this upcoming week, I dont mind one bit. I cant wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10	10
The Dark Knight ---- Best Batman Movie Ever.	Australia	I have just come out of the Dark Curtain Screening for The Dark Knight in Adelaide, and Im blown away.Nolans directing is sublime, the pacing of the movie was so well kept, managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying Now how in the hell did they do that?!, Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I dont want to say much about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding its release, but its there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.9/10.	8
Heath Ledgers Dark and Brilliant Swan Song	London, England	I couldnt believe The Dark knight could live up to the hype. Thats perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasnt enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something well never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bales Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. The Dark Knight is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want.	10
A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions	New Zealand	Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What hes done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo!	9
Im sorry everyone, this is no masterpiece.	United States	** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, its quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledgers portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the films opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworlds combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldnt have been. Uneven scripting there.But thats nitpicking in comparison to the films greater faults. The ultimate reason why The Dark Knight falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: But its a movie! It doesnt have to be possible. I know, thanks. I agree, it doesnt have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as The Dark Knight wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they dont want this to be considered as a mere superhero movie, or action movie. Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys hes finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesnt work because The Jokers plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they arent smart enough to be effective as help. Its a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but cmon, he doesnt exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesnt have supernatural powers, so he shouldnt have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didnt notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.Id actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledgers performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but hes almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. Hes also a little bit stiff when hes in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in The Prestige was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in Thank You For Smoking. Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but thats not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but Ill spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such The Dark Knight succeeded in escaping the superhero movie label. But its not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes.	8
Batman just got really modern	United States	This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didnt feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks its brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second hes here and the next hes on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very clich&eacute; way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever?and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track peoples cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasnt as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set.	8
Lets be realistic.	Syracuse, NY, USA	I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just dont think they played them loudly. I dont like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didnt believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because its blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholsons output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burtons original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon.I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, lets say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250?	5
Best film ever? You must be batty!	United Kingdom	Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together.Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. Id have thought that a man of dents resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker.I really dont think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledgers performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation.The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didnt try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype.	4
Surprisingly incoherent and boring	United States	I dont think that in my quarter century of living Ive ever felt more disconnected from the pop-culture at large than after seeing this movie. With all the hype and uniform praise I thought beforehand that this is at least a solid piece of cinematic craft, maybe embellished slightly by Heath Ledgers unexpected death.Unfortunately, this movie is rock solid proof that sometimes mass delusion can strike an entire society at one time. There is absolutely no way that this film can be regarded not just as a masterpiece, but even as half-way decent.Lets get to the point. First - the plot. Its just unconvincing as a whole. Batman is basically a side character with little to do as he takes backseat on the Joker train. He whines incessantly about how no one needs him and how he needs to hang up his cape. Do it already! His troubled relationship with Rachel Dawes has zero chemistry and its hard to care about the outcome. The idea of Joker being an anarchist, goalless and malevolent force sounds good on paper, but it translates to aimlessness on the screen. Joker shows up out of nowhere seemingly with no one backing him and then... snap! It seems like the whole world is at his service. Not only he has no trouble hijacking a school bus (and then blending into a line of school buses after driving out of a half collapsed bank), hacking into the public TV feed or rigging an entire hospital with explosives; he apparently does it with such ease that the creators didnt feel the need to reveal a shred of information about how he did it. Many events in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example - what was the purpose of Lt. Gordon faking his death? And why did they make a point of showing the scene where his family is informed of the death - was that just to get the audience to buy into it as well? Thats just dumb and a waste of time. Why did Harvey Dent become evil all of a sudden? Sure he was badly burned, but he had to know the risks going into this business and he had a steely resolve just minutes prior. There are many other plot issues, but its pointless listing them all. They are there and easy to spot.The acting in the movie is a-OK, but most of the actors just dont have any good lines as their characters are irrelevant puppets. Heath Ledger is good for sure, but his take on the character gets tedious after a while - mostly from overexposure. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress, but shes just so wrong for the role. Shes a nice-girl-next-door type and as superficial as it sounds, its hard to believe that she would have two hotshots like Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne chasing after her. Christian Bale has zero material to work with and theyve turned Morgan Freeman into a moralizing nerd. Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Michael Caine do a decent job considering the script they were given to work with.The screenplay is atrocious, incongruent and messy. Its like the movie was cut-up into a thousand pieces of varying length, reshuffled and then strung together. There is no natural progression of events and subsequent scenes frequently befuddle. It takes a couple of minutes to figure out what the hell is going on or why should we care. Its just poorly done.For all the car chases, fight scenes, and giant explosions, the movie is just unforgivably boring. Its a combination stemming from a poor script, naive (or barely existent) plot, flat characters (that cant be remotely identified with much less loved or hated), and a general lack of good sense. There is also an annoying feeling that the creators had a rather low opinion of the viewers intelligence or maybe they just rushed the movie and had to come up with a lot of material in a little time, hence the low quality.Before I end this overlong diatribe, let me just mention three scenes that I absolutely cannot get over with in terms of their pointlessness and stupidity. 1. Batman is riding his wicked-cool motorcycle approaching an aftermath of a multi vehicle crash and accelerates aiming it straight at the Joker. What he is trying to accomplish is never explained. One thing certain is that at the last moment he veers right, barely avoiding the villain, and drives his bike without touching the brakes, straight into a wall. I mean he drives it into a wall (or overturned truck, cant remember) full speed like a blind man. Had he even chosen to hit the Joker, how the hell did he expect to stop? 2. This one actually occurs a couple of times at least. Batman leaps out of a 20th story window and falls onto the ground unharmed. Unharmed! He didnt have a parachute, a bungee cord, and he didnt even spread his cape on the way down. He just hit full blast and walked away. And on one occasion his squeeze Ms Dawes fell with him and experienced a similarly puzzling lack of after-effects. Filmmakers, needless to say, didnt find it prudent to even try to provide some explanation.3. Joker enters the hospital in a nurse uniform. That should present a logistical problem by itself, but OK. However, not only he seems to move around the hospital freely, he also does it still wearing his face paint. I mean the lower half his face is covered by a protective mask, but the rest is clearly visible. Whats even funnier is that Harvey Dent looks at Joker straight in the eyes and the face paint doesnt give him away until he takes of the mask. Is this a cartoon?	3
One of the Best Superhero movies EVER!!!!!!!	None	I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesnt, dont waste your time write bad reviews about this film.	10
very weak, unfortunately	Canada	Im very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, its as if theres no obstacles the characters couldnt overcome by snapping their fingers. Its just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didnt want to be bothered by realism and its one of the main reasons I didnt feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - its contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we dont see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesnt matter cause theres an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* The Joker starts with a small gang but in only a few days or so it seems he builds a big organization capable of operating rapidly without flaws - a group we are told made up of many schizos and psychos from Arkham Asylum, as if they had all been released all of a sudden to join him and moreover in doing so became hyperobedient and hypercompetent robbers / explosive experts / terrorists / etc. Yeah. Right. As if running a criminal organization made up of Arkham inmates would be a piece of cake. It would have been so much more REALISTIC and ENTERTAINING to see the Joker having to deal with nutty and sometimes incompetent henchmen and we the viewers doubting whether or not he would succeed and yet pulling it off and laughing all the way up to the last confrontation. Instead he surfs on the action, survives all kinds of explosions and crashes and moves around as if Gotham City was butter and he a hot knife. *YAWN* Second, the style & editing of the movie was mediocre at best. You would think the Jokers first meeting with the mob would have something of a tension. Here we are introduced to Batmans no.1 enemy and he tells them they have to kill the Dark Knight. But the way it was shot the scene was cold, he simply goes in, makes a few enemies and leaves. And next The Joker invites himself to Bruce Waynes party to kidnap Harvey Dent and he simply comes in, Voil&agrave;!, without facing any obstacles, theres no buildup, no dramatic crescendo, the pace stays the same, we get lots of quick shots, a constantly moving camera and even one or two 360 degrees around Joker and Rachel as if this was some kind of music video. Theres nothing, no tension. And it went downhill from there, like a typical dumb action movie. Explosion, car chase, car chase, explosion, fight, car chase, explosion. Cant you guys come up with something original? And those action scenes arent even well made. *YAWN* Why? After all you had an ace, The Joker, he should have had some cool crazy ideas to cause mayhem... but he didnt. He lacked the charisma that should be in such a character. Not that Ledger is bad but the character he plays has nothing special. Hes cold, predictable and not funny. In Tim Burtons movie the man isnt just some psycho killer, you know early in the movie hes going to do his crimes with style and that he has surprises in his bag. Hes a bit silly but you dont know what to expect from him - hes fun to watch. In TDK he neither has style nor surprises, HE JUST BLOWS THINGS UP WITH DETONATORS and hes not even having fun. Bbbooorrriiiinnnggg.I think a lot of people dont see all the big flaws of the movie because they like the characters and the themes. I like Batman, the lone vigilante fighting crime in his city and his struggle to retain his morality while confronting the worst criminals, I like Harvey Dents character and the Joker trying to turn Dent into a madman like him to ruin his crusade against crime and I liked the Joker trying to corrupt the people of Gotham and turn them into murderers ...BUT THE MOVIE SU CKS I really wanted TDK to be good, good at least like half of Batman Begins is, I wanted to leave the theater with a big smile on my face but I left the theater feeling cheated because I wanted to see a cool movie and I didnt, I saw a lame piece of crap. There was no climax, no great scenes, no drama, no tension, no substance, only over the top action scenes we have already seen elsewhere. This movie itself isnt a 1 out of 10 but Im so disappointed by it that it deserves its 1	1
Mediocre	United Kingdom	I completely fail to see how this movie could be considered, even at such an early stage The greatest movie of all time!Heath Ledger is pretty good in it, but not that good. It is a good performance, but essentially he is just playing a pretty generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker. Christian Bale is completely wooden in his role as Bruce Wayne, Batman is a minor character. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are there to lend credibility, but do very little. Aaron Eckhardt plays the rather bland Harvey Dent, but again, not a terrific performance.This is a ridiculous movie, based upon a ridiculous concept that takes itself so seriously that I found it painful to watch. The script is in parts cringe worthy. The plot is incoherent, there are no real character arcs, save for Harvey Dents and it is very poorly executed. The sonar imaging using Gothams 30 million mobile phones was a real jump the shark moment.The violence is extreme, especially when you consider Batman is essentially a childrens comic. The movie revels in sadism and extreme violence, shame on Christopher Nolan for the glorification of this.The art direction extends to a few Batman gadgets and some lo-fi emo make up on the Joker. No effort whatsoever was made to show Gotham as anything other than a generic American city.Glaring plot holes abound, from dogs chewing through the bat-suit where as bullets have no effect to Joker somehow being able to blow up an entire hospital despite giving prior warning! Joker describes himself as an agent of chaos who just does random things, yet everything he does is meticulously planned. The joker has no real sense of humour, he rarely ever smiles which is a total deviation from the comic character.This film - for me personally - signifies the death of the blockbuster. It might have made a vast amount of money at the box office, but i sets out to appeal to the lowest common denominator.The Dark Knight is a humourless, negative, sadistic movie with no substance to it, a weak script, which as one reviewer pointed out that for all the pseudo-intellectual monologues and pseudo- philosophical rambling just ended up with someone getting punched or shot.An immature film that should be for kids, but was really made for adults.I dont want to see it again, it was a waste of time. This is film as junk food, it is bad for the soul.	1
Fantastic!	United States	Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you havent seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. Ill just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie Ive ever seen	10
Why so happy? Lets put a frown on that face!	United States	I know this review will get a bunch of unhelpful votes but somebody has to tell the truth here! The Dark Knight is wildly overrated and is the most overrated movie of all time. Forget Titanic, Boondock Saints and King Kong(2005). This movie surpasses them when it comes to sheer hype. For the record I love Batman Begins. I thought it was a fresh beginning on a series that was rendered ineffective by that lunatic Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale fared well as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and the rest of the cast did a great job also. But this movie.... Everything that made Batman Begins so great is absent from this pretentious slop. Most of the cast look like theyd rather be somewhere else. Let me break it down this way with what stinks about this movie.The plot: Idiotic beyond belief. Joker(Heath Ledger) plans to kill city officials while playing childish games with Batman. Most of the time hes killing the people hes aligned with making him the most moronic villain in superhero movie history. Batman joins forces with Commissioner Gordon to stop him.The acting: Christian Bale is wooden in both roles(Batman and Bruce Wayne). He spends most of the movie looking like hes stoned out of his mind. And what is up with that voice? In Batman Begins he sounded cool like one of the gangsters from those old 1940s flicks. Here he sounds like Dirty Harry with strep throat. Aaron Eckhart is flat as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. While his Two-Face was better than Tommy Lees Two-Face looking good by default is never good. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman sleepwalk through this whole movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite awful as Rachel Dawes. Katie Holmes Rachel Dawes was a strong willed lawyer that fought for whats right. Maggies Rachel Dawes needs to grow up and find some better priorities. I agree that she is a step up from Katie Holmes but she plays Rachel Dawes like some silly high school girl with a pathetic crush on Bruce Wayne. The fact that we are asked to feel sympathy for her when The Joker captures her is a bit of a stretch. Her getting roasted made my day though lol!Now for the talk of the town: Heath Ledger as Joker. Heath Ledgers performance was okay but to say that he was better than Jack Nicholsons Joker is hilarious to say the least. Jack Nicholsons Joker had style, a plan and was pretty funny as well as unpredictable. Of course he was silly but he was fun. Heath Ledgers Joker is predictable with no back story and had no real plan. Just random acts of chaos. Ras Al Ghul had a plan, The Joker of Batman 1989 had a plan, The Penguin of Batman Returns had a plan. This weirdo had nothing but bluff. Plus hes has no fun with what he does and spends most of the time ridiculously philosophizing like those corny emo-goth kids that smoke copious amounts of cigarettes while yapping about the misery of their lives. You complete me? Thats about as cheesy as the Tumbler turning into a crappy motorcycle. Speaking of Emo-Goth kids that exactly what this Joker is. Only people actually find him cool instead of pathetic.Action sequences: predictable to a fault. Car chase and fights scenes plus they are quite unrealistic. People get punched, kicked, shot, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without bumps, bruises, cuts or blood. Now, Im not a gore hound but if you get shot or bitten by a dog, I would expect to see some blood. Not in the Dark Knight though. Pacing: The movie builds up a pace to slow it down after wards and with all the action on the screen the movie still finds time to be boring. Plus at 2 hours and 32 minutes this movie feels longer than it needs to be. Various subplots that never connect best describe most of this movie.Conclusion: The Dark Knight is the most overrated, most hypocritical, most pretentious piece of garbage in the history of cinema. The only people that would like this are the fanboys and I cant believe that people are trouncing Tim Burtons Batman movies to foam at the mouth like rabid dog groupies over this overcooked sequel. You pseudo-intellectual snobs dont seem to realize that those movies were great for the time they were made in and they were fun. Tim Burton made the type of Batman movie he wanted to make without trying to please these shills. I must have seen the Tim Burton Batman movies more times than I can count and still have a ball watching them till this day. I saw this dreck three times and still couldnt get into it. Its not even fun. Its a plodding mess that gets more hype than it deserves. Matter of fact, Ill tell how much I didnt like it. For months I had The Dark Knight on my computer for free via z-share and when my computer suffered from a virus that force me to erase the whole thing, this was the only movie through z-share that I never tried to get back. That should tell you everything you need to know about my feelings on this movie. Two Thumbs down.	1
Erm...really? (may be a couple of spoilers)	United Kingdom	Wow. Once again my faith in the rational persons ability to discriminate between depth and breadth, is verified, in that I have none.The film was long. Not deep. I think there is a misunderstanding. The film had the veneer of an epic film. It had all the right elements to be an epic comic-book adaptation to screen. Yet it faltered, mainly because everyone was so wrapped up in the idea of Ledger giving a career defining performance, they couldnt see past it. Its almost as if they accepted the brilliance of his performance before they entered the theatre, off of the back of the hype and the critics reviews, and all that was left was to actually watch it and be able to validate this belief.Disregarding Heath Ledgers untimely death, can you really say that he was a better Joker than Jack Nicholsons? I for one, cannot. Others have already said it; he had no back story. A character without a past and a motive - especially when they are a killer - is just not one that is appropriate to a story about good and evil. The things we like about villains is that we can relate to the reasons they do the things they do, whilst asking ourselves whether their reasons are justified. We get into a dialogue, and we ourselves get to decide who we side with - the good or the bad. This villain left me feeling flat and unfulfilled because he had no real motive, - making it impossible to choose which argument, good or bad, I sided with - and left me feeling like I was a voyeur, watching a guy kill loads of people.Everyone has been raving about the script, which I thought was plain dreadful at points. Others have raised the questions here. What was with his voice? He would make a great nursery nurse. The poignant moment on the boat when the sailor said something to the effect of They havent pushed the button yet, because we are still alive was just plain embarrassing. The fact that Batman kept leaving in the middle of a conversation became irritating instead of cool and enigmatic. Why cant he just hear someone out. And at the end when batman runs home like Charlie, I was nearly dying in laughter. I could hear the music Ive got a golden ticket. There were other embarrassing script moments, but because the film was so bad, I cant even be bothered to mention them. The phone device for one was utter...The rhetoric of the characters in their oratorical moments was again, limp. It was as if the writer had started a sadistic, flowing evil speech, but had not had the tools with which to really elaborate. Because he had decided to keep the Jokers background exclusive, the speeches were neither funny or scary. They were punctured and lacked conviction.The fact that this is the number one movie is embarrassing. IMDb should take it off out of principle. If this wins an Oscar, I will never watch a Hollywood movie again.	1
The Dark Knight Delivers	United States	The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bats crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime groups looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.The bad guys dont know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they dont really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Jokers personality is his motive. He doesnt care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.Ledgers performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, hes focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Jokers humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledgers Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films Ive ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again.	10
Not impressed	Maynooth, Ireland	I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didnt. Maybe I just dont get it? Im not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I dont like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isnt the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesnt like planning (because hes too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesnt, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like.Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long.On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didnt like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this.	4
Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie	United States	Oddly enough, I dont go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that itll be over-hyped and bloated; thats just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledgers unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isnt just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeares finest plays.Lets first get to what I didnt like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movies predecessor, Batman Begins. See, Ive always thought the complex Batman character should be someone whos consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know hes got this secret identity thing going, and he doesnt tell people everything, and thats nice. Endearing, even. But Bales inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that theres more than meets the eye. Bales Batman doesnt feel like hes consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, whos a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because shes smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we dont see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday theyll get it right.And then theres the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Joness performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and its like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart cant quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy whos better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dents a noble crusader, the district attorney whos going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll whos there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, youd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesnt seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! Its not over yet! What will happen next? But surely theres a way to do this without producing a film thats two and a half hours long. If youre going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruces conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because its supposed to be gloomy ol Gotham.So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. Its not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we dont even get clever plotting that we might expect from whats purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. Theres much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - thats forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger.	6
The Dark Nothing	eel, utah	This was one of the worst movies ever made. Never before have I witnessed a more confusing and convoluted mess. There were about ten subplots, but there was no main plot. The Joker existed to run amok and to represent the honest villain, that is, he didnt mess around and play games like most villains, and he didnt do it for money, he just killed and wreaked havoc for the heck of it... okay, thats fine. But in having the Joker purposely ruin all the other subplots involving other bad guys, it basically made all the energy in having to keep up with the subplots involving these other people come to nothing. It was very tiresome realizing that everything you witnessed, after two hours of non-story action and hammy performances, really didnt mean a thing, kind of like when a movie shows that its all a dream. It might as well have been a dream. Because in this complete mess of a film, nothing mattered. The Joker had no purpose - which was intentional. But since the rest of the movie had too much purpose, or rather, tried too hard to have all the purpose in the world - it all came together like a big explosion... then, nothing. Just ruins. And two and a half hours of my life wasted. As for Heath Ledger, he wasnt terrific. He wasnt amazing. He was horrible. Weak. Sounded like a nerd. And he claims to have studied from A Clockwork Orange (please!), but he seemed more like he was doing a Johnny Depp impression, being silly and androgynous. Its just such a mess of a film. Horrible, simply horrible. And the reason I havent mentioned Batman himself, is that he was so nothing, that there isnt anything to say about him. The main character seems more like a Vin Diseal character, and not a comic book hero. I understand trying to make the franchise more serious after being ruined by Joel Schumaker, but this film doesnt resemble a comic book in any way at all. It could have been a cop film, only the main cop had pointy ears, and the main villain had really bad makeup.	1
warning contains spoilers, OVERHYPE, NON-EVENT	london england	How can a film like this be ever compared to a film like the godfather is laughable, i am a big comic book and superhero fan i particularly like this genre but i did not like the way this was handled whatsoever..the following points highlight my case why batman is nothing but a okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION AND CREATION everyone knows that one of the most exciting things about villains is there creation, and how they became they way they are, i believe the original batman films which Tim Burton directed handled this brilliantly, but look at Spiderman 2 which has a great villain. There was no flashback even to the creation of the joker character we must believe he has been there all along, as well as Two Face whos original coming of being i liked better in batman forever, not to say i like tommy lee Jones character portrayal any better than this 1.2-VIOLENCE this film had left a bitter taste after viewing i am a fan of violent films but it can be seen the way this was edited to ensure the upper catorgory of a pg-13 12a(uk) over here left the film looking a feeling like something was missing. Instead of showing the conseqeunce of for example a bullet in the head the camera would cut away leaving it for the audience imagination, another example of not showing violence and actually changing the tone of the film was robocop the R rated version when compared against the X rated version which seems lighter in tone.3-BATMAN now Batman played by Bale one of my favourite actors opted for a stupid gruff sounding voice which didnt work, also the suit castes were terrible and i mean truly bad, batmans suit made him look like a more well equipped navy seal or something, not the true mysticism that is batman which is lost in this film. There is no reference to bats whatsoever throughout the duration. Another letdown was the fight sequences which even though Bale did a lot himself did not look smooth, or good on the big screen.4-PLOT/PACINGthe plot has to many twists and turns and leaves some of the less cerebral most likely lost(not myself of course). The pacing is bad as there is one key action sequence in the middle of the film which did blow me away but the film never lived up to that particular sequence which is a shame, less morality and preachyness more ACTION! and on that note a spoiler which i do warn before hand, the ending i must say i disliked a lot, for lack of realism, depth and completion as it is left very much open of what happens to the joker character, my 2 cents please reply if you have maybe a differing opinion to mine, Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest comic book translations to films, as in the earlier batmans, (including returns) but this should never be uttered in the same sentence as a film like the Godfather, which i believe to be one of the greatest of all time, the greatest which i do believe is Once upon A time in America.	1
Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water.	Hampshire, England	Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of soon-to-be-Batman Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: youre not The Devil, youre practise he hisses. The feelings that 2008s The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing ones very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist acts in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate post imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Jokers videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, whos under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldmans police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gothams white knight, suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batmans dark but is just different in technique and characteristics.Jokers parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gothams gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in sonar vision which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybodys linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down.	6
The film that seems to have fooled everyone!	United Kingdom	OK, lets get it out of the way, Im a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. Ive even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come Ive just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasnt that good. Its far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously its painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledgers performance. I had my doubts when I first heard whod theyd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked its burnt. Sure theres loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didnt give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. Its not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious?	6
Too many  fans seem to be blown away	United States	Many commenters said they were blown away, so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? Theres no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. Thats the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.Maybe Im beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? Im not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasnt (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in unexpecteds is trying to outdo the action mayhem.When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. Im not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but cant agree with so many who rate this film at the top.Its good and entertaining -- but too long. Its not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I dont mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom dont have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you wont be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment.	6
This is seriously the best movie ever made.&#xFEFF;	Turkey	This is one of the best Ive watched the movie trilogy. I dont see TDK just as a superhero comic book movie because screenplay was written in a perfect way. Created by Nolan Batsuit-mobile perfect design. The most beautiful thing in the film to return to The Jokers and Ledger as the Joker was created to be such an amazing acting. When good and evil sits down to have a talk like an interrogation scene, everyone in the audience shuts up and listens to what they have to say. Thats I think this movie is great. I just did not like the actor who portray the character of Rachel Dawes. Other than that Nolan and his team did a great job. They can make 100 movies but we will feel its something missing perfect acting, one of the best actors of all time nobody can be better than Ledger as the Joker.	10
This generation is too easily impressed.	None	This cold, jumbled, autistic, overproduced mess is seriously considered some kind of modern classic? What is there to say? Its just another big, dumb formulaic CGI action movie directed by another slick, boring Hollywood director. It takes a generation deficient enough in the cranial area to consider Pulp Fiction and The Matrix cornerstones of film to think that anything of artistic value can be gleaned from Nolan.Heath Ledger sticks out like a sore thumb because theres actually a sense of improvisation and life to his performance. I dont care what a clich it is, if anything salvages this film, its him. But he doesnt. We get Batman growling like a pubescent Solid Snake, poor pacing that gets you ready for the film to end like three times, tons of video game interludes--Im sorry, I mean tons of CGI--and a big, dumb car chase filled with hilarious one-liners like: not good. Ha ha ha ha! Because, because, thats understating a precarious predicament! Get it? Thats why its funny.Just more Hollywood trash.	1
Not Very Good	United States	I waited until the DVD came out and the initial media coverage had played out. This movie made money only due to the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. Throughout the movie I transitioned from when is this movie going to get good to when is this movie going to end.Christian Bale is a fine actor and we were able to see his talents in the first installment. He had very few scenes where the audience could see these talents in this movie. He was regulated to the Batman Costume and his Clint Eastwood voice impersonation. This was unfortunate. Heath Ledgers performance was good, but not award worthy. He kept sticking out his tongue while speaking to make his character look crazy. Gary Oldman has played much better bad guys in his day and Heath Ledgers performance does not match any of those or Jacks for that matter. Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine but her role was so limited that they could have pulled all her scenes from the movie and the plot would not have skipped a beat. She is a fine actress but we did not get to see much of those talents in this movie.Aaron Eckharts did an excellent job however his characters transformation into Two Face was rushed. It was kind of like they ran out of time and had to rush him into the bad guy role because they spent to much time elsewhere. I will probably check out the third installment when the time comes, but I hope they get back to the format of the first movie. They let the the actors do the work in that version vice putting all the emphasis the superhero & bad guy characters. If they are not going to let Christian Bale act then they can put anybody into the batman suite and it will not matter. This installment is also getting to the borderline where far fetched gadgets are concerned.Its unfortunate this movie made so much money as it will give the production team a false sense of accomplishment. If they repeat this performance they will bomb next time around unless they catch another break with another unfortunate off set tragedy.	4
Very Good, But Yikes, Lets Keep Things in Perspective	United States	Whatever else it may be, The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolans follow up to his Batman Begins, the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. Its full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and dont let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film cant possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and its through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledgers creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. Hes not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and its this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but its still, after all, a Batman movie, and its not the best film since Citizen Kane. Grade: A	8
Did you people see the same film I saw?	United Kingdom	Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Cant see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. Its a better film than this. Im not saying its not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....This may be the best Batman film weve seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesnt move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasnt a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasnt been hyped that much, so where is this coming from?	6
This movie was a joke...	Calgary, Canada	Cmon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledgers last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that Ive just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham, is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why cant Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a civilized manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesnt give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids, and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolans vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfmans theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out.	1
great but doesnt deserve to be compared with masterpieces	United States	Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who dont mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks...	7
Undescribable Perfection	Israel	Lets open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like Batman Begins expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be 152 minutes of pure awesomeness. Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Its anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isnt happy, but its flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batmans loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I havent mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batmans arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledgers acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and thats why it was so good. Its simply impossible to describe him: hes bold, insane, smart, twisted and hes so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I havent mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing Batman Begins will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Faces appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action.	10
Christopher Nolan masterpiece	None	This is one of the movies of all time. Theres action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. There also enough emotion to round out the experience. The joker is one of the best characters of all time. Hes truly amazing. R.I.P Mr. Heath ledger. Christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. Its truly a gift to watch them on screen. See this movie it will make you a better person.The ending is perfect and amazing. Every time I watch it pick up something new. There was a lot of effort put into this. Better than batman begins but not as good as inception. Its actually surprisingly under rated.	10
Wonderful. How superhero movies should be made!	Australia	Quite simply Dark Knight is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isnt a proper superhero movie, so lets forget about that).Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batmans enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isnt just a superhero movie. Its also a study of character, of good and of dark and of perception of society. I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that its not. Secondly, Batman doesnt do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, hes flying. Look at Spiderman, hes got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. Thats all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesnt have these abilities about him which are soooo unrealistic. So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batmans car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!I wont talk much about Heath Ledgers portrayal of the joker. Its definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. Hes just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!Everything in Dark Knight works. Its got so much novelty to it. Its a rare piece of cinema where prima facie its for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isnt for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special. Its cool Its original Its awesomeI cant believe how it wasnt nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him	10
I was disappointed by Batman Begins, was expecting the worst, and i got the best.	Hungary	First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important? Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre, and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off, cheap junk from the above mentioned category, and it was only Batman, who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place, but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex, interesting and remarkable character ever created.And to tell the truth, i wasnt entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series, check it out if you like Batman, well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay, but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time, but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one.Yes it has some overdone parts, some flaws here and there, a bit rushed and corny ending, but its good, meaningful, and Heath Ledger (who i disliked before i saw this) is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting, i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense, great acting, emotions, and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone. Especially for people, who think comic-books are sissy things for little children...	10
The best Batman film yet.	United Kingdom	One couldnt help be sceptical of the hype surrounding The Dark Knight before having seen it, scepticism was certainly weighing on my mind as i walked into the cinema. I couldnt help thinking is this going to be as amazing as expected, or is the hype just an inevitable reaction to the death of Heath Ledger? I can safely say to anyone still having not seen The Dark Knight; the hype wouldve been just as massive even if Ledger hadnt tragically overdosed during filming, The film is mind-blowingly amazing! The action sequences, The dialogue, the editing, the lighting, the costume, the score, the cinematography, The Ledger, The Bale, The Eckhart, The Freeman, The every-single-tiny-bit of cinema... is brilliant.Theres not the slightest whiff of the child-friendly-cinema that tore Tim Burtons vision apart all those (not many) years ago. Eckharts Dent/Two-Face, blows Tommy Lee Jones out of the metaphorical water, the only shame is that his performance will be overshadowed by Ledgers even better one, and indeed his tragic demise.Every insane laugh from Ledgers lips echoes with excellence, Jack Nicholson should be very very very proud. However, Ledgers delivery, commitment, presence and dress-wearing-ability far surpass the realms of merely paying homage to Nicholsons Joker. Nolan and Ledger really show Burton and Nicholson just how darkly immense the joker can be.Not to forget Bale, who brings his portrayal of Batman (and the barking voice it brings) to the next level, the depth and inner conflict create an excellent empathy effect on the audience and also create ridiculously good viewing.I could go on all day, going into every actors success, about how immense The Dark Knight is... but i think you probably get the message by now.As undoubtedly one of the most difficult films to bring to the public, a film so swamped with hype, tragedy, death and scandal; The Dark Knight could easily have been written off with the tragic death of Heath Ledger, we should thank God that it wasnt.	10
Bat-A-Man!	India	There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. Its his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but its a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! Thats why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath Joker Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batmans reach. And thats where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batmans life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when its required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batmans grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dents character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point Im making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says asta la vista and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! Its called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 &frac12; hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you wont mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies couldve been shorter and some lengthier but with The Dark Knight thats not the case. Its mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now Im expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier, Im a big fan of Batman and after this movie, Im mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while Im rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours!	10
Takes itself way too seriously	United States	Indulge me for a second here. Imagine that youre a studio executive, and someone is pitching the movie to you. And heres what he says: All right. My movies based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city. In it, theres going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died. And then theres going to be this other guy who, for no given reason, dresses up like a clown, acts creepy, and goes around killing people. The bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands. Meanwhile, theres this other guy whos a perfectly nice lawyer, but then his face gets burned, so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has. It sounds kind of funny and interesting to you, but just as youre accepting it, the person suddenly coughs under his breath, Oh yeah. And Im going to take it seriously like it was Shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience. Im not sure if thats exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went, but it seems to be a reasonable guess. Lets face it. The whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous. It could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved. And yet, its still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life, and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across. How does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective? What does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil? Why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie? Give me the days of Adam West. At least his show made me happy rather than depressed.	1
Just so...so bad	United States	It is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the Top 250. It is 2.5 hours of a coarse voice, explosions, cheap one liners, and terrible plot.Batman Begins, I thought was brilliant. It had genuine pathos, its characters were very believable and had depth to them. The acting was phenomenal.But this piece of crap, is completely the opposite. I have seen spaghetti westerns and childrens cartoons with better acting then The Dark Knight. With the exception of the Joker, by Ledger, who was decent.There is no screenplay. There are explosions. I think Michael Bay actually produced and directed this.There is a random side plot to Hong Kong that had no purpose or place in the story. The cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing I have ever seen in a film.The only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of Ledgers death. That plus the Batman and Joker fanboys that flood IMDb to give this crap a 10. They like how cool Joker was, and sided with him, and they feel bad for Ledger. A + B = in top 10 of IMDb.This movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time. It DOES deserve to be an example of a horrendously written, poorly shot, poorly lit, pathetic excuse of a movie.	1
A Plot in the Dark	United States	Why did I watch this movie? To observe the performance of the late Heath Ledger. It was not a disappointment but, like other reviewers, I think it was not one in a league with, say, John Huston in Chinatown or Bogart in The Treasure of Sierra Madre. It was more akin to Edward G. Robinson in Key Largo, not shabby, entertaining in a movie which is really not memorable at all. The noise of it would have been unbearable in a movie theater but I saw it at home and could control the sound level and fast-forward. Ive only seen a handful of movies that shouldnt have been over in ninety minutes and this one really didnt even have that much content. The dialog seemed to have been pieced together from the dead bodies of older scripts. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman grace any film by their acting abilities but I kept waiting for Christian Bale to say, Go on. Make my day. Monique Curnan was notable in her supporting role. The rest of the major players seemed to be phoning it in.	1
Am i the only one who thinks........Average?	Australia	OK now i was a big fan of Batman Begins, i really liked it but it wasnt really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for The Dark Knight.First of all, whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written, to be honest i dont see what everyone is raving about. Yes Heath was amazing, but it gets me thinking was this due to the script? Or heaths ability to understand and become a phycopath? If it really is the second, should we applaud it?Did it live up too all the Hype? Is Heath the only reason people went to see it? Is it the best film of the year? The answer to all these is of course..........no, and i dont understand why everyone is treating it like a god omg it was so amazing, best movie of the year, you see people this type of person is called a Hype Hound(by the way, thats copy written =]), a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film, and the first few reviews. Thats not to say there arent some true fans who really did love the movie, but Im sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didnt even like it Conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will, free will is for those who break through conformityAnyways guys my final words is, a great movie but not the greatest. Will Heath win an Oscar? Yes. Will it win Best Picture? Well lets just see	1
Not as good as most people would have you believe	United Kingdom	The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that Im not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot. Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), Im not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him. My inability to empathise with the characters wasnt helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker werent enough to keep the film going.As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadnt been as good as I was hoping it would be.	6
A Testament to the Stupidity of Our Times	Canada	Although suffering from a muddled plot, ill-defined characters, a typically uncharismatic performance by Christian Bale, and a lack of energy, The Dark Knight proved to be on of 2008s greatest commercial and critical successes.The fact that this film is in the Top Ten list tells me two things: 1) Most of the people who rated this highly are either 10-year-olds or adults with the attention span of 10-year-olds. I do not mean to offend all 10-year-olds, because there are some rare exceptions. But, you can catch my drift.2) People who rated this highly have not seen many of the other, better films on this list. They have nothing to compare The Dark Knight to.Anyway, I just hope this films current standing sinks down far below the 250 mark.	1
No worth the money	United States	My comments refer only to the 2008 USA release, aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 widescreen version (not the IMAX aspect ration 1.44 : 1, which could potentially be better)Sorry but the movie was AWFUL, Not worth the money! Special effects aside, gadgets, and the Batmobile which is a dream automobile, the movie runs 152 minutes too long, unnecessary ending, but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original Batman series or the comic books, neither in character, nor intent.Best of the movie is the director Christopher Nolan,his attention to detail and superb sequences,i.e: bus braking out of the bank, the capture and return of Lau (Chin Han), the explosion, and the capture of the Joker (Heath Ledger). The characters are very intense, especially The Joker, Bruce Wayne/Batman, & Harvey Dent/Two-Face. The best and worst of the actors, Ill start with the worse. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive, Sir Caine was the worst of the supporting characters, neither of the two were convincing, they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film. The best was Heath Ledger hands down, his performance was top-notch, consistent, but above all spectacular. There will be a sequel to Batman: The Dark Knight which sincerely hope will be better.	1
Not even the best movie of 2008.	United States	To start, I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather.This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledgers death had more of an impact on this movies critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bales obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw.The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. Its ridiculous.The best movie of 2008 is In Bruges, not TDK.	2
all you need to know is......	Texas	I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didnt. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so Ill skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesnt work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, abridged civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state.To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledgers Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stones Natuarl Born Killers than from anything that was ever written in a comic book.All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what Im talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie. Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didnt. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents clothing as they walked out.I dont blame the parents. This movies PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a Batman movie! With a PG13 rating! Batman originated from a childrens comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. Its not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits its not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didnt like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of comic book appeal in it anywhere, and it will take its place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest Id say this, thanks for the memories.	1
The Age of Commercialism	None	There is not really any reasonable explanation why there are so many junk movies with ratings over 8 in IMDb except the fact that unfortunately we are living in the age of materialism and total commercialism. Before mentioning anything about The Dark Knight itself I should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore, it was (and I hope it still is) art. If you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies (starting from the early 1900s) then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing, cinematography, acting and special effects are fascinating. They are modern, sincere, effective, touching. Thats where art starts and flourishes. However, if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects, deafening soundtrack, good looking actors, banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of Good vs Bad; well, here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system. The Dark Knight fits exactly the formula. Nothing more to say. To those who agree: There are still some great new movies coming out. It just takes time to find them. Dont be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films. To those who disagree: Well, consider watching Casablanca, Silence of the Lambs, Amadeus, Star Wars :p, etc? To those who dont take a side: Now is the time to do so. To Heath Ledger: You were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you. [17 June 2009]Later ... Here now as I watched the film for a second time so that I would be entirely fair in my judgment I realized that 8/10 is a fair rating BUT and only BUT when The Dark Knight is rated on a different scale such as Top movies based on a comics. And what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot, good vs evil, black and white characters, lots of action? The end. When a movie has nothing more to add - no fair character development/acting, no original twists in the chain of events, no unique directing techniques... then one cannot give it more than 5/10. And since the IMDb has a great image the only way users can help keeping it safe and sound is by taking a little more seriously their voting rights. [30 June 2009]	1
When they said Dark did they mean a coal mine at night	United States	I just rented this from Netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end. What a dreadful, boring yet expensive movie. It was so dimly lit, they could have had any of the thousands of out-of-work actors in Southern California in it with no perceptible difference. I guess a couple more explosions would have helped (not really). I only watched it cause of Heath Ledgers excellent performance in Brokeback Mountain. Boy, was I disappointed. I didnt care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end. At times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture.I just dont get what passes for great entertainment nowadays. I had to watch some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance, an odd combination. Its like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial. Dont bother.	1
Hyped and a little overrated, this is a good film but with many flaws	Netherlands	I think the hype around this movie makes people completely overrate it. OK Heath does a great job at the joker but the movie itself has many flaws: 1. The balance between good and badguy is all out of sync. Batman fades into the background, he also has way less dialog than the joker. This makes the movie unbalanced. I think they re-cut the movie after Heaths death, to put him in the foreground.2. The movie is tooooo long, this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes, its like they couldnt choose what to put in, so they just put all of it in! This gave me and some of my friends several *yawn* moments near the end.3. Gotham city looks like a normal city. In batman begins it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesnt, which is a shame really.4. The point of the movie, (i wont tell u what it is) but yes, this action movie tries to make a philosophical point. Of course this can be great, but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat.5. Lack of humor. An occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great, however the dialogs arnt very good and theyre never funny.6. The plot devices are really quite lame. I wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless, even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that. Somehow the movie doesnt manage to convince the audience of its own logic, probably cause there is none.All in all its a fun movie, with great performance by Heath as the joker, however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into. It doesnt deserve a place in the top 250, and it is not the best movie of 2008. Of course, if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you!	1
Why so much hype?	None	Okay, so they built a good villain in the Joker, but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together. Im not going to add any spoilers here, but if you want a big-budget, action- adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects... and dont mind plot-holes the Hindenburg could fly through, this film is for you. IMHO, this film doesnt deserve all the hype. Look at reviews from people who hated it and see why. Once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over-produced Hollywood crap, we should see ratings more in line with the films true value. I didnt walk out, but that was because I had such high expectations. Id hope to see this rated a 4, maybe even as high as a 6 by the average public. Im rating this a 1 to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype. This is, by no means, the best film of the summer... but in its favor, it does give better balance to the darkness of Batman. If it werent for the growing trend in bucking the old feel-good Hollywood ending routine... if it werent becoming clich&eacute; to kill off good guys and create characters with seeming hearts of gold, who turn half-evil, Id say this film had something unique; but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has depth... pffff... Save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see. Or go have a picnic with your loved ones. The alternative is two-and-a-half hours you wont get back; dont waste it to further enrich Warner Bros.	1
Hmm, the most overrated junk movie, I have seen in my whole life	None	This movie is a non-plot action-packed propaganda movie. Which wouldnt be so bad but the combination is such that it IS the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Seriously, when I came out of the movie theatre I was sick and angry at the same time. The whole movie is about approach towards the various kinds of villains, how they are and how they should be generally handled. You have about twenty propaganda lines, towards which each part of the film leads, those parts connected by a very feeble link. You could almost see the authors as they thought, hmm, we need to put this line into the movie, what circumstances will lead the hero or antihero to tell the audience this truth? Of course that made the movie a two hour drag where the twists and turns of fortune made you think if it wasnt a 10yr old child who wrote it. Ha, the setup worked we caught the Joker. Oh, Joker escaped, what are we gonna do? Then the good guys would realize that Joker wanted them to set up a trap, he wanted to be caught so as to get ..., escape and harm even more. Well, that is so childishly ridiculous, first surrealistic propaganda movie ever. So guys out there in the US remember. When you get spied through your cell phones, when your dear ones die in stead of a rich undercover agent, dont feel offended. Because to fight the crime or terrorism, we dont need the good heroes (those apparently end up as dead half-faced wackos). We need dark knights. Sorry for my bad English. I needed to get this off my chest. So much approval, 9.2 user rating here, 94% on rottentomatoes, are that many people so simple or so easily bought?	3
Just what Iexpected - Its a self-parody	Hungary	This movie has proved again, that cartoon means junk, and whatever you do starting from a cartoon, it will still be junk. At least now someone else in Hollywood realized this, and made a real good parody of the cartoon genre. An extra joke is, that all this was masked as a serious superhero cartoon movie. Just some of the best hidden jokes Ive found behind the clich&eacute; story:1. Batman kills at least a dozen of cops during the car chase, and makes some million $ worth of damage in the road, buildings. etc., but he is still the good guy. Sure.2. All the citizens in Gotham are totally stupid. First of all, they dont realize, that the only person, who has enough money to buy those hi-tech gadgets is Bruce Wayne, and nobody realizes, who Batman is. Second, it doesnt matter, that Batmans mask is covering only a small part of his face (his forehead and nose), they still dont realize, who is hiding behind the mask By the way, did you notice, that there is a face recognition software running on one of the monitors in Batmans hideout? The very same happened in the previous Batman franchise - looks like folks in Gotham didnt get any smarter in the past decades.3. Looking at the height of the pile, I guess that the amount of cash Joker is burning is more than there is in circulation in the whole world.4. All the mobs are stupid enough to keep their money in cash, so if they want to make a transfer, they have to hire a dozens of trucks. They havent ever heard about electronic money. If they are so stupid, then how they can run a syndicate?5. Some billion worth of hi-tech gadgets is hiding in the basement of Wayne company. For years in nobodys mind turned up the idea to find a customer and make some money of it. They just wasted some million $ into it, and later they decided to hide it.6. The way the bat car and the bat bike moves is totally unrealistic. Also, such vehicles would be totally unpractical. For example, why are the wheels of the bat car in the front of the vehicle? Anyone can shot it with a simple pistol (these are rubber wheels), and game is over. The stupid design of the vehicle is proved in one scene, when Joker immobilizes the car (supposedly worths some million$ + the development costs, as this is a prototype) with a common RPG, which costs only a handful of dollars.7. When they bring down the chopper with the steel cables, the two guys must have know in advance, that exactly where (which street and what height) the chopper will go through. Keep in mind, that according to the plot, all these Joker sidekicks are mentally retarded people. And doesnt matter, that the chase is half a dozen mile long, they are just in the exact time at the exact place.8. Hey terrorists and wannabe terrorists! I have some good news for you! It looks like, that if you want to kill a major, then all you have to do is to get an uniform. (An uniform can be bought in any costume shop, you dont even have to beat policemen and take away from them like in the movie.) Then you can approach the major to point blank distance - the only problem is, that there are oracles in the police, too, who can predict the future, and jump between you and the major even before you pull the trigger.9. Blowing a building is an easy process. High explosives are strange artifacts, as you can move and properly plant hundred kilos within a couple of minutes into the designated places of a building. Also, when you blow up a building, you can stay 10 meters away from it, and you will suffer no damage from debris, rubble and/or air pressure.10. Ship crews are incredibly dumb. They cant realize that there are hundreds of gasoline in the engine room. Or even if they have found it, then they may have thought, that the captain is going to throw a surprise party for the whole crew, and in the barrels there is the stuff necessary for such party (vaseline).These are just some quick random things I can remember, I dont want to waste much time commenting this disaster. Lets not talk about obvious plot holes, pointless violence, superfluous subplots, and Bale acting like a wood - oh my god, why that deep voice when dressed as Batman?	1
TDK, a solid superhero movie, nothing more	Netherlands	After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldnt wait to see this movie.Man was i disappointed.Dont get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i dont like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didnt like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i dont like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didnt see coming but loved it.All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, thats crazy.Its unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind dont rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.Happy to share my feel about this movie,Realkane	7
The Dark Mess	United Kingdom	Is this what now passes for entertainment? Can this really be compared for depth and breadth with other generally highly-rated movies such as the Godfather, Casablanca or even Star Wars? Many of the IMDb top movies deal with the good old battle between good and evil and the world-weariness of the hero or anti-hero, but this film lands far short of the mark in both character and plot development, not to mention script, acting, screenplay or any of the other attributes of a movie that might be worthy of commendation.The purity of the comic book origins of this piece are thoroughly distorted and turned into an incoherent muddle - almost any James Bond movie has a great deal more tension, humour, conviction and morality than this mess of a movie. On the other hand, if theres a serious message in The Dark Knight, I missed it, as I suspect will thousands of others. As a Batman flick, it simply doesnt deliver anything like the expectations; at yet another level as a post-9/11, human-condition, search-for-identity movie it also fails - however you want to see it, it fails on a grandiose scale.For some of who do not live in the in the US, The Dark Knight has the potential to appear as little more than an appalling piece of hyped-up propaganda for a moribund social policy that permits and legitimises evil, mayhem and general wrongdoing and unpleasantness on a colossal scale in the pursuit of defeating the threats against society.Ive had more fun at the cinema studying the architecture.	1
Do you have 0 rating as well??	India	I dont want to waste more time on writing the review for this stupid movie, as I have already wasted my precious time watching it! This movies is over-hyped. con, IMDb gives it 9.2?? I mean are you serious?? lol........really this is the biggest joke ever, that an awful movie like this gets 9.2??!!! Direction is mediocre. The hissing voice of batman is annoying. It was supposed to sound intimidating and macho, but it sounds as if he is having laryngitis, instead.Joker?? Was he really the joker (who never laughs??). A joker is a character, who is supposed to be full of surprises and tricks, and most important the one who laughs in paradoxical situations. Unfortunately, this joker was not even close to the actual joker character.It seems, as if joker controls the whole city, but how and when, God knows? I cant go without mentioning that hyper sonar machine, that can see every single person in the city. This time the director really jumped out of his briefs!! You evacuate all the hospitals in the city, except for the person for whom you are doing the evacuation!! lol........who was the writer?? I guess he didnt reach school higher than 2nd grade.I have so much to say about this stupid movie, but again, as I have already promised that even reviewing this stupid movie is wastage of time, so in the end, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, which paradoxically gets the best rating.	1
Are you people paid for rating this non-event a tener?	Hungary	This is the biggest ridicule after George W. not being able to spell the word nuclear right. It is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention. Batman, The Dark Knight is a piece of cake. With capital letters.OK, a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block. But no piece of trash has ever been so over-rated as this one is. I know that Heath Ledgers death came unexpected, and the guy was a solid actor, but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty. Cause however hard I am trying I am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give Christopher Nolans new embarrassment of an action flick six, seven, eight or nine points, let alone ten.This movie is lacking a consequent plot, a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough. Besides, I really dont know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched, but what I see is that Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhal and Gary Oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day - and probably the collection of money - in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen. Oh, and quite often I really got confused; from time to time I needed to be reminded I was not watching the new James Bond movie or Terminator CXXXVIII (the gadget scene, the plane escape scene are truly pathetic, as is the concept of (re)introducing the character of Two-Face, the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven).Since we are talking about a comic book adaptation I dont bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are (try wiring a town hospital with all that security and CCTV cameras they got installed, or try buying - unnoticed - the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky), but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details. Like when police forces storm the Hong Kong building to catch the bat-suit guy: Arigato, arigato!- they wave each other up the stairs. Does this mean China needs to hire law enforcement personnel from Japan? OK, I am stopping there. I know I might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers. This forgettable encounter with Batman however, reminds me again I am not one of them.	1
Seriously? SPOILER	Canada	OK I waited a really long time to actually see this movie.. mostly because of the hype.. I wanted to see if after all the long drawn out hype of Heath Ledgers death... its #1 spot on the IMDb boards.. and all the back and forth conversations on whether it or not it was the greatest film of all time... it could actually live up to that standing.The simple answer is no.1. Writing 6/10There are a lot of points in this film where the dialogue feels really rushed and just awkward. I dont understand why batman begins (which in my opinion far exceeds this film) could do everything right with the screenplay and this one fail so badly. The standard plot devices are there good/evil good as evil.. downfall of the hero.. redemption .. blah blah blah... its all been done before.. and I might add done much better. One quick film which comes to mind.. There will be blood used a very similar thesis of the antihero but did in a much more intelligent and beautiful way. 2. Visuals 7/10Yes there are a lot of very impressive effects in this movie.. the tractor flipping being one.. and the whole opening sequence.. but again where have we not seen any of this before in a michael bay project or hell even the die hard movies? There is no signature to the cinematography and nothing which sets it apart from any other big budget Hollywood movie. Id say the most stand out moment of the entire thing was seeing harvey dents face after the accident.3. Characters 2/10OK if hear a Batman talk like that again I swear im going to walk out of the theatre, What a horrible horrible disaster . Christian Bale sounded like he had one of his batarangs stuck in his throat. I dont know who decided on this plot device but it was a mistake. I dont remember any of this in Batman Begins and imo it really brought the project as a whole down. Heath Ledger was OK. Whenever an actor passes away prior to the release of his film of course there will be a strong tendency to have a biased opinion to how great he was. It really felt like he was overdoing it. If he took his acting down a notch I think his vision of the joker would have been much more believable. And possibly shooed him in for an Oscar nod. About the only really believable character in the film was Gary Oldmans Jim Gordon But than again anything he does his great.4. Overall 5/10A good action movie... But seriously overrated. 007 in a Bat Costume. PS#4 currently on the IMDb top100? Someones getting paid.	1
Unwatchable - only 1 sound guy?	Netherlands	Its not often I find a movie plain unwatchable, but that was the case with the Dark Knight. The reason is plain and simple: almost every dialog feels fake as only 1 person speaks per camera point. Like with cheap soaps where they can only take care of the sound of one person, or where the stars dont physically meet that much. The lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs, is bewildering. Staggering low-quality. I honestly found it unwatchable because of that, and whats even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill-produced production is considered a master piece by so many. I feel like the little child in The Emperors New Clothes. Whats going on here? Has everyone turned blind? Shockingly bad.	1
ridiculous rating	Netherlands	Another example of an over-hyped movie, but now in extreme. To say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous. Basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat-suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile, and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged. No humor in sight to make the movie better digestible.Big budget, good actors and some clever make-up artists are no guarantee for a good movie. In this case it resulted in a very boring one.As for the so-called performance of the year by Ledger; he is (was) a very good actor but this one-dimensional role is far from being special, but I guess the Oscar will be his, Nil nisi bonum.Why this movie should be on par with, or far better than true masterpieces like the Godfather 1&2 and Vertigo is beyond belief.	1
Too implausible and too dark, but not terrible	Brussels, Belgium	For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know its all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I dont mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so its possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a comic book movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events.- The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesnt seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all times- Has a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says.- The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once.- No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. - A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery.In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You dont care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good.I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating.	1
Too much of everything	Illinois	There were just too many subplots, too much violence, and it was at least a half hour too long. They should have taken some of the time they spent planning CGI effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes: 1. A witness pulls a gun out while hes on the witness stand? Excuse me?? This is some mythic land where the courthouses dont have metal detectors? 2. Theres a terrorist threat against a hospital, so they evacuate every patient--*except* the one whos been in all the papers.3. The police are transporting a high-profile prisoner, with dozens of vehicles escorting him and SWAT teams all over the place--but one trailer truck starts chasing them and theyre all helpless.4. The silliest thing of all--Batmans constant whispering. Its supposed to make him sound menacing, but he just sounds like he has laryngitis. Its like the old Superman TV show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on.I know Im way in the minority on this one, but I have to say this was the ugliest, stupidest movie Ive ever seen. I would have walked out if I werent trapped at the end of an aisle. You couldnt pay me enough to sit through it again.	1
I didnt like it! Oh! Heaven for offend!!!	midwest	There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? Its still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and theyre quite boring in the long run. Lets go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman hell never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. Im so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, theres the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. Its not entertaining, its not disturbing, its just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Lets talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. Thats really sad, and you know what else? Its all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before its release. sad. Really sad. I didnt like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still.	1
Who payed the critics	United States	I am deeply shocked. I am really shocked that this film made it all the way to the top. Its OK with me that it is a huge success at the box office. I can cope with it that many, many people do not have the same taste as me. Even though it is a little sad because I think this somewhat strange taste of the comic buffs will influence the movies in the future even more. There are interesting articles about the influence of the bloggers and hardcore fans on producers and directors. What really shocks me here is that many, many acclaimed critics fail to see how bad this movie is. They write about hidden stories, meanings and messages. The war in Iraq, the war against terrorism, a reflection of American society and so on. They write about hilarious performances of the actors. They write about stunning visual effects. Some of them may even write about the tremendous script. Fortunately so far I did not read anything about the scriptwriting. So I try to begin with that issue. Well, the script is so down, down, deep down below that I dont even know where I shall begin. I guess the guys who are more in the comic stuff will tell you that Jonathan Nolan really did a good job in adopting the stories and the mood of the comic books. But for me this is no reason to write a story that lacks everything and is so brain dead that Im gasping for air. The plot is annoying and predictable. The characters are written really poorly. First of all Harvey Dent. His turning into a fallen Angel is so incredibly incredible. It may result from the way that the brains of the comic buffs work. 9 Pictures or less per page. I that time you can turn from a white hero into a black devil. But this is a movie. And no 9c trash book. To say it clear  and you may have noticed  I am no comic fan. But I like for instance Sin City very much. It is a very good adaptation into a now medium. And it is visually very interesting. Visuals. As I said Sin City is visually very interesting. The dark Knight is not. Totally not. Almost two decades before we saw TerminatorII. Oh my god, this was something new. And Two Face  Aaron Eckhart looked a little like the wrecked Arni back then. Dont get me wrong the make up apartment did a very good job. It is just so sad that we already saw it all before. (Just like the inspection of the new weapons Is this a scene of one of the Bond Movies?) Or take the Matrix (Part1) about one decade before. Visually the dark knight is not one tick better or more interesting. Maybe on the same level. Sin City was something new. The dark Knight shows us common techniques in a slightly higher perfection. The directing is average. Not outstanding. It must have been a logistic masterpiece, OK. But we have seen it before. The acting. I cant even say if the actors are bad. I think it is the story that is so poor. The Joker is good. Heath Ledger is good. Not brilliant or something like that. It is solid work. And he is the only character that is somewhat interesting and not full of pathetic crap. Well to draw the conclusion again. I can live with it that this movie is that successful at the box office. I can not live with the super high praising comments of professional critics. For action entertainment this movie is too long. At least one hour is simply annoying. (Again the writing.) So, who ever has some bucks left go see this movie and see what brain damaged means.	1
If not the dark knight....then nothing	India	I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolans art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still havent seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for....	9
Not a good Batman film. Over-rated in the Extreme.	United States	damn i cant believe the reviews for this film. Ive only seen this twice and dont plan on seeing it again anytime soon, and this coming from a lifelong batman MOVIE fan (note the emphasis on MOVIE, not COMICS).Ive seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels, even the campy Schumacher ones. but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction. JUST because batman  robin was terrible and silly doesnt make Christopher Nolans films the comic book equivalent of the godfather or gone with the frigging wind. if anything, they only show how amazing Tim Burtons 2 original dual pictures are, and how utterly lame the Nolan ones are. not only is the dark knight worse then batman begins, its downright ridiculous! you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about. its like CSI meets Gotham city. you might as well call this movie GCPD or GCPD Blue, or any of those law and order-type shows that this movie seems to copy from. its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible. they seem to think if the story is engaging enough, we dont have to make the movie visually appealing. thats like saying if the story is good enough, we dont have to make batman look awesome in the comics.lets get this review started shall we? first, the joker. we are all familiar Im sure with jack Nicholsons classic portrayal from the original film. it was truly amazing, he made the character eerie, funny, and charming all at once. yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously. this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role. but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with Nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters arent really who they should be. first off, joker doesnt fall in a vat of acid like the original, he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green. i would hate to see his joker in the rain, he would look rather pathetic as a joker. i can guarantee that if Nicholson didnt already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film, fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with. oh, but since Nicholson already played THAT version to perfection, Nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that weve seen time and again. Heath didnt really even play the&#xFEFF; Joker, he played generic serial killer bad guy #13314. for those who would defend ledger by saying he was really scary and terrifying, sure ill give them that, but to say he was better than NICHOLSON?!? JACK FREAKING NICHOLSON?!? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE!!! The role was virtually MADE for the man when he was born.&#xFEFF; Nicholson captured the true essence of the Joker; a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing, but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs. THESE are traits that define the Joker, not some clich ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us. and that brings me to another point, whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo-philosophic rambling monologues? boy Nolan LOVES these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time, even in the last film. its laughable at how serious he takes the movie. did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film? Tim Burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality. its somewhere right in the middle. Nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city. it makes him look silly and out of place.Im not gonna dwell much on bales batman. this guy cant save any movie hes in. people seem to love this guy, or think hes some brilliant actor, but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his performance in this film. to quote Christopher walken from Batman Returns, hes just a poor schmo, who got lucky. his batman voice is ludicrous. ludicrous! i still dont understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over. every time he talks he makes me laugh. the only decently done things in this film is how Harvey dent is portrayed (pre-twoface) and the pretty nifty bat pod, that has ONE cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile. but again, the action scenes never pick up because of Nolans hard on for realism, so nothing in the new Batman films ever makes you go OOH Awesome for too long. this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end. they make it feel like the new Batmans are smart but honestly, in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out deep monologues? its so....meh. id rather watch jack Nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh. who can forget gems like bob, gun. today you have why so serious?. yeah thats what i want to know, why so serious Nolan?? why cant you make batman fun? nothing against having darkness, Burtons films were dark too but not so much to the point where they werent fun or exciting. again, disappointed.	1
gratuitous vileness	United States	One of the writers wanted it to be realistic? yer kidding..Could the joker realistically rig up all that stuff? ...cmon, maybe a bomb in a closet, but the characters mayhem seems very unlikely (hospital demolition was particularly overdone). And what a premise, ever been to a hospital? Full of hard working people helping sick and hurting folks, nice theme point to blow one full of innocent people up; Like i said gratuitous vileness, period. And could anyone understand what Batman was saying? So much of his dialog I replayed and even after several times, still couldnt make it out; perhaps all for the best.The movies set up -(of course to justify the conclusion), - is just all sort of contorted, irksome to this viewer. Another point of unbelieveability: when a person experiences really severe injuries, as one character did, how many scenes can you expect to play as a running around guy when you should actually be hanging by a thread in intensive care? We saw it on cable TV; did he perhaps turn super human during a commercial?Finally: does anyone know what becomes of our friend the Joker in the end? Maybe the TV version cut that out? It just sort of left him hanging.All in all, a pretty crumby premise, w/ whats become so overused and typical: sick motives, expressed by pathological plot themes and characters. Just more of the same sensationalism, like so much of todays action thriller stuff, nothing new here, just another film trying to out gross (and by that I mean: to be more grotesque, repulsively ugly or distorted and gruesome).For a viewer who enjoys action movies, or used to, from whats being produced now-a-days, - Im more inclined to pass them by and go for other genres. My recommendation: save your time and seek alternate entertainment to this gut wrenching tripe. Id say boycott it, and the stuff it imitates. Avoid it like you would trans fat and second hand smoke, it too will probably be found not not so good for us in the long run (exposure to sick minds carrying out sick motives. You can find entertainment alternatives that arent based on sicko themes!(and also, never try to do one of these reviews on an android, ouch.	1
Best movie ever made?	United Kingdom	If Heath Ledger deserved an Oscar for this then why didnt Mickey Rourke win one for Sin City? simple answer is Sin city is a film based on a comic book, whereas The Dark knight is some kind of post 9/11 view of the world in which terrorists like Osama oLedgers character go around blowing up buildings and sending the police and the worlds media videos or virals or what ever the hell those crappy scenes are supposed to represent in order to instill fear and panic nice one Nolan for ruining a comic book fantasy by trying to be Stanley Kubrick or whoever the hell you were trying to be with this movie, and I am getting fed up with people saying this is how Batman should be represented just read the comic books, wheres robin how the hell are they going to write the penguin or cat woman into the story it was okay with the joker because they just stole the look of James obars the crow and attached it to a caricature of certain terrorists that in the last 10 years have caused death and destruction and let a film go out to the worlds media every now and then just like the joker in this film to let everyone know there still around, I cant even describe how pretentious this piece of c**p is it was okay with batman begins but with this it seems as if Nolans made a serious political statement while using the guise of a comic book that was written in the 1930s. Personally I think the first Batman film despite its many flaws is still the only true representation of batman from Gotham city to the noir aspects and even the characters, Heath Ledgers joker is in no way comparable to the joker character Bob Kane created, and the way he played the joker was just irritating I just wanted to punch him out I found him not in the least bit scary or intimidating he just needed a good punch to the throat, if you want to check out some good performances of lunatics check out Dennis Hopper in Blue velvet Rutger Hauer in the hitcher or Gary Oldman in Leon who also happens to be the only good thing about this film, Christian bale is just c**p as Bruce Wayne and batman like he was the last time and like he is in every other movie he has made with the exception of American psycho in which he played a t**t basically just had to turn up to set and be himself. But just like the godfather this is just going to be another over hyped piece of garbage that people rave on about for the next thousand years or until some other film maker makes another batman film where he is this time played by a woman in space on a space station fighting Genghis khan because this is how far these movies are moving away from the source material this very film is based on. The film is disgusting to look at as well, at least Burton and Schumachers Gotham citys looked original (and yes I know he put the statue of liberty into batman forever but this film is just garbage) and not just like new york. They might as well as called this film heat as well seeing as it has so many shots of tall buildings in fact I might just go watch heat as it is a better made film without a pretentious plot and decent actors with a good script with well thought out direction and alarmingly a faster pace then this turgid piece of excrement, if you want my advice watch batman 1 then heat and then turn on the news after that and you will pretty much get the gist of the dark knight but in a more enjoyable way and wont have to sit through this demoralising piece of rubbish. If you happen to be below the age of thirteen or just a geek who cant get a girlfriend or boyfriend then you will probably think this film rules personally i think it is c**p	1
Basic entertainment - nothing more	Denmark	Im sorry but I dont get it. Why is everybody so crazy about this movie? Is it because of the effects? We have seen better, even in old movies. This one didnt impress me. Is it because of the story? We have seen better! The story and the characters in this movie seem to be taken from an old-days Disney fable. OK.. Is it because the actor who plays the Joker died in real life after finishing it? If thats the reason, why is that exciting? And anyway, then it has nothing to do with cinema itself! I admire the performance of the two main male actors: both Bale and Ledger play very well indeed, as usual. But unfortunately their job cant compensate for the flat performances of their colleagues, specially that of Maggie Gyllenhaal, nor for the many deficiencies of the script. The result is an unbalanced movie: the interactions between the characters is awkward, they move around in a world that doesnt seem to fit them. A bit predictable, a bit overloaded. For a movie to be a classic, it has to give you something, it has to make you grow and it has to grow in you. This movie is definitely not in this category.	1
This film does not belong in the top 10 Movies of all time.	United States	Firstly, I wish to say that I think The Dark Knight is a very good movie. As an average Batman fan, I think that this version of the Batman chronicles balances artful pathos with run-of-the-mill mainstream icons and themes.Secondly, my goal is to make a brief point that this film has no place in the top 10 movies of all time.Thirdly and lastly, in order to make my point, I would like you to review the top 10 list below.1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994) 455,891 2. 9.1 The Godfather (1972)372,101 3. 9.0 The Godfather: Part II (1974) 218,313 4. 8.9 Il buono,il brutto, il cattivo. (1966) 137,484 5. 8.9 Pulp Fiction (1994)372,926 6. 8.8 Schindlers List (1993) 247,064 7. 8.8 One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975) 190,056 8. 8.8 12 Angry Men (1957) 100,190 9. 8.8 The Dark Knight (2008) 403,372 10. 8.8 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)Now, ask yourself the question does The Dark Knight belong in this list? I do not think it does. My opinion: I do not think that the The Dark Knight meets the basic criteria of Character Development and story/plot/dialog quality. It is a 2 dimensional action film that wants to nick the surface of character development but fails to meet the challenge.	1
Cant believe this is still top 10	United States	People who know and study FILM will all have the same basic review of this MOVIE. Its overacted (and yes, Heath Ledger is included in that remark) and just an overall horrible script. The whole why so serious bit was again, overacted, and SO predictable. I wrote better dialogue when I was a toddler. Then comes the completely unfathomable events - Nolan wanted the movie to be realistic but he clearly is a moron for that statement because only pre-teens and people pretending to go along with the hype would believe the whole cell phone bomb inside a guys stomach. And a gun in court? COME ONE STOP INSULTING ME! The fact that this movie is ANYWHERE in the top 250 proves that people are generally stupid.	1
Really bad movie disguised (and not very well!) as a good one!	United States	THE DARK KNIGHT is ALL hype and no substance! Ive seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful. Basically, it is too long and convoluted as all get out. It felt 4 hours long to me the first time I saw it...no kidding! I guess the confusing part is worse than the long part. If a film flows smoothly for its run, length ought not be an issue, but TDK is utterly messy and confusing for its running time. So Nolan wants a REALISTIC version of BATMAN? Then explain SOME things to us! The big one is HOW DOES JOKER SET ALL THIS STUFF UP?At least BATMAN BEGINS was grounded in realism, explained motivations, techniques, and plans, and had a aura of realism. After BB was over, I remember thinking I LIKED THIS MOVIE! Although Im a Burton Batman fan, I admit that Nolan did a very good job with BB; it feasibly defined a realistic Batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value. And the plot made sense! But after TDK was over, my impression was WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Some points about why TDK is a weak film to me: *Harvey Dent swallows all that gasoline and isnt even sick enough to hurl! He is badly burned, but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the Bejesus out of anyone? NO ONE is shocked by the way he looks! Seriously, Nolan?*Gordon and Batman decide that Dent/TwoFace will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people. EXCEPT for them, Gordons family, and that bad cop Ramirez! Im sure they will ALL keep it a secret...Plothole! *Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes not attractive! Katie Holmes from BB wasnt jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but she WAS fairly easy on the eyes! And Holmes worked much better in this role in BB, had a LOT more chemistry with Bale, and had an important function to the story. When Joker says that she (Gyllenhalls Rachel) is a beautiful woman, I was like, NO SHES NOT! Gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than Holmes, but Holmes was actually much more right for the role of Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesnt cut it in TDK. *Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman, who just exists in this film, nothing else) has the ability to do ANYTHING technological? This includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in Gotham City simultaneously. Or did Bruce Wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it? Either way...OK. Yeah. Right. Whatever. In BB, the stuff Fox was selling Wayne at least seemed plausible. In TDK, it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble!*Batman and Joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly, chewed up by dogs, fall from multiple story buildings and dont even get hurt. When Batman saved Rachel, they fell from the penthouse of a CHICAGO high-rise for cripes sake. That must have been 100 stories easy! No bones broken, no trauma, just ho-hum, back to business.*That climactic ferry boat scene is pure de Hollywood manipulation! It is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like TDK is some kind of original, provocative piece. Instead, it comes across as sappy, maudlin, and empty. The ending to that scene is soooooo predictable! *In general, though, TDK is choppily edited, is populated with one-dimensional, lifeless characters, is humorless, convoluted as heck, has dull dialogue, and is VERY clich. I mean, its barely even a DECENT movie!Christian Bale was great in BB, but in TDK, Nolans hack direction and the script really let him down, making him look like a laughingstock as a hero. He was barely even in TDK and when he was in it, you didnt get any feel for the character so well-established in BB. What makes Bruce Wayne/Batman tick? What does he really want? Just based on one dinner where Dent spouts about being a crusader, Wayne thinks that hes THE ONE, the savior of Gotham City? Not very deep character development. In addition to Freeman, you have Michael Caine as Waynes butler/accomplice Alfred, Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, all giving rather lifeless performances. Ironically, I think Eckhart has the biggest male role in the film, but unfortunately Dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer. Really, Bale shares lead honors with Oldman, Eckhart, and Ledger; actually, Oldman and Eckhart may have bigger roles in this than Bale and Ledger! Who wants a Batman flick where neither Batman (the main hero) nor the Joker (the main villain) have the biggest role? These skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short-sighted character development.Tim Burtons surrealistic, neo-noir, skewed, artsy, comic book BATMAN flicks (BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS) are truly the best Batman movies. We accept at face value those films because Burtons unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie, but also succeeded in a way that Nolans films just cannot. Batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of Gotham?!. No way, not in superhero world, not acceptable! And I dont care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think!	1
more mainstream and overrated than Britney Spears...	Athens, Greece	I saw batman begins and liked it although at the beginning i had a negative feeling. For the dark knight i went to the movies with the greatest expectations, after the big commercial that followed heath ledgers death everyone seemed to have liked it.What a disappointment that was. The movie is not bad but the critics make me hate it. Seriously i think that there are some movies ine the top #250 that are overrated but this one takes the cake....From where i have to start? the action scenes are nothing spectacular, even tim burtons movie had better ones... The music doesnt fit at the most of the sequences theres a repetitive tired to death theme that makes in almost every sequence( thats the feeling i had ). Batmans voice is like robocop is talking or something like that its not even clear what he is saying in some points. I think it would be easier to say what i liked on this movie cause there are not many things i liked....Well heath ledgers acting was good although i think that jack nickolsons acting was more close to what i had in mind of joker character, more sarcastic and funny in a crazy way. Heath made a good bad guy but he is more serious than a joker should be, so why so serious?Avoid this movie there are a lot of better movies out there, its just a trendy hype that i hope in some years will fade away.	1
The worst film made by anyone, ever, at anytime	United States	There are no words that come to mind after seeing this film. Travesty, horrific, absurd, ridiculous, and mind-numbingly stupid all come to mind but none of &#x27;em quite describe just how awful this &#x22;film&#x22; really is. To see where everyone went wrong, let&#x27;s break it down!1. It takes 45 minutes until the actual plot begins to develop. By this time, the majority of viewers have fallen asleep or have taken their own lives.2. The actor who plays Rod, Alan Bagh. He makes me miss Nicholas Cage. NO NOT THE BEES!!! AHHHH!!!3. The birds. What do they do exactly? Nothing. The birds come down and fly directly in front of the victims face. Then they die for reasons only criminally insane director James Nguyen knows. God help us.4. Read my parental advisory5. &#x22;Hey I thought I told you to stand back. These birds are contaminated&#x22;6. What is wrong with Rod&#x27;s friend? And why can&#x27;t he get a good looking girlfriend?7. The dialogue. It&#x27;s like watching a poorly translated foreign film. &#x22;I like you and because you are pretty to me&#x22; &#x22;I thank you this words they make me happy&#x22; &#x22;Yaaaaaayyy...&#x22;8. This quote: &#x22;Why would birds do something like that? Why would they just attack&#x22; &#x22;......I don&#x27;t know&#x22;-------The good?1. Thank god for Whitney Moore in lingerie. The only believable thing about this movie was that she got a job at Victoria&#x27;s Secret.And that&#x27;s my review. Go see it. I guarantee you will never see a worse film.	1
A must-see movie.  Really. Im not kidding.	Raleigh, NC, USA	Don&#x27;t be fooled by the rating. You have to watch &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; at some point.This movies outshines &#x22;Troll 2&#x22; in every respect. It puts &#x22;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#x22; and &#x22;The Room&#x22; to shame. Imagine a movie that would be created solely to give film students a paper topic on how NOT to make movies. Every conceivable error has been made in making &#x22;Birdemic.&#x22; At first, you simply won&#x27;t be able to believe that the film is not a spoof. But if you read about the film and about Nguyen, and if you take a few moments to watch the additional material on the DVD, you will soon agree that this was just a misguided effort on the entire production team&#x27;s part.The sound is the most outstanding example of sheer incompetence. The director clearly understood what Foley is, since the gunshots have all been added post-production, but I guess they just didn&#x27;t have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.The acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn&#x27;t even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of camel-toe in at least one scene, but she&#x27;s the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is &#x22;give your financial backers a small part&#x22; bad.If you want to explain blocking, editing, framing, sound markers, continuity, reverse shots, and other film terms to your friends, this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.While the CGI (and I use the term in only the broadest sense) birds are hilarious, my favorite scene is the &#x22;retirement&#x22; scene. I think that the word &#x22;retirement&#x22; is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It&#x27;s hard to miss.BUT...it&#x27;s strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies, it&#x27;s not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can&#x27;t tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes (and there really aren&#x27;t that many) have some aspect (poor sound, hilariously unrealistic dialogue, odd things going on in the background) that fascinate. You&#x27;ll be giggling and poking your elbow into the side of the person beside you.So, go rent it. Really. You won&#x27;t regret it.	1
Unbearable	United States	Where does one start? How can you mentally digest something like Birdemic? I am still in shock. I have seen some shitty movies in my time. But Birdemic, friends and neighbors, is the worst movie in the history of film-making, on this planet or in any other dimension for that matter. It is bad, OMG, right off the scale on the shitometer. The acting? Poor Alan Bagh, is he a living, walking wooden plank? Special effects? I swear, the birds are cardboard cutouts dangling from strings. For some reason, they explode when they hit something. Why? Why is that? Can&#x27;t somebody explain, for freak&#x27;s sake?Everything stinks so very gaggingly. A rhesus monkey with a camcorder poking out of its arse would do better. Beware, my friends, beware of this abomination that is Birdemic.	1
a film for our times, for ALL times, or perhaps none at all....	United States	Sometimes there is a film that comes along that boggles the mind. You cannot believe the thing exists, but there it is, paddling its arms forward like a Special Olympics finalist (and no, this is not a joke on the Special Olympics - they&#x27;re too good for Birdemic: Shock and Terror). The movie tricks a viewer like yours truly; at first, having not seen anything made by its director, the inimitable James Nguyen - he has two other films to his credit, Replica and Julie and Jack, neither seen by me (just as well, one of whom gives its highest praise as &#x22;Ed Wood quality&#x22; on IMDb) - I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was really seeing, if it was either the highest or lowest of artistic expression.The film takes place in some sunny seaside community on the California coast - as we&#x27;re made PAINFULLY CLEAR in the opening from-the-car driving shots (immediately calling to mind the opening credits of Manos: The Hands of Fate) - and is about how Rod (Alan Bough) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who meet one day by chance, he a successful solar-panel salesman and she a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model (she just made the cover!) Oh, and there&#x27;s an almost inexplicable warning of a crazy-killer bird epidemic on the news, from, um, I guess it&#x27;s global warming. And after about a half hour of almost *nothing* going on between these two pieces of cardboard-as-actors, the birds finally arrive.... oh yes, how they arrive.What I mean by my uncertainty of what I was seeing, it felt like a double-edged sword. I kept thinking during the film, &#x27;either Nguyen is a total genius, crafting the most intentionally bad movie in recent memory, or he&#x27;s quite possible the most sickening hack you&#x27;ve never wanted to meet.&#x27; It&#x27;s one thing that the film was shot on a shitty camcorder. It&#x27;s another that the actors appear to be non-professionals or at best from community theater (Alan Bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed; Moore is too hot to have that happen, though her talent is just as nill).But it&#x27;s something else how absolutely, and surprisingly consistently, awful the film-making is. Even if you&#x27;ve never taken a class in proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing, Birdemic shines so mightily in its crap-ness. Scenes start and end without a proper marker, as if the editor didn&#x27;t know how to flow from one scene- one SHOT- to the next. Sound is completely mis-matched from one shot to the next. The music is the kind of synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive Bin-Laden out of his cave (they even go as far as to rip-off the John Lennon song &#x22;Imagine&#x22; for a girl character wearing a &#x22;Imagine Peace&#x22; shirt. And the birds... oh, boy, the birds (if you need further proof, watch the trailer, do yourself a favor and get it out of the way).Now, again, experiencing this film, especially in the case I had in a theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based on the trailer or the website or the claim by Nguyen to be a &#x22;Master of the Romantic Thriller&#x22; (Trademarked. I&#x27;m not kidding), that this is perhaps just a brilliant prank, a satire of epic proportions. Certainly the &#x22;message&#x22; part of the movie- and it&#x27;s wielded with such a sledgehammer it would make Stanley Kramer look like Jim Jarmusch - is done to such a ludicrous extent, with characters appearing for walk-on scenes like a Old-man Biologist who appears to explain that the birds were caused by man&#x27;s harm to the planet, or the &#x22;Tree-Man&#x22; in the woods who has a tree-house home and finds the birds don&#x27;t attack him because he&#x27;s in the woods and not out on the road like the rest of stupid man-animal civilization. Not to mention the rather *listen to us now* attitude of the main characters driving their hybrid cars and seeing An Inconvenient Truth (I s**t you not, this is in the movie) and their silly solar panels. Who ever heard of that working really well? All of this could, potentially, really be just a put-on of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen&#x27;s hand for pulling off such a feat. But, no, Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production, only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing &#x22;Springtime for Hitler&#x22; for the first time (if you need proof, look at this NY Times article quote: &#x22;I never went to film school,&#x22; Mr. Nguyen said. &#x22;But I did go to what you&#x27;d call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.&#x22;). I&#x27;ll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there, even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn&#x27;t get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.Oh, don&#x27;t get me wrong, Birdemic is absolutely, hysterically, historically, gloriously funny. It&#x27;s a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI (the birds just float, like a screensaver), and non-existent acting, and plot that... wait, what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either, or shots that match up? It&#x27;s so funny that I ended up feeling just a wee-bit guilty by the end. It&#x27;s easy to mock this movie, like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn&#x27;t an intentional anti-film, then it&#x27;s just a really bad Manos/Ed-Wood level movie, and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It&#x27;s not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room, After Last Season, and Severed Ways, it&#x27;s one of the real no-budget bad-movie finds of the past ten years. A must-see, for every wrong reason imaginable.	2
The worst movie of the decade and probably the most preachy	Las Vegas	I just got done watching Birdemic for the first time, I knew it was made on 10,000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. This same day I also watched The Happening and The Crawling Eye (MST3K version) so maybe I was feeling masochistic. This movie was all around bad in every aspect. It looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and it&#x27;s obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. I know that because the sound is very awful, the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right, and there&#x27;s way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. The worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices.The movie itself is very slow paced, the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. The problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters, not even vanilla more like tofu bland. We get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels, hybrid cars, global warming, and even the war in Iraq as much as he can. The script is almost a love letter to Al Gore. This feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about, his obsession with a greener world, and his dates.The second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. Lots of 2D computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. Somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. The couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van, this van has everything from handguns and two AK-47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo (I&#x27;m guessing the van has Game Genie,) as well as medical supplies, and anything the plot requires. Most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. The survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isn&#x27;t the eagles we should be afraid of, it&#x27;s global warming and mankind&#x27;s use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster.As far as the action goes, it&#x27;s about as lame as the trailer makes it look. When someone dies it&#x27;s just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. There&#x27;s also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them (even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the movie)who wants their gas, which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. There&#x27;s a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. At least companies like Troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity, over the top gore, and comedy. The people behind Birdemic have the worst CGI effects since the old Star Trek movies and long speeches about the environment. If you watch it, bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. Other than that it&#x27;s Duck Hunt: The Movie.	1
A joke, the worst film ever committed to celluloid	Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England	First of all, to approach &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22; with any kind of hope of witnessing a good feature film is utter lunacy. &#x22;Amateur&#x22; is a word a thousand times too generous for this film&#x27;s description. Even given its low budget of $10,000, the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel, the film is a joke. The acting is unspeakably bad, the &#x22;special&#x22; effects aren&#x27;t worth mentioning, the music is corny and inappropriate, and the film&#x27;s editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip-book.The only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that, a joke. The above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to. However, even this joke wears thin pretty quickly, and you&#x27;re left feeling quite empty, as if you&#x27;ve been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life.Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that it is the director James Nguyen who is having the last laugh, as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it. Perhaps the joke is on us, and the director&#x27;s intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy. Even so, absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is. It makes Battlefield Earth feel like Star Wars, and makes the special effects of 1933&#x27;s King Kong look like those of Avatar. It is, quite simply, the worst film ever committed to celluloid.Watching the trailer, I actually had a decent laugh, and thought it might be worth it. But having watched the finished product, the knowledge that somebody spent $10,000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating, and actually quite offensive. People were PAID to produce this. With MONEY. I still don&#x27;t believe it.	1
Birdemic - Making The Room look like an Academy Award winning film	United States	If you have any chance of seeing this movie, do everything in your power to do it. This is one of the best &#x22;so bad it&#x27;s funny&#x22; movies I have ever seen. I saw an encore presentation in L.A. and haven&#x27;t seen a room of people laughing so hard in my life. It simply has everything one could want. Bad CGI (the animated birds in the movie are actually GIFs!), horrific acting, drunken cinematography, you name it, this movie had it. I typically zone out when watching a funny bad movie, the plot will lull and some things will get boring. But NOT Birdemic! This movie seems to be specifically tailored to ensure you don&#x27;t get bored! Out of all the things this movie got wrong, keeping your eyes glued to the screen, they got right. Encore James! Encore! Put it this way, this movie is even worse than my sentence structure in this review. Do yourself a favor and SEE THIS MOVIE!	10
What a joke	Baltimore, Maryland USA	If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I was watching this dumpsterpiece movie with four friends, I would be bashing my head against something hard, and questioning the very usefulness of my life. In other words, yes, this movie was THAT bad. I&#x27;ve heard that Birdemic was supposed to be a very bad, very cheap rip off of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds, but Lord almighty! Fifteen minutes into it I was starting to panic.Rod (Alan Bagh), is a Silicon Valley software designer yuppie who has just made it big. Not to mention he always walks like he wears a back brace. He&#x27;s about to land a deal that will make him a millionaire, because this movie certainly won&#x27;t do that. Also, he drives my dream car (a Ford Mustang), and always drives about 20 mph below the speed limit. Have some respect, dude. But anyway, Rod goes into a diner and meets Natalie (Whitney Moore) by first asking &#x22;didn&#x27;t you go to high school with me?&#x22; Natalie is also a very hot blonde aspiring model, who just happens to give her phone number to a guy like Rod, whom she barely knows. That&#x27;s basically the first half of the movie, a romance blossoming. On top of that, there are stories about the ice caps melting, and swarms of eagles dying. Uh oh, does this mean Al Gore was right? One night, Rod and Natalie go to a cheap motel to have loving, but emotionless sex. All of a sudden, swarms of eagles are going around, swarming people, killing people, and blowing up houses by ramming into them like kamikaze pilots. Now, it&#x27;s up to this young couple to try to find survivors, and kill birds. Soon along the way, we meet Dr. Jones (Rick Camp), who tells us that we screwed up this planet, created global warming, and now birds are killing everybody.So .where to begin with this movie? First off, it has probably the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie that&#x27;s not a porno. I would say the acting was as wooden as Pinocchio, but Pinocchio actually DOES become a real boy at the end. There was no hope for this movie at all. I saw this being sold on blu ray for $25. I don&#x27;t even think this movie cost 25 cents to make! Just watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean. Everything about this movie sucked. The script was so badly written, it was almost a tragicomedy. At least Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds had robotic birds. Okay, the CGI buzzards that were attacking people, I think the editing machines in a public access TV studio are more sophisticated. Plus, there were a lot of underlying themes about global warming here. If these environmentalist screenwriters wanted to convince me to stop contributing to greenhouse gasses, they&#x27;re going to have to do better that Birdemic. I seriously hope the filmmakers weren&#x27;t taking this too seriously, because it&#x27;s such a joke.I love B rate movies, and I like playing &#x22;Mystery Science Theater 3000&#x2033; with them. But this movie made Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. Some of these lines are so awful: &#x22;Humans need to stop playing cowboys with nature.&#x22; When people were attacked by birds, they were more or less being attack by a Windows 3.1 screensaver. I would have made a better movie when I was in middle school. What else do I have to say? Just go online and watch the trailer, that will visualize everything. I&#x27;m all for cheap filmmaking, but this is just pushing it.I leave you with this thought. I mentioned earlier that I was watching this colostomy bag of a movie with four friends, where we made sarcastic remarks. My thought is maybe this is why bad movies are made, why Birdemic was made&#x96;to bring in more social gatherings.	1
really awful, but strangely entertaining	United States	Given that &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; has been blasted by many critics, I think I should say something positive about it to start off with. The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable, for one thing, and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma; also, anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.Less positive aspects of this film are legion, so much so that I&#x27;m reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 (in which case &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned, and perhaps a 4 for meaning well (though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham-handed manner)). Still, something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all ~ in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft ~ a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal (thus making the upcoming larger-budget sequel all the more intriguing).Yet, I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound, editing, writing, acting, direction and special effects, it might just be a forgettable homage to &#x22;The Birds its very flaws elevate (or should I say depress?) it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like &#x22;The Room&#x22; and &#x22;Manos: the Hands of Fate&#x22; ~ the legendary realm of films that are so bad they&#x27;re good. So, giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft, I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 (once it gathers the requisite number of votes).	1
Who needs a summary? Its Birdemic!	United States	This movie puts Puts Troll 2 to shame and rivals The Room... but I really think this one&#x27;s the best of the worst... ever.To truly enjoy this heap of hilarity, get yourself 5 or 6 friends with a 12 pack each of PBR and have a MOVIE NIGHT DRINKING GAME!Rules:1. Any time the camera pans, drink. 2. Any time the audio gets botched, drink. 3. Any time Rod walks unconvincingly (that&#x27;s right... you&#x27;ll know it when you see it), drink. 4. Any time birds explode, drink.Of course add your own rules, but sip small or you&#x27;ll be through all twelve of those cold ones in no time. Dear God this movie is fantastic.	10
If you put The Room, Troll 2 and The Birds in a bender	AR, United States	This is like &#x22;The Room&#x22; with mutant bird .gif&#x27;s. I understand its low budget, but wow. My guess is it was recored on an Insignia brand handy cam (the audio is poorly recorded. sometimes you can hear what their saying, sometimes not. but it doesn&#x27;t matter, you wont care). The acting is wooden and stagy at best, but I have to say it was great for a laugh. One of those surreal moments like when I first watched Troll 2 or The Room where you ask yourself &#x22;Is this really happening?&#x22;. The absurdity of the whole thing is priceless. Bring your buddies and have a laugh. Also, reading the comment titled &#x22;What is the Birdemic? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing&#x22; they have to be in the cast or crew, which is really pathetic. They comment on how much you care about the characters...you don&#x27;t! The girl would have pepper sprayed him and screamed &#x22;stalker!&#x22; within moments of meeting him. She&#x27;s a model who&#x27;s agency is in a strip mall next to a tobacco store. He makes a &#x22;big deal&#x22; by giving a customer half off, making a million dollars...last time I checked, two times a million is two million dollars...he lost his company two million dollars and he&#x27;s &#x22;WOOOO&#x22;ing? And this is all within the first 5 minutes of the movie. This is a monstrosity on film, but a fun monstrosity.	1
What the hell just happened to me?	United States	Potentially the worst movie ever. Troll 2? Pure genius compared to Birdemic. Manos? Well... maybe on par.I checked the Spoiler Warning box, but I seriously have no clue how this thing ended... A beach or something. It&#x27;s all very fuzzy to me. I literally went into this realizing it was going to be bad. Expecting it, and waiting for it. I had a discussion with a coworker, and we were reliving all of the fun BAD movies we&#x27;d watched as kids... Food of the Gods? Beyond Atlantis? Troll 2? All of them laughably bad, and just kinda fun to watch when you realized their stink going into it... This movie literally takes 45 minutes to get to any humor. Seemingly, the first 10 minutes are nothing but driving shots in Northern California. Then we&#x27;re treated to the two main characters getting to know one another, being successful in business, etc. It&#x27;s literally 45 minutes of useless back story.Once the birds get involved, there&#x27;s much to enjoy (nothing to move the rating from a one...). You know? I&#x27;m just going to fore go the review, and list my favorite parts (in no particular order):1) During their date, the stop for a moment to admire the birds landing in the trees... the birds look like they are moving in slow motion, and are our first glimpse into how bad the CGI is going to be... Bubo the Owl from Clash of the Titans looked infinitely more real...2) They meet up with random survivors in the hotel, and oddly enough these folks are armed with an M16, and a spare handgun. 3) They are driving down the road (in a supposedly war torn NoCal) supposedly &#x22;fighting off&#x22; the birds (none of which are in the picture), and they have the M16 and Pistol shooting out the window. There are PLENTY of other cars driving down the road... you have to wonder what these folks thought was going on!4) The birds are capable of explosion inducing dive bombs! They make the sound of a dive bomber from WWII movie, too... No, Really!5) MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE... People are stuck in a bus, and are being terrorized by the birds... our heroes pull in to save the day. They are facing the bus, and the birds are between the bus, and our heroes. What do the heroes do? Pull out their M16, and just start SPRAYING with NO REGARD. In the real world, both bird, and passenger would be dead... In Birdemic? Not so much. 6) The Tree Hugger... he hears a &#x22;mountain Lion&#x22; so he has to get back to his tree!In sum, this movie felt FAR longer than it actually was. Some movies are so bad, that they are enjoyable in a laughable way... This was actually so bad that it wasn&#x27;t good, it was just worse than you can imagine.	1
Schlock and Sputter	United States	Birdemic: Shock and Terror has made a splash in the underground community of masochists that enjoy atrocious cinema. With a tag line of &#x22;Why did the eagles and vultures attacked?&#x22; people have mistakenly believed this is the newest &#x22;so bad its good&#x22; title. As evidenced by the midnight screening I attended, these people are or will be very disappointed. The incompetence on display here is remarkable. Director James Nguyen has no idea of simply techniques like: writing a coherent story, including sound in every shot, knowing when to end shots, or incorporation of special effects. Nguyen is a Vietnamese immigrant and had no training of any kind in filmmaking. He was apparently inspired to create this film due to his affection for The Birds.The film opens with an extended driving sequence where the camera hovers at an odd angle for no reason. It is tilted slightly to the right for almost eight minutes before anything at all happens. It&#x27;s almost a loving homage to the opening of Manos: The Hands of Fate, which was also directed by someone who had no idea of how to make movies. After this unbearable sequence, we are introduced to the main character, Rod. He works for a technology company and has apparently earned stock options. He notifies us of his success about every ten minutes and uses it as a way to pick up an attractive fashion model named Natalie. This was the first role for both actors and they are so artificial in their delivery, it&#x27;s as if Nguyen told them to eliminate any emotion their characters should have experienced. Whitney Moore, who plays Natalie, appears to have a little bit of acting ability. She at least smiles sometimes.The first half of the movie contains no bird attacks. This is the &#x22;romantic&#x22; part of the movie, if you could call it such. Nguyen insists calling his movie a &#x22;romantic thriller&#x22; instead of a horror movie. For seemingly no reason at all, eagles and vultures interrupt the couple while they have sex without removing their clothes. These creatures are floating GIF images and hover over the screen. They are so poorly incorporated into the live action that they never actually give the presence of third dimensionality. They are stuck to the frame until the next scene begins. This is amusing for about five minutes and then becomes monotonous, not only because of the repetition of seeing the birds but also because a looping chirp plays whenever they are on screen. We later learn the birds are attacking because global warming has somehow affected them. I honestly cannot recall what the explanation was in detail because I had difficulty hearing it. Nguyen didn&#x27;t use anything to amplify dialog, so you will strain to hear what characters are saying most of the time.Birdemic is an unusually bad, bad movie. It&#x27;s a lack of imagination mixed with a lack of technical competence only made worse by a runtime of an hour and a half. If that wasn&#x27;t enough to ensure its infamy, promotional material listed it as &#x22;Bidemic&#x22;. It&#x27;s actually worse than the TV sequel to Hitchcock&#x27;s film that was later disowned by its director.Not Recommended	2
Top Forty Things I Took From Birdemic	United States	1. Angry birds do, in fact, drop bombs. Only, they explode. Literally. I&#x27;m not kidding.2. Shock and Terror? Check and Check.3. All film class&#x27;s first assignment should be a full length movie, such as Birdemic, so by the semester&#x27;s end you can see why you really did need the class.4. Make that, if Birdemic was your intro film, then go ahead and pay for the same course for another three semesters. Actually, just drop out.5. Repeating a 30sec music track in order to fill up a 4min opening credit screen does not deserve a &#x22;Music by&#x22; recognition.6. Sometimes 20-minute films that stem from a 2-minute idea can, sadly, be stretched to 90 minutes.7. If Hitchcock was resurrected to watch this remake: &#x27;Birds,&#x27; he&#x27;d only sue the people who brought him back.8. To close a $1,000,000 sales call, simply thank them for their business, hang up and smile.9. To persuade investors to give $10 million dollars, a one-slide PowerPoint presentation should seal the deal. Remember just to keep pointing at it for emphasis.10. Kids prefer HappyMeals&#x99; over seaweed. Go figure.11. Nintendo&#x27;s DuckHunt not only had better graphics, but actually produced more realistic birds (and guns) in &#x22;combat.&#x22;12. No real birds were harmed in the production. I repeat: No real birds&#x85;13. Al Gore not only changed his stance on GlobalWarming following Birdemic&#x27;s release, but he spit on Director/Writer Nguyen before converting to Republicanism.14. At least Tommy Wiseau&#x27;s The Room was trying to be funny. At least Piranha3D knew what kind of movie it was.15. As bad of actors that were in this feature, they must&#x27;ve learned something for acting scared of these &#x22;birds&#x22; that were as menacing as finches. 16. Sure, it&#x27;s billed as a Birds redux&#x85;it&#x27;s just as much a Beauty &#x26; the Beast remake: Just check out daughter, Nathalie and her monster of a mother. 17. At least M. Night does make the effort to edit something. 18. Twilight now seems surprisingly more romantic. 19. I don&#x27;t have the $10,000 budget this movie had, but if I did, I&#x27;d sooner risk it on one pull of a slot machine than what this movie would net. 20. My guess is: whenever the director yelled &#x22;Cut!&#x22; or &#x22;That&#x27;s a Wrap!&#x22; the actors, were seeing the connection to their future. 21. It&#x27;s sad when, while laughing as hard as possible at a movie, you still think this would have worked perfect&#x85;as a 15-second Family Guy cutaway. 22. SYFY Channel Productions is in the process of suing for deformation of character. 23. Wearing green does not equate going green. Heck, it&#x27;s not even a believable subliminal message. 24. Not all blame can be put upon the director. These actors did appear to be conscious. 25. $5/gallon for gas this summer? Ha! Call me when it becomes $100/gallon. 26. In a post-apocalyptic world, credit cards work just fine. 27. A movie about mysterious/unexplained &#x22;bird&#x22; attacks needs some time to get to that. The first 50 minutes out of 90 should be just the right about of time to watch people drive, turn left, fill up their gas tank, dance to a cruise-ship reject singer, fall in love in conjunction with making fake love in a motel, make one company rich enough to sell while simultaneously building another from scratch and land a Victoria Secret gig. 28. MST3k wouldn&#x27;t know where to begin. 29. If someone tries to steal your gas can, simply wait until they, without cause, begin walking backwards, from you and their own getaway car, so the &#x22;birds&#x22; can &#x22;ironically&#x22; take them out.30. Knocking off $1,000 off a $20,000 home solar panel is a steal. 31. Using two different Thai restaurant fronts in two simultaneous shots doesn&#x27;t just equate a mistake; it makes you stupid. 32. &#x22;And on with the traffic report: &#x27;Well, traffic is running smoothly on Cabrillo Highway, but make sure you watch out for tons of cars on the shoulder that contains what looks like moving dead people. No&#x85;heh&#x85;they&#x27;re not zombies, but even if they were, the couple with the toy guns should take care of them.&#x27;&#x22; 33. Find yourself under attack from &#x22;birds&#x22; but that darned tourist bus just isn&#x27;t holding up? Well, listen to a stranger and gather your thoughts in the fresh air, under the blue sky&#x85;in plain view of the very birds you&#x27;re trying to avoid. 34. If a &#x22;bird scientist&#x22; tells you to stand back, simply walk up to him and just ask him to talk. It will throw him so far off, he&#x27;ll have no choice in attempting to fill some plot holes in your movie. Unsuccessfully&#x85;but still. 35. Dialogue should never be plagiarized from Bazooka Joe Comics. 36. Sound effects and boom mics should be used to enhance the feature, not cause further ridicule. 37. These &#x22;birds&#x22; seem more bent on revenge than Jaws did in his fourth installment. 38. Long before Birdemic was made and someone asked the director when it was supposed to be made, his response should&#x27;ve been: The Day After Tomorrow&#x85;repeatedly. 39. &#x22;Why can&#x27;t we just give peace a chance?&#x22; is not a good movie quote in this weapon of mass destruction of a film that should&#x27;ve been dropped over the Taliban. 40. Dissecting this movie on every&#x85;single&#x85;flaw is only fruitless to anyone other than a film school teacher &#x96; believe me, it would take me HOURS to scrutinize everything wrong here. Instead: grab a beer or thirty, gather some friends and laugh away an hour and a half of purely hilarious entertainment.	1
utter crap.	United Kingdom	OK, first off i love bad movies. Hell of the living dead, birds of prey zombie 2,3,4,5 burial ground, nightmare city... OK you get the idea, so when I saw the trailer for birdemic I honestly HAD to see this movie. Finally I got a copy and sat down ready to laugh my ass off, instead I got bored, horribly horribly bored. Don&#x27;t believe the hype people, this movie IS NOT so bad its good, its utter f*****g rubbish. For over half an hour of tedium I sat there as talentless actor gets in car, talentless actor gets out of car, talentless actor described his successful career in sales, talentless actor preaches enivronmentalism.... then i switched it off. No killer birds, no laughs and i was not at any point entertained this movie was just a complete waste of time and the money used to make this garbage could have been used to feed starving children. If you want a cheesy killer bird movie, watch Rene cardone Jr&#x27;s Beaks (aka birds of prey) or if you want a great killer bird movie watch Hitchcock&#x27;s classic the birds, just avoid this like the plague, watching it makes you stupid and the director makes uwe boll look talented.	1
This movie saved my life	New York	I was in a coma, I couldn&#x27;t have kids and my wife was dead. This movie was played in my hospital room. As the end credits began to roll (and didn&#x27;t finish for three hours) two healthy baby boys, Rod and Nathalie, sprung forth from my tummy. I was then awakened from my coma, jumped from my bed (children in my arms) and proceeded to fly out of the hospital room with the swiftness of 1000 birds. I flew to my wife&#x27;s grave and promptly resurrected her. I then, in turn, saved an orphan run bank from a fire. I adopted all 44 orphans and named them all after the characters in this wonderful film (I have the same number of children as there are actors in the film, but because I needed that number I did not adopt two of the orphans). Then I took my wife and children and we mimicked the lifestyle of my favorite character from the film, Tree Hugger. All in all I&#x27;d give this movie 10 stars and my left foot. If I could I would sell my children into slavery in order to watch this movie again having never seen it before.	10
Definitely on the best of the worst list	United States	Let&#x27;s be honest, if you even got as far as reading this review, then you&#x27;re not looking for a good movie, so there&#x27;s a good chance Birdemic is the movie for you. On the other hand, let me give you some practical advice; just start the movie at minute 47, because nothing of any real importance happens in the first half. It&#x27;s entirely spent establishing an implausible relationship between a Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a hot fashion model and a Rod (Alan Bagh), computer geek. I know this sort of thing is a staple in horror and sci fi movies, but usually the nerd has some hidden charms. Rod is basically just annoying and full of himself. Also, the relationship normally develops in the context of the plot and involves at least *some* dramatic tension. In this case, they meet and she is immediately swept off her feet by his complete lack of charm and affected speech patterns. Oh yeah, he&#x27;s also just landed a big business deal that will make him a millionaire. So much more Nathalie&#x27;s wholesome image, the little gold digger! Anyway, this whole process takes about 5 minutes. Where the other 40 go is a mystery. OK, they do find one dead bird on the beach. Consider yourself foreshadowed.On second thought, start at minute 44 to catch the movie&#x27;s only redeeming feature: a gratuitous slow pan of Moore in her underwear. But then *immediately* jump to minute 47 to escape the most awkward and unconvincing love scene in the history of cinema. Don&#x27;t say you haven&#x27;t been warned.Then the action starts. After a night of passion, they awake to a full scale attack by badly rendered CGI birds which terrorize people and occasionally dive bomb the ground, exploding on impact. I don&#x27;t mean they burst apart in a shower of bird guts; I mean they actually explode, with fire and smoke, like little Kamikazee pilots! This is never explained.And that&#x27;s pretty much it. The rest of the movie is basically spent running from these birds and occasionally fighting them off - first with coat hangers and later with the the stash of firearms and (almost) limitless ammo that one character inexplicably produces. Sometimes there&#x27;s a variation on the explosion theme where the birds splatter people with something that appears to burn them like acid. They run into a couple of people in their travels who explain this is all caused by global warming. This shameless pandering to social relevance loses any sympathy the film maker might otherwise have had. Also, I can believe that climate change might make birds aggressive, but could it really make them explode?Just how bad an actor is Alan Bagh? Well, it should tell you something that he couldn&#x27;t project any credible passion in a love scene with our scantily clad heroine. His dialog is delivered in a uniform stilted monotone, and he seems to avoid eye contact with either the camera or any of his fellow actors. In fact, even the scenes when he and Moore are walking in silence - and there are an annoyingly large number of these - are somehow not at all believable. I mean seriously, how hard is it to *walk* in a convincing manner? If I saw someone walking like that on the street, I would assume he had suffered some sort of head trauma.Almost all of the actors are more or less equivalent to Bagh, with the arguable exception of Moore. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, she&#x27;s not great, but since she&#x27;s the only person in the movie with any acting ability whatsoever, she comes across like Merryl Streep. Really, you find yourself longing for her speaking parts, because it&#x27;s the only dialog that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t literally make you cringe. Also, did I mention she&#x27;s got a gratuitous underwear scene at minute 44?A lot has been said about the poor quality of the CGI birds, but nothing can prepare you for how bad they really are. If Ed Wood had made this movie, he would have interspersed stock footage of flocks of birds with stuffed birds thrown in from off screen - and the result would have been much, much more effective!Anyway, since they&#x27;re worried about bird attacks, you would think they would, I don&#x27;t know, stay indoors! By no, they&#x27;re outside as much as possible. Part of this is because in the one day since the birds attacked civilization has completely crumbled, and they&#x27;re forced to forage for food. Just when you&#x27;re continuing to wonder how they&#x27;re going to end this this thing, the birds simply fly away, with no explanation. Huh?Truly, a masterpiece.	1
Bad as bad is bad	Brisbane, Australia	Every now and again, I read a review on this site of a film where the person says things like, &#x22;it&#x27;s the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen!&#x22;, when it might indeed be pretty ordinary, but not really one star basis. My thought is usually, &#x22;You really don&#x27;t know what &#x27;bad&#x27; is, do you?&#x22; &#x22;Birdemic: Shock And Terror&#x22; is bad. It is as bad as what people say it is. It is almost unbelievably bad, and I can believe a lot. It is gobsmackingly awful - this coming from a fan of Ed Wood.Rod and Nathalie are two former schoolmates who happen to come across each other, and proceed to fall in love, also happening to find out that they just happen to have neutral fans who also just happen to be in love.Nothing occurs in the first half of the film. Nothing. After the opening credits, where a tinny tune is played on a continuous loop, we are treated to deadening acting (although, in defense, Whitney Moore isn&#x27;t too bad), atrocious dialogue, horrible sound and dreadful editing. This all makes it vastly entertaining, for those who are fascinated by such ineptness.After this first half of routine and dreadful drama, the birds start attacking. Just like that. There are a couple of references to strange things happening in nature earlier but, really, it could have all just been a &#x27;straight&#x27; (so to speak) love story beforehand.It could be that filmmaker James Nguyen, a self-proclaimed Hitchcock fan, tried to take a leaf out of the Master&#x27;s book here, where Hitch sometimes had his thrillers trundle along in an unalarming way for a while until, almost casually, things would start to happen and, before we knew it, the thrills were on.The difference is, of course, that Hitchcock did it with style, wit and panache.To say the birds attack is a very loose statement. In reality, they are superimposed on the screen, bouncing up and down, while the actors wave various articles at them. When one thinks about it, this is not really very surprising. If a scene of two people talking in a restaurant can&#x27;t be handled above the level of complete incompetence, how could we expect more from the special effects later? As we go on, our heroes fire guns, with unlimited ammunition, at the birds, while driving around aimlessly, trying to help others, including picking up two children.These children have just seen their mother killed by the birds. And yet, before long, they&#x27;re sitting in the back seat of the car playing computer games, and demanding Happy Meals! Other people get killed by birds suddenly flying past them, and seeming to clip them with their beaks or claws, which is enough to drop them on the spot.And the ending. The ending... It&#x27;s utter meaninglessness suits the film perfectly. As someone who is fascinated by true badness (not just in movies), &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; transcends such things for me. Everything that could possibly be wrong in filmmaking (again, with the possible exception of Moore) is on display here. Everything. Maybe one day, Tim Burton will do a sequel to &#x22;Ed Wood&#x22; and call it &#x22;James Nguyen&#x22;, although it would be harder to pronounce. But surely it would be worth the admission price.	1
Where Do I Start?	United States	I don&#x27;t know where to begin, so I&#x27;ll say this. I&#x27;ve heard The Room reviewed as the &#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22; of bad movies. After watching Birdemic: Shock and Terror, The Room will actually seem as good as Citizen Kane.Birdemic: Shock and Terror is a cult film waiting to happen. The low budget, the amateur cast and crew, the goofy, hole-ridden plot, but what this movie has that classic cult films like The Room and Troll 2 for example don&#x27;t, is a complete ineptitude from the standpoint of all involved in this movie. I could watch Troll 2 and The Room, and I could picture in some alternate dimension that everything that was wrong with those movies was tweaked and they actually weren&#x27;t half bad, but Birdemic: Shock and Terror is different.First of all, the editing in this movie is worse than your average high schooler&#x27;s film studies project. Almost every perspective change in a scene is accompanied with a long, awkward pause and an obvious change in sound, even on the television. I&#x27;m pretty sure the director/producer/writer of this atrocity (James Nguyen) just used the built-in mic on his digital camcorder. Also, every scene is shot with a pan to the right. Believe it or not though, if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ll give credit to in this film, is the music. It&#x27;s actually decent, considering the small budget. The song played during the (awful) bar scene comes to mind because it&#x27;s really catchy and actually has some really good musicianship. However, the film score is often repeated, and in the case of the beginning credits, is obnoxiously repeated.Next, the plot and writing. If you haven&#x27;t seen the movie, the plot is that an aspiring software salesman meets a girl and they hit it off, only to have their wonderful love be cut short by killer birds. The plot is somewhat coherent, as it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out what&#x27;s going on with the love story, and it&#x27;s also pretty clear &#x22;why did the eagles and vultures attacked&#x22; (quoting a movie flier made by Nguyen himself). Thankfully, there aren&#x27;t any subplots in the movie, unless you count the career ventures the characters make pretty early in the movie, which brings me to the writing.In the pile of steaming crap that is this movie, this has to be the smelliest part. Nguyen was inspired by two movies supposedly: Hitchcock&#x27;s &#x22;The Birds&#x22; and Al Gore&#x27;s &#x22;An Inconvenient Truth.&#x22; I read about that before I watched the movie, and I had a hard time thinking how those two could be combined, then I watched this film. The most out of place, out of context plugs for unrealistic &#x22;green&#x22; technology (absurdly cheap solar panels, 100 mpg Ford Mustang) can are uttered in this movie to the point where it&#x27;s almost offensive. This is a part of the movie that you need to see to believe because I&#x27;d easily be over the word limit if I had to describe all these scenes.Finally, we&#x27;ll talk about the acting. There&#x27;s not much to say here, except that they aren&#x27;t good actors. Thankfully, we don&#x27;t see awkward characters or overacting like in other bad films that have acquired cult rating, but we do see bad actors nonetheless. I honestly don&#x27;t feel like I can make a true judgement of their acting because of the terrible script and editing, but I can only imagine what I&#x27;d think if I got a &#x22;true&#x22; performance from them. If I had to pick the top 3 actors in this film, I&#x27;d pick the &#x22;tree-hugger,&#x22; Nathalie, and the nightclub singer.Basically, I suggest you watch this movie. This is probably the worst feature-length film of all time, and I&#x27;ve seen some bad films.	1
A Must-See Comedy!!!	United States	OK, yes this movie is terrible, but it&#x27;s still enjoyable. It&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s good!! If you&#x27;re the kind of person who can appreciate movies like Troll 2 and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, then you&#x27;ll love this movie. There&#x27;s so many things to make fun of; the terrible acting, the weak plot, the locations, the sound equipment and goofy CGI effects are all worth a look. This movie is so bad, it&#x27;s good! Seriously!! If you want a good time, get some snacks and buddies and watch this movie. The wisecracks will never end. You&#x27;ll be amazed how many useless characters just pop up out of nowhere for the sole purpose of explaining the plot. You won&#x27;t believe how much gun ammunition the main characters have to shoot at birds but no food. This movie is ridiculous, but if you have a sense of humor or are a filmmaker and want a guide on what NOT to do...SEE THIS MOVIE!!	1
10 out of 10 best movie ever	Remote island, Pluto	I just want to say that this is the best movie ev- hahahaha - I can&#x27;t keep this up... to tell the truth, this is not a well made movie but watching it was one of the best times I ever had with my friends. It was so bad that it was funny, you really should watch it with your friends so you can laugh at it together. Because of this movie, my friends and I even started a small group to watch bad movies and laugh. This is definitely the best worst movie I have ever seen. But it was very fun to watch and never got boring because of all the mistakes and the bad screenplay. Not to mention the actors... So thank you Nguyen for your horrible sound editing, absolutely emotionless main character (Bagh) and ABSOLUTELY horrible birds. You really did a (horribly) great job. THANK YOU!	10
Was this thing made by retarded school children?	United States	The audio sucks, camera work is erratic, dialog is painfully delivered. Script must have been written in crayon. Establishing shots held way way way too long. Action starts way way too late. Foley is sad, CGI is hilarious.....Were they trying to kill the art of film? The lack of acting skill reminds me of a 3rd grade Christmas play.By FAR the worst movie EVER.Even the Rifftrax version was hard to watch....The only believable actor was the little girl. What is with the fully auto M-16? None of the people in the other cars seem to notice the attacking birds.THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!	1
Bad ripoff of Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds	United States	SPOILER ALERT. Possibly. I don&#x27;t want to be on the blacklistJames Nguyen&#x27;s fantastically bad remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1963 masterpiece is truly one of the great cinematic tragedies of the 21st Century. From awful camera-work to stony acting to crappy dialogue to the incoherent and ridiculous plot, from the craptastic .gif birds that don&#x27;t do anything to the repetitive loop of the squawking, everything about this movie screams &#x22;just kill me&#x22;. This movie takes the shitty film quality in found footage and makes it shittier. On top of all of this, there is a weak and bizarre forced environmentalist message that claims the birds are sentient and punish humans because of global warming or some bullshit like this. Save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t watch this worthless piece of crap.	1
Shock and Terror is completely right.	United States	Last night, I went to a local movie rental store with my grandparents to rent some movies to watch. We rented two movies. First, we rented Saving Mr. Banks. It&#x27;s a fantastic movie, I suggest you watch it. Second, we rented this. This was more for my pleasure because I knew neither of them would like it. So, this morning, I sat down and saw it. Oh boy&#x85; This movie stars a guy named Rod. He&#x27;s your average marketer until he meets the girl of his dreams. They go out for a little bit, and then all of a sudden, a huge swarm of birds attacks the city! And that is literally the entire plot. The story is just so random. It&#x27;s almost like a really crappy sitcom for a while then BIRDS! HOLY CRAP BIRDS! What I love most about the &#x22;plot&#x22; of this movie is that the first forty minutes or so is completely worthless. This movie is about birds attacking the series, so why is there so much relationship and work drama? Plus, there are scenes that don&#x27;t make sense. For example, at one point in the movie, a guy goes to the main character&#x27;s house about making a deal to install a solar panel to the house. What does that have to do with the plot? Absolutely nothing. Nothing new was added to the plot, none of this is ever mentioned again, so&#x85; why? What&#x27;s the point? The cinematography is absolute crap. The camera never steadies and focuses on the right thing. Every shot looks like it belongs in a home movie. There are some shots that feel completely random and just out of place. It just looks awful. The editing is even worse. The scene transitions are beyond choppy with so many, many jump cuts. There are literally four jump cuts in the same exact scene at one point. Plus, this movie has that audio static you get when recording with a low budget camera, only in this movie between every scene the level of static changes. And sometimes it goes away altogether. Hey Nguyen- I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever heard of this before. It&#x27;s called a boom-mike? It&#x27;s really neat! It makes all the sound sound much crisper without all that audio static. But I see you wasted your entire 10 dollar budget on CGI, so what&#x27;s the point of telling you this? Speaking of CGI&#x85; ugh&#x85; the CGI is poop! It&#x27;s the kind of bad that you can&#x27;t describe just because of the sheer amount of awful it withholds. It&#x27;s just&#x85; bad. All the CGI is put into birds, explosions, and blood effects. Do you think you could&#x27;ve tried a little harder? The birds are absolutely ridiculous. Not only are they animated like crap, but they just make no sense. These birds literally dive-bomb towards the city, kamikaze style, and explode on impact. Also, they have no actual entrance or exit in the movie. After forty minutes of the bullcrap that is the story, the birds just appear and start attacking everybody. No explanation why, they just do. And at the end, they just fly away like it&#x27;s nothing. There&#x27;s no reason why they should. There&#x27;s no indication of anything that happens that would drive the birds away. This plot hole makes the movie all the more pointless. Now I have to touch on the acting. The acting rendered me speechless. Wooden does not begin to describe the acting. Everyone seems like they&#x27;re phoning it in, and even that is being too generous. Everyone does an absolutely awful job. Especially the main character. He brings a whole new level of awful to the table. I&#x27;ve seen better acting from the people that are in the home videos on AFV. And they aren&#x27;t even acting! I just&#x85; I&#x85; I can&#x27;t! I can&#x27;t do this! Overall, Birdemic Shock and Terror is horrendous. The acting sucks, the CGI sucks, the story (or what little there is, anyway) sucks, there are scenes that make no sense, the cinematography looks like it was done by a toddler, the audio is grating, the characters are annoying, everything just sucks! And do you know what the cherry on top is? THIS MOVIE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE. I&#x27;m serious. The characters in the movie say that &#x22;global warming&#x22; is the cause of all this. Bullcrap! What a cop-out! In terms of quality, this movie is definitely the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. I still like it better than Battlefield Earth, though. Score: 1.0/10	1
The best worst movie ever.	United Kingdom	Birdemic is undoubtedly the worst piece of film-making I have had the pleasure of viewing. Everything about it is badly done: from the sound that clips in and out; the spotty lighting; the weird camera work, the stunted, jarring, awkward dialogue; the &#x22;CGI&#x22; and the total complete utter lack of anything somewhat resembling a plot. However, all of this comes together to create a really entertaining watch. Provided you have a few friends and don&#x27;t attempt to take it seriously, this movie will make you cry with laughter. Its truly an achievement that the movie is so consistently bad, in such a consistently hilarious way.Everyone should watch this masterpiece. Not only will you have a great time, and learn lots about how global warming really works, but you will then appreciate how good other movies really are.	10
I felt my brain melting and eyes aching	Norway	When a movie starts with music that grinds your ears, standard movie- maker font, 10 minutes of random shots from the valleys of Hollywood and an unknown B-movie director that claims he&#x27;s the &#x22;master of romantic thrillers&#x22;, you know you&#x27;re in for one hell of a ride. I don&#x27;t really know if this movie is a joke or not, if they actually went in full force with the intention of actually making a great film with their 10.000 dollar budget, clearly they did not. When the actual film starts, the camera is so horrid I thought the cameraman was drunk, or if I was unwillingly intoxicated. Anyways, I had to check my earphones after a couple of minutes, because the sound suddenly stopped and popped up at random, looks like the sound-mixer of this movie probably is deaf or some sort of modern day Hellen Keller. Let&#x27;s say something about the acting.. if there is any. I felt my heart wrenching when the protagonist started reading his lines, his act is already so wooden after two minutes of screen-time he&#x27;d fit right in the Ents from the &#x22;Lord of the Rings&#x22;-trilogy. When an actor can&#x27;t even walk straight without showing signs of having something rectangular shoved up his rectum, there&#x27;s something wrong.After about 45 minutes of clapping (yes, see it for yourself), a love story that makes the Twilight-saga seem like &#x22;The Notebook&#x22; and &#x22;Titanic&#x22; combined, dialouges that are from another planet and all-in- all all I&#x27;m thinking: Is this movie the &#x22;Shock and Terror&#x22; the sub-title proclamates? &#x27;Cause I haven&#x27;t seen a f*cking bird yet!!When the birds arrive.. No, I don&#x27;t even care to write about it.. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel like laying down in the shower with my clothes on and cry while the cold water is running on full.This movie basically makes Tommy Wiseau&#x27;s &#x22;The Room&#x22; seem like the new &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;. Enough said.	1
Among the best of the worst	None	Oh boy.When I first saw this movie, I couldn&#x27;t contain my laughter. You&#x27;re greeted with 40 minutes of absolutely nothing important AT ALL, and suddenly, birds.That are fixed to the camera.Through all the horrible editing, crappy sound quality, wooden acting, terrible effects, pointless scenes and ear-bleeding sound effects, this is way up there among the best of the worst, along with The Room, Troll 2 and Plan 9 From Outer Space.I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good laugh.	8
Most amazing piece of garbage Ive ever had the pleasure of seeing	United States	Shocking and terrorizing is right. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. All I can say is it has the worst editing, worst sound, worst acting, worst directing, worst special effects, worst story, and worst ending ever told. However it is by far the most breathtaking failure I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s like watching a work of art by Picasso created with dog poop and vomit under sewage water. Maybe that&#x27;s what makes it fun to watch because of its honesty in trying to make a horror film with very limited resources. The pacing is atrocious though in that you will finally see the birds attack about 45 minutes through the movie and the birds look like Windows 95 screen savers. The sound editing...it&#x27;s like every shot you will hear the difference in the background noise and by the time you see them &#x22;firing&#x22; guns your ears will explode due to the intensity of the sound. Forget about the plot because it doesn&#x27;t even need one. All in all I can say it&#x27;s a great movie to laugh at even when you are not drunk.	4
This is what happen if The Birds wasnt directed by Alfred Hitchcock, but a crazy fan of his	United States	Failure &#x96;noun 1. an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success: 2. nonperformance of something due, required, or expected: 3. James Nguyen&#x27;s &#x22;Birdemic&#x22;. Birdemic is just plan awful. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t even belong in the &#x27;it&#x27;s so bad, it&#x27;s good&#x27; group of bad movies. It&#x27;s lacks any sense of entertainment. At first, I thought this was a student film, due to it&#x27;s windows movie maker CGI effects, wooden acting, audio conflict and bad editing shots, but no, this movie was just produce by James Nguyen, the modern day Ed Wood with Tippi Hedren serving as his Bela Lugusi. He never received any formal training in movie-making, but instead grew up watching the movies of Alred Hitchcock, including his 1963 picture &#x27;The birds&#x27;. It took the director four years to make this movie, and it&#x27;s still awful. Please James Nguyen, learn how to make a movie, please. Birdemic: Shock and Terror starts with the shocking and terrifying Rod (Alan Bagh) who the camera loves to show driving and walking over loop music, badly made sound effects, or blank silence. Rod meets up with aspiring fashion model Nathalie (Whitney Moore) and begins dating her. The dialogue between the two wooden actors are just bad. It&#x27;s like a hurricane blew through the script and devastated every line in it&#x27;s path. The whole idea of the two main characters being a couple is just awkward as both have no connection with each other, it felt like the actress didn&#x27;t really wanted to be there. The whole love story is just painfully to watch due to it&#x27;s dullish. The first part of the movie is so boring with non needed scenes, bad fade in and fade outs, and long pauses when cuts are needed. Most of the audience is just waiting for the birds to attack and kill these folks just because the movie need some type of entertaining value. Rod and Nathalie woke up to find that their town Half Moon Bay is under attack from CGI photoshop eagles and vultures that spit acid, disappear in end of shots and explode into flames upon striking the ground. I&#x27;m not a naturalist like Charles Darwin, but I don&#x27;t think birds explode or spit acid due to Global Warning effects. The movie love to mention Global Warning, but doesn&#x27;t really do a good job on explaining it. They even had a badly written doctor on a bridge to try to explain it, and he wouldn&#x27;t do the job. Even Al Gore would hate this movie. The whole plot is directless, and the movie tries to pay tribute to &#x27;The Birds&#x27;, but felt like a cheap knock off of that. The sound is horrible, there are scenes where the movie go silence, yet in others, such as the one at the beaches. The sound of the waves crashing, makes the movie hard to hear. Don&#x27;t get me started on the annoying sound during the attack, and things rubbing against the microphone. Oh god the bird screams, my ears are bleeding. I wasn&#x27;t even aware it was possible to fail this badly. It fails as a romance and it really fails as a horror flick. I try to look for any good notes for the film, and I can&#x27;t find anything worth noting. That&#x27;s how bad, I dislike this film. I can&#x27;t believe that they are even thinking of making a 2nd movie: Birdemic 2: The Resurrection. Birdemic is just pure cinematic failure on absolutely every conceivable level. I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t written, produced, directed and starred in by Alan Smithee. This movie makes Troll 2 look like Orson Welles &#x27;Citizen Kane&#x27; or Tommy Wiseau &#x27;The Room&#x27; look like Godfather. Check it out at your own cost. It&#x27;s worth watching if you like your eyes prick by GIF clip-art birds.	1
Wretched	Earth (Middle)	Easily in the class of worst movies ever made, Birdemic has obsoletely nothing to recommend it other than a hilarious send-up of it by the folks at Rifftrax. The acting is horrible, the script is a mess of confusion, the directing is worse, and the special effects look like they were done by an 8yo on an old Quadra 660av. The movie lacks all the charm of something like Plan 9 From Outer Space and fits in well with dreck like Manos The Hand of Fate.If at all possible, avoid seeing this film. Drive many miles out of your way if need be.Even if you like bad movies in general, this movie will test your limits.	1
How did no one prevent this abomination from coming into being?	None	A lot of things have been said about this movie, I read most of the reviews, but nothing could prepare me for the clogged toilet full of sh*t that is birdemic. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I think you should see it, but it is truly the worst movie EVER.Okay the CGI is HORRIBLE, the sound transitions between scenes are so bad you will think somebody switched the channel and none of the actors have any real talent. The plot is more made up of mistakes than an actual story, all characters are one dimensional and boring at best. The best part of the movie is the worst part of a porn movie, seeing the chick in her underwear.Why I still think you should watch this is because of the leading role, Rod (or whatever), played by Alan Bagh. I think a cardboard cutout of the &#x22;They&#x27;re eating her! And then they&#x27;re going to eat me! Oh my GOOOOOOOOD!&#x22;-guy from troll 2 (search it on youtube if you haven&#x27;t seen it) would do a better job than this guy. He can not do a single movement naturally, seriously everything he does looks ridiculous. EVERYTHING. He can&#x27;t walk, talk, get into a car or even stand still like a normal person.The first half hour of the movie (no birds yet) is hilarious because of him stumbling around like someone who is recovering from a severe stroke and had most of his brain removed. Moore tries to save it and she&#x27;s actually not half bad (okay she&#x27;s pretty bad but so much better than Bagh) but it just doesn&#x27;t work because she has to act like she likes him. HE IS THE MOST BORING ZERO-DIMENSIONAL C*CKSUCKER EVER WHY WOULD ANYONE GIVE A SH*T ABOUT HIS HOBBIES OR HIS STUPID JOB.The plot is total garbage of course, but what bothers me most is the TOTAL LACK OF SENSE on Nguyens part. At one point they find a dead bird on the beach, but instead of getting a dead chicken somewhere they use a CGI bird. IT LOOKS TERRIBLE. WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING.This movie makes 2012: Ice Age look like Avatar. In comparison to this, Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus is worthy of 10 Oscars. It is unbelievable that anyone would produce this, did no one with a milligram of sense and taste watch this before it was brought out? Nguyen and everyone he knows should be whipped severely for making this hell spawn of a movie.Bottom line: Go watch it and be amazed at the unbelievable amounts of incompetence one can show in just 90 minutes. Don&#x27;t forget your eye bleach!	1
I dont know what to say	United States	Really, I&#x27;m at a loss. What can be said about a movie like Birdemic? All the reviews you can find detail the innumerable problems: the poor directing, the lack of consistent sound quality (including the famous &#x22;HI&#x22; from the waitress at the beginning), the crappy GIFs of birds sloppily pasted over the screen, which spit acidic orange juice and explode and make airplane noises, acting worse than the average porno, etc.But does this movie really deserve review? A review of a movie implies that it is.....well, a professional film. Birdemic is listed on a site alongside The Godfather and Avatar, and it received a theatrical release. But it doesn&#x27;t seem right. This movie simply does not exist in the same realm as what anyone would call a &#x22;movie.&#x22; It dips down into the 90s era of home movies, manufactured by a few high schoolers in the summer with a pirated copy of Adobe Aftereffects.What I&#x27;m saying is that to review this film on IMDb almost implies that it deserves being on the same 1 to 10 rating scale used for the rest of the films on this site. The rating scale doesn&#x27;t apply because it&#x27;s just not made like a movie.	1
Does anyone know how to erase memories?	United Kingdom	I cant quite begin to explain the magnitude of why this film is most definitely the most diabolical example of cinematography I have ever seen in my life....It started when a group of my friends stumbled across the trailer. After watching we thought &#x22;man this film looks so bad it must be worth a watch even if its to laugh at!&#x22; But oh no people this is not a film so bad its good... its just plain dreadful, and if any of you have seen the trailer then I say to you that its even worse than it looks(somehow, which I could never have dreamed was possible).Lets state the obvious: The acting was disastrous. I really hope these actors got paid in barley water or some other worthless item. I have seen primary school plays with more conviction. Any emotion that could have been displayed in the romantic scenes was so clearly fake its unreal. I mean the actors couldn&#x27;t even pretend to shoot properly, they just vaguely lifted up their guns and threw them about. Now this is probably something to do with the fact that this is without a doubt the worse example of the use of CGI in the history of man. I think men in bird suits would have done a better job. The birds were so fake they quite literally moved exactly with the camera as if stuck on even though they were done by computer!As for the story line I&#x27;m not sure how or why James Nguyen thought of the reasons given in the film but they are barely worth mentioning. And why there was a seemingly random crusade about global warming is beyond me as it made no sense as to why it was causing the birds to attack. Even worse than this was the little details. For example multiple times in the film the main cast decided to get out of their car and begin strolling around having picnics, without a care in the world. Then surprise surprise birds attacked. If the writer cannot think of legitimate reasons for the characters action he should perhaps go back to the drawing board (all though I&#x27;m pretty sure he spent about 5 seconds pondering if he could get away with this excuse for a screenplay). Now the not so obvious stuff: In the trailer you don&#x27;t even get a sense for how terrible the editing is. Events seem to occur at random times and in some scenes you can see the actors waiting for the director to shout &#x22;action!&#x22; (no joke you really can its like their all zombified for a few seconds, and this doesn&#x27;t happen just once!). When it comes to the lyrical component of the film you might as well give up now. Every few seconds back ground noise would change from complete silence to over powering fuzz where some shots were so obviously done at different times. It was like the actors were in different rooms, it was mad!Now the ending is possibly the worse bit. I wont completely ruin it but all in all the birds go away. That&#x27;s it! Why, we will never know.So unless you are on crack cocaine, are thinking of doing something slightly more fun than suicide or just plain out of your mind, please, I beg of you, don&#x27;t watch this film. No seriously don&#x27;t! You will wind up like me wishing that you had kicked your own mother&#x27;s head in or done some other task that was of more value than watching Birdemic.One last thought: How does flu make birds explode?	1
You have to see it to believe it!	United States	I love bad movies and watching bad movies. I was really excited to see birdemic because all the bad reviews I have heard. The first word that was said in this movie pretty much told me what i was in for. At the beginning of this movie I was excited to see a really crappy movie and make me laugh hard. I was terribly wrong. By the first hour I just wanted the movie to end. Not only the audio was the worst I have ever heard, the editing was a joke, the lighting was awful but besides all that it was terribly boring the first about 30-40 minutes. What i was hoping to see was birds attacking people for the whole movie in really ridiculous ways but in the first 30-40 minutes the movie was just a day and the life of a really average and boring guy. The character&#x27;s acting didn&#x27;t help at all either. Not only was the character boring but I feel like the film could have been only 30 minutes long if there weren&#x27;t so many shots of useless and pointless shots, mainly of them main character driving! It was just shot after shot of a car entering and leaving a shot. The worst part of this movie is the audio. The audio was is the most noticeable part of the movie. There are times when the person isn&#x27;t talking but they are still talking, ambient sound volume was being changed every other second. It was as if sound mixer brought up audio only when a character was talking then brought the sound back down when they finished. The final verdict is that if you are someone that love to laugh at bad movies this might not be for you because its just way to bad, but if you have to watch it then watch it with a ton of people and make jokes during the movie. You will not believe how bad this movie is. Oh and one more thing, prepare for some really lame social commentary over global warming.	2
I am insulted that IMDb only gave this a 2 out of 10	Wisconsin	--- A 2 out of 10? I am INSULTED! Clearly this is the absolute worst movie I had to endure in over 20 years and I am positive the makers were trying very hard for a ZERO! And in MY book that is exactly what it got, a BIG F A T zero out of ten. --- I have no idea where to start with this example of a junior high school project that some how got picked up for rental production. The &#x22;eagles&#x22; and &#x22;hawks&#x22;, and I use those terms loosely, look like they were stolen out of some 80&#x27;s arcade video game. Their movement is one dimensional and have no other motion than to exist in the air with wings moving up and down. I have never known the eagles where I live to be able to hover in mid-air facing upward as if on a flag...very curious. --- Maybe I missed the part where someone was identified as an arms dealer, but suddenly the freaky eagles appear around the people and there are screams, &#x22;ooooh,&#x22; &#x22;eeeewwww,&#x22; &#x22;ahhhh...,&#x22; then someone has an idea. I swear I expected a light bulb to appear. The idea goes from thought to action...&#x22;hey, we are under attack by killer one dimensional birds. Here, take this automatic weapon I just happen to have in the back seat and open fire.&#x22; &#x22;Oh yeah and use the thousand round magazine I have in the gun too!&#x22; That is all I can stand to say about it. Oh wait, I just have to tell you to keep your eye out for those attack clothes hangers too. --- This is the first movie that I actually demanded a refund from Family Video over. I thought Alien vs Ninja was getting my waste of space award for the month but then this movie came along and blew Alien vs Ninja right out of the water. ---Alien vs Ninja = 02 , Birdemic = 00. When watched together they earn a solid -01 . Mathematical explanation (+02x00=-01)	1
My God,where do I begin?	United States	Well,well,I wish I knew where to start,but here goes: Young man works at some software company and strikes a million dollar deal.He runs into some blonde girl who he went to school with years ago and they hook up and begin a relationship.He meets her mom.Her mom thinks she should get a real estate job instead of being a lingerie model,but is happy for her when she gets to work for Victoria&#x27;s Secret.All of that happens in the first 45 minutes.They go out of town and get a room and then there are eagles hoovering outside their window and they make their escape.They meet another couple who happen to have machine guns or Uzis,which they never seem to run out of ammo and begin killing the birds.These birds fly around,attacking people and running into cars and exploding,but these birds look more like something you&#x27;d see on a video game than something truly horrifying..OK,I&#x27;ll stop there,but I have a few questions: When the couple stop on the side of the road when they see a guy with a cowboy hat,the guy wants their gas,but Rod(the &#x22;lead&#x22; actor)tells the man they need it.The guy has a gun and points it at Rod,so Rod goes to the back to get the gas and when the guy is ready to leave with the gas,a bird swoops by and kills him.Now,the gas canister is left behind.How come Rod didn&#x27;t get it,if he told the guy they needed the gas??..I noticed they seems pretty relaxed when they&#x27;re having a picnic out in the open.You have birds trying to kill you and you&#x27;re going to have a picnic OUT IN THE OPEN?? They couldn&#x27;t eat in the van instead? Much safer,especially if you have 2 kids with you,right? By the way,they got the kids from a vehicle whose family were killed by the birds before the man in the cowboy hat took their gas..I guess I could go on about the editing and the sound,but you have to see it for yourself..It is have been said that this is worse than Troll 2 and you know something? I believe them.You might agree as well..Enjoy!!	2
Worst film ever.	Chicago	It&#x27;s bad. Like really really bad. The only reason it got a sequel is (at least i think so) is because people had such a morbid fascination with the movie and found some sort of charm in its mixture of bad special effects, terrible acting and everything not nice that they had to make a second film to cash in on the fascination, but there is nothing in this film that actually warrants that at all, because it just doesn&#x27;t work as a solo watch and only as a drinking game movie that you and your friends can laugh at as a sad attempt to mask the suffering that you are actually having watching it. But for some reason it continues to be ranked as a movie that is so bad it&#x27;s good alongside such films as The Room and Plan 9 from Outer Space, but at least in those movies you could see the enjoyability in them and like them. But in this one, there is no enjoyability. P.S. Why is Gunday number 1 on the bottom 100?	1
Lung exploding comedy! no joke, watch this movie.	Rehovot, Israel	Ill start by stating that if that movie claimed it was a comedy, i would have rated it a solid 6.This movie caught us by complete surprise. A bunch of friends came by my place to hang out, we got high and and a genius idea popped into my head. &#x22;Let&#x27;s watch a god awful movie&#x22; i said. I goggled &#x22;imdb bottom rated movies&#x22; and rest will be forever remembered as the day that a 1.8/10 IMDb movie made us soil our pants laughing.We literally laughed the entire movie. Every thing in this movie is of kindergarten quality, CGI reminds me of Microsoft Powerpoint presentations i use to make in my grade school days. The audio is sickening and half of the movie you cant hear jack squat because a boom Mic was out of the budget apparently. Everything was just eye-gouging, suicide inducing awful.WE LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT, in fact we watched the second movie immediately after the first one, and it was just as hilarious.Please watch this movie. get as high as possible if you can...thank me later.	1
The reason IMDb needs a 0/10 score	None	I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of &#x22;worst of all time&#x22; movies lately, and most have been so bad that they&#x27;re good. This movie is so bad that it&#x27;s insulting to all the other terrible movies. There is no accurate way to quantify the awfulness of this movie. I&#x27;m certain the director has never seen another movie, I&#x27;ve seen amateur highschool movies that put this to absolute SHAME. To begin, the first half of the movie is the most awkward, poorly written, terribly acted romance of all time. Half the scenes include characters driving, parking, getting in and out of the car. The audio is so bad that the quality changes in the middle of scenes; outdoor scenes at the beach are inaudible because there is absolutely no editing of the audio. The entire plot is pointless, with the first bird attack happening halfway through the movie. The effects....wow. There is one terrible scene with birds attacking in the absolute worst imaginable animation of all time, clip art from Microsoft Office essentially. They couldn&#x27;t even get a stuffed bird to serve as a dead bird, they use clipart instead. There are 3 animations for the birds throughout the entire film, the first 2 which are reused over 10 times. I can&#x27;t actually....I can&#x27;t finish the review. This movie is an abomination...it&#x27;s an insult to everyone that watches it, it&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s not even worth watching for the laughs. James Nyugen is a terrible person for making this, and if there is a hell, he&#x27;ll be walking into the fire before Hitler or Stalin.	1
A movie so terrible is fascinating	United Kingdom	I don&#x27;t know where to begin this review. It is a film that completely fails at every step of the movie making process. From directing, to acting, to writing, to camera operation, to scene structure, to pacing, to visual effects, to sound editing... The list goes on. I watched birdemic thinking it was a &#x27;deliberately bad so it&#x27;s funny&#x27; kinda movie. It&#x27;s not. You can see the films director James Nguyan takes himself completely seriously with the global warming message jammed down our throats. I spent the majority of the hour and thirty minute run time laughing in disbelief that this movie exists. It is a film you have to watch, if only to know how to gauge a bad movie in the future. I was just wondering what fundamental error they were going to make next. Overall birdemic is a fascinating piece of work simply because it is truly awful cinema. So terrible that it&#x27;s unintentionally hilarious. I would absolutely classify it as a must watch.	1
Very poorly made movie, yet at times humorous.	United States	Make no mistake, this movie is painfully bad. It has a horrible camera, very bad acting, not so special effects, abysmal sound, etc. But if you&#x27;re able to endure the movie, I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ll have a few laughs at the movie&#x27;s expense (like the clapping scene). I did, which is why I&#x27;m giving it three stars instead of one. I don&#x27;t regret watching the movie, but I don&#x27;t see myself wanting to watch it again.The birds are the same two poorly animated models (an eagle and a sea gull), they flap around making the same annoying sound, the guns are obviously air soft guns, the birds only have about 2-3 dying animations. The dialogue is painfully bad. I question whether it was done and shot purposely like that in an attempt to be humorous.There also may be an underlining message that global warming may be a serious concern to our planet, but the movie was too stupid for me to actually care.	3
Birdemic is a gem in so bad its good cinema	San Antonio	Birdemic: Shock and Terror is a horrible movie. Everything that can be construed as competent filmmaking can&#x27;t be found here. Horrible acting, horrible dialog, horrible plot, horrible effects, and horrible everything else. However, if you love bad movies that bring the laughs, then this is a treat.Good: There&#x27;s nothing good here. Everything is done so badly. However, if you love bad movies, then it&#x27;s a masterpiece. Beyond wooden acting and dialog along with a dumb preachy plot and just stupidity from all fronts make this the perfect movie to make jokes with your friends and some beers.Bad: Going by movie standards, it fails. The actors here are all beyond bad, their delivery is so painful, the effects are horrible, the plot is both preachy and idiotic, there&#x27;s no smooth transitions with some of the worst editing I&#x27;ve ever seen, logic is thrown out the window in every scene, and it makes you wonder how anyone involved would look at this as even OK.Overall, it&#x27;s a terrible movie. It is still one of the funniest train wrecks that Ed Wood would be proud of. If you love bad cinema, watch this now. Everyone else, just leave.	1
I am disturbed that this could even be considered a movie!	United States	Let&#x27;s kick off the review by getting one thing clear...This is one of the most absolute and downright awful films I have ever seen in my entire life. There was nothing good about this film except the sigh of relief when the credits roll in the end. Honestly please do not watch this film expecting anything, or you know better yet do not see this film at all. Now if you do decide to see this movie make sure you have something such as alcohol and friends because let me assure you of something..You are going to need it!Now to talk about the film you need to know that the actors are unbearably bad as well as the so-called script they&#x27;re reading. The editing/special effect were done in such a way that it made the movie feel even worse due to it&#x27;s lack of artistic direction or for better words any direction at all. The clarity of both the audio and video were absolutely awful because 1: It sounds as it&#x27;s done with no microphones of any kind throughout. 2: The Video clarity is so bad you have to wash your own glasses to make sure that isn&#x27;t the issue. Another issue is the extremely clich&#xE9; so-called scenes of Fights, Love, and Drama made this movie even more of a laugh for me.This movie was so poorly done that I will never watch it again even if it&#x27;s with some friends for comedic purposes. I was surprised that I was even able to finish this movie. If you decide to watch this be prepared for itFinal Rating 0.5/10	1
Not so bad its good... Just so bad its funny.	Newcastle, Australia	Where to start... Birdemic. There. A start. People can describe many movies with a sentence. Unless you come to describe Birdemic. Sure, you may say &#x22;It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s funny&#x22;, but to describe the content in one sentence leaves you with &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22;. The shock is there (the birds... which are GIF&#x27;s stuck in a place on the screen, moving with the camera), but the only terror is... uh...Aprroximatley 90 minutes, the first 45 involve nothing. Unless you call a creepy salesman getting a girls&#x27; phone number, same salesman making a sale, announcing it to his job, having other employees applaud him for 95 seconds (even thought he made them lose a couple of a million dollars, but who cares when you sell something) and bad sound quality something. If you are more like me, however, you should watch this part anyways.And then the badly animated birds appear and attack, because of global warming or something like that. They kill people, you know, nothing exiting, really. And wow, those kids must hate their mother.And the ending. I thought when reading reviews, &#x22;I can&#x27;t be THAT bad.&#x22; Then I accepted the truth. The ending was terrible.But, ending on a positive note, this movie is unintentionally funny. Hilarious. The lines of poorly written dialog make the movie bearable. I would give this 8 out of 10 if it was intentionally bad and funny, but since, it is not, I give a two. It doesn&#x27;t deserve a good rating, but the outcome makes it more than a one.	2
Vietnamese Uwe Boll, lower on cash but higher on stupid/insane	Zagreb, Croatia	This is one of the rare &#x22;Hey, I just got a camera, let&#x27;s film something&#x22; abominations that I enjoyed..but I use term enjoyment loosely as this thing is, what I call, an endurance testing vehicle.It doesn&#x27;t quite have the charm of The Room (another home made keeper), but it excels in all of the other trashy movie checklist dogma(s)..absolutely no plot, absolutely no acting, absolutely no special effects, absolutely no directing/editing/sound, absolutely NOTHING. And that is what keeps this boat from sinking brutally as I have yet to find such an inept attempt at recording something. Anything.It was interspersed with boring bits and some headache inducing moments. They were worthy adversary but if you can manage to go through them you will be rewarded as I was.As a lot of reviewers mentioned, lead character is the funniest. Even the most mundane actions such as walking and talking seem strange to him as he tries to mimic these actions.All in all, a must see film, either for laughing at it or watching it in disbelief.Belongs in Top 5 Bottom barrel (for now).	10
One of the Worst Movies Ever Created	United States	Rated: 1/10 Rounded to 1I can&#x27;t even express how bad this film is. The only reason one would watch this is to make fun of pretty much every aspect of the film. It is so terrible it&#x27;s almost funny. The animation is terrible, the birds literally float in mid air while barely flapping their wings. The acting is almost as bad as the animation, we won&#x27;t even talk about it. And the first 50 min. of the film has absolutely no point and doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the rest of the film. I&#x27;ve made better films with 3 kid actors, Nerf guns, and a $30 video camera in my back yard... and I have proof. To sum it up, do not watch this movie... it&#x27;s the kind of movie someone would use to torture a prisoner.Was this review helpful? If so, check out my other reviews.

Drunky Dwarf reviews : Birdemic: Shock and Terror ( 2010).	Belgium	Waw, just wow. U know that feeling when you&#x27;re having a conversation and then the conversation stops because you don&#x27;t know anything more to talk about? That is pretty much the dialog for this movie. U can&#x27;t call it dialog either, it&#x27;s like 45 minutes of dead silence. This movie is so uncomfortable, it&#x27;s more comfortable to watch your grandmother making out with a giant pink furry unicorn with a Justin Bieber face then watching this movie.The problem with the acting is that it feels so unnatural. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re watching a bunch of robots who are programmed to walk to this place, then do that. They don&#x27;t give any motivations for their actions. If u would replace the main actor with a tree, i wouldn&#x27;t notice it. My guess that they are taken from the p-business ( IMDb is forcing me to censor this word) .That would explain why the bed scene is the best scene in the entire movie.Let&#x27;s talk about the plot: there is a guy and he earns a million dollars or something. He meets a random blond girl in a caf&#xE9; and he seduces-es her with a creepy smile. So they drive around and they visit her mother, they go to work and visit an Irish pub! Then suddenly........ a random singer sings for them. The bland guy dances the same for 5 minutes. Oh yeah there is something with birds too in the last part. And speeches about global warming , long LONG speeches from the most random people ( a tree-hugger?) The plot and the characters are so stupid. Everybody who worked at this movie should be ashamed. The plot makes no sense and the writers , sorry the writer, who is also the director, probably also the editor, producer, sound editor and donut boy, was permanently high. The most random thing about the movie is that when the birds start attacking the main characters, they just go in a random house to see other random people. Then they start riding with their magic car. A car that randomly spawns stuff that they need. &#x22;Oh look, it&#x27;s a machine gun!&#x22; &#x22; It&#x27;s a fishing rod!&#x22; &#x22; And there, a AK47&#x22; &#x22; Oh hey, Godzilla eggs here!&#x22; &#x22; OMG , a nuke&#x22; OK maybe those last ones weren&#x27;t true but if they indeed would happen i wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.Let&#x27;s talk about the biggest problem of the movie. U don&#x27;t care about the story and neither do the characters and the writer. For example: children just had their parents killed, they don&#x27;t care, they just want a happy meal? Somebody just died, OK they are sad for like three seconds and then it&#x27;s OK again. They don&#x27;t even censor the other cars. It&#x27;s not an apocalypse when you see everybody driving around. ( maybe the birds learned to drive?) The filmmaker obviously didn&#x27;t care to make a good movie so why should we care ?This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Everything about it is bad. The ending is terrible; it is all so bad. If i ever watch this movie again i will puke out birds everywhere. The movie&#x27;s biggest enemy is not the birds but the director itself ( and the hungry kids).( Btw : in case u don&#x27;t know, the special effects are really bad).	1
The Must See Worst Film!!!	United States	I have seen The Room. Birdemic makes The Room seem like a much better movie. A lot of things don&#x27;t make sense.The movie starts out with the main character driving along which looks like Malibu Canyon Rd near Los Angeles. Then all of sudden he is suppose to be in Northern California. I guess we are not suppose to notice this movie doesn&#x27;t make sense. Why did they choose Eagles and Vultures as the birds that would attack people? I guess they are the biggest and most scariest birds they could find.I think Tommy Wiseau was at least attempting to make at least a decent movie with The Room. I gave this movie 5 out 10 of just because of how crazy this movie is. I really liked the bad CGI in this movie. It&#x27;s funny seeing those birds just Floating in Air. It&#x27;s like they levitating or something.	5
Oh my	United Kingdom	Almost impossible review as a commercial movies, &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; looks like a home-made project that somehow got a release. Everything about it screams UNPROFESSIONAL!!! From the very basic opening credits, which are in a hideous PC-average font, to the very long and static shots that start too early (before the actors are ready) and go on too long (after the action or conversations have ended), which show no understanding of cutting or editing. From the terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle, revealing that there microphone was on the camera and sometimes the background noise drowns out the dialogue, to the script and acting which makes you want to throw things (the lead guy walks like a drugged 5 year old, which is a shame as there are many long minutes of footage devoted to showing him just walking).And then we have to bird effects which look like a screen saver or a phone app. Stuck just on top of the filmed action we see looped animations of birds which can seemingly hover in one place flapping in slow motion.The appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating, meeting the parents, visiting restaurants and driving cars before anything happens. Once the bird attacks start, our gang of 4-6 &#x22;survivors&#x22; (apart from all the people strolling about that are not part of the film, and the endless traffic of other cars and trucks that are also not part of the film) seem to make a mad dash from the city (why is not explained) into the countryside (why that&#x27;s safer is not explained), stopping regularly to buy gigantic bottles of water, armfuls of food and tanks full of petrol, only to somehow have to drink from streams and eat seaweed and a fish caught from the ocean only minutes later, when they can&#x27;t be more than a few minutes stroll from another convenience store.You need nerves of steel to be able to sit through this and call it entertainment. I can only assume this is a home movie. If it is, it must have been fun for the actors and their friends to watch once it was finished, but how actually got to be distributed and sold commercially is a total mystery.	2
Pass the Popcorn review	Osijek, Croatia	In 1963 Alfred Hitchcock made his cult movie &#x27;The Birds in 2010 James Nguyen took the concept to a whole new level. Birdemic is currently the sixth worst movie on the IMDb &#x22;Bottom 100 movies&#x22; list, which is still pretty low. It might just be the worst, most boring movie about killer birds and ecology ever made.Rod (Alan Bagh) is a successful software salesman who has just started dating Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model. As it usually happens in movies, their perfect lives are suddenly threatened by, in this case, killer birds that, interestingly, start attacking them after they&#x27;ve spent their first night together.This movie is so bad it isn&#x27;t even funny. It begins with endless scenes of Rod driving around town and moves onto horribly edited phone call scenes. If you skip the first hour, you&#x27;re guaranteed not to miss anything except a really bad and boring introduction to the story. I can&#x27;t understand why was Alan Bagh chosen to play the lead since he is clearly the worst actor of all and even a tree could have done a better job than he did. Whitney Moore, on the other hand, seems to be constantly embarrassed and therefore can&#x27;t stop smiling.The occasionally awkward dialogue is also worth mentioning: the scene in which Rod says that Becky &#x22;is taking a s**t. Nathalie is watching her back.&#x22; is certainly going to be remembered as a screen writing masterpiece. But the Oscar goes to Yeung Chang&#x27;s visual effects, if you dare call them that. He would have done a better job using Microsoft Paint.The music is awful, too. But it&#x27;s not as relevant as the message of this movie: Nguyen saw &#x27;An inconvenient truth&#x27; and thought it would be a good idea to make global warming the cause of the birds&#x27; madness, turning this movie into a bad horror with elements of ecological propaganda that nobody cares about. It actually makes you want to go and burn down a forest, just to make Nguyen sad. Which leads us to the obvious conclusion that everything in this movie is awful.Rating: 1/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/	1
Ever heard of so bad its funny? This takes the concept to a new level.	None	When I started watching this movie I thought of making some kind of intelligent commentary, but just a few minutes into the film, I gave up on that thought, and just tried to lean back, relax and enjoy the spectacle that is Birdemic.This film is absolutely awesome, awesomely bad but also awesomely funny. The acting is absolutely atrocious and there are long pauses in the dialog that make it even worse, but, it&#x27;s on such a level that bad translates to funny. Same thing with the CGI birds; they are exceptionally poorly done, there are high school students that can do better animations. It is absolutely hilarious to see these badly animated birds flap around. The story however is pretty boring, a large part of the movie is dedicated to this &#x22;slice of life&#x22; kind of stuff that I guess is supposed to establish the characters and the setting but it is thoroughly uninteresting. The only good part about it is how they squeeze in some kind of semi coherent environmental message about global warming, which they later bring up as the cause for the birds attacking.This is some quality bad movie material right here, I am just too aware of how horrendously bad it is that I can not score it higher than 3.	3
Laughable.	United States	This film is laughable. No, actually. Like if you want a good laugh with some friends, watch this movie.A group of my buddies and I were in stitches the entire time.Aside from the humorous aspect of this disaster, I&#x27;m afraid there is little-to-no-value in watching this. Birdemic suffers from terrible acting, poor video quality, an annoying soundtrack, lackluster special effects, forgettable characters, and a preachy ending. Not to mention the completely unnecessary amount of gore and sexual themes. I couldn&#x27;t tell if the alleged &#x22;environmentalist&#x22; message in this film was part of a conspiracy theory or just a joke...It&#x27;s difficult to find something I actually liked about the film. So I&#x27;m just going to end the review here.Just make sure to add Birdemic to your &#x22;terrible movie night&#x22; movie list and, when you do get to watching it, prepare to shake your head in disbelief at least a few times.	2
Um...I dont even know where to begin	United States	This is the worst movie ever made. I was not upset after I finished it because I didn&#x27;t feel it was a film maker doing an injustice to Film as a whole, I just felt it was an idiot using his parents old video camera and calling himself a director. The 1st problem I have with this....um...&#x22;thing&#x22; is that whoever was involved in this process couldn&#x27;t speak up and say &#x22;Um, Mr. Nguyen, what the fu*$ are we doing?&#x22; The 2nd problem is whenever someone tries to send a political message in a film, either you better know what you are talking about or at least do it somewhat well, because if you do it as shitty as this nutcase, you will look like a complete idiot and disgrace all your hippy friends...dear God! Sorry, even thinking about it hurts my brain.I will leave you with this. Watch the trailer, enough said. If you want a good laugh, watch &#x22;The Mary Tyler Moore Show,&#x22; don&#x27;t support this, it&#x27;s not film making...it&#x27;s Birdemic...Lord even the title makes me want to blow my brains out	1
This really could be the worst movie ever made.	United States	Shock and Terror? You better believe it. You will be shocked and terrified by how bad this movie is. I have seen a lot of bad movies but I can&#x27;t think of a single one that comes close to being as bad as Birdemic: Shock and Terror.The writer/director is totally inept and made the following mistakes: Included many long boring scenes of the characters driving very slowly, writing dialogue that is both boring and strange at the same time, and casting a space alien to play the main character.The &#x22;actor&#x22; who plays the hero of the piece, Rod, is devoid of personality, flubs lines, can&#x27;t enunciate, and can&#x27;t even walk like a normal human.Now for the story. For the first 45 minutes or so the movie seems to be a really lame advertisement for solar panels (or solapans as the main characters says it). The first half seems like a romantic comedy minus the comedy. There is no sign of the Birdemic until almost an hour into the movie. From then on the movie shifts gears and becomes a propaganda piece. It appears that global warming has not only caused the birdemic, but also deforestation via bark beetles. We learn this from a weirdo standing on a bridge and an even weirder guy who wears a bad wig and lives in a tree house. This is where the terror comes in.I give this tripe the lowest rating I can, 1 star out of 10. Either watch the rifftrax version or skip it entirely.	1
Truly the worst movie ever	United States	Remember those old 60&#x27;s sitcoms with the scary rubber bats on wires? The special effects in this one are worse. Even though they are CGI (circa 1993), the superimposed birds look more like paper cutouts than anything else. The main gal actually pulls off her role with some charm. The guy, not so much.This movie is so cheep (sorry) that they didn&#x27;t even bother to pay for using stock footage. Look for the &#x22;Getty Images&#x22; watermark on the racing footage during the newscast. And I don&#x27;t believe the director ever learned the word &#x22;Cut!&#x22;. This one far outshines what I had previously considered to be the best worst movie(s) I&#x27;d ever seen.	1
Shock and awe	United Kingdom	Birds that crash making plane sounds. Genius.I was also quite impressed with Rod as the gentleman seductive player. He has taught me a lot about how to deal with people i&#x27;m attracted to. The boardroom scene will be forever remembered. Next time i&#x27;m at work, I will make sure the clapping tempo has the exact variations.My brain is forever imprinted with this film, and as a film student I will try to live up to my new idol, James Nguyen.Natalie&#x27;s depiction as a victoria secret model puts Adriana Lima to shame. Hopefully they realize the mistakes they have been making with their model selection.	1
A completely awful piece of entertainment	New Jersey	WHY WHY WHY WHY?? Awful sound. Acting that makes Manos look like Citizen Kane. A story with more plot holes than The Room, in a bad way unlike in The Room when it was funny as all hell. Remaking a Hitchcock film has always failed in more ways than one. The plot is like if you watch An Inconvenient Truth while drinking as much you can while watching The Birds. They force this stupid moral of the save the environment in to your head that you just wanna mash your television. The sound makes an Atari 2600 game sound like HD surround sound for Crysis 2. You can barely hear what people are saying mainly because of background some effects. Music as well is pure crap, it&#x27;s all free down loadable music from the internet. Only watch this for RiffTrax. STAY AWAY FROM IT!	1
wow.........wtf is this crap???	United States	I created an account just so I could put a review out on this horrible film. In fact, my wife just finished watching all 3 minutes she was able to bear &#x26; seems to have gone into a coma. I&#x27;m going down to best buy right now to give this movie back. I have no idea what makes this person think he has the ability to make a movie. Do yourself a favor &#x26; go back to your job at mcdonalds &#x26; just give all your movie making equipment away. The acting was horrible, the &#x22;special&#x22; effects were...special. It was as though a chimp got on a computer, dropped some acid &#x26; said, &#x22;hey lets make a movie&#x22;. &#x26; then someone put it in a box &#x26; convinced a few of us to buy it. Money well spent if buying a movie you can&#x27;t finish watching is your thing. Wow...thats all I can say...	1
Not even entertainingly bad.	United States	Let me start by saying that I get the whole &#x27;It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s good thing.&#x22; I am a huge fan of The Room in fact. But this film, if you don&#x27;t mind embarrassing all other films by calling it that has absolutely no entertainment value. The acting is god-awful, it&#x27;s not funny either, it&#x27;s just horrible. The dialog makes no sense and doesn&#x27;t move the story forward at all. This is also the most slow-paced movie ever. Every scene is painstakingly dragged out. After watching for ten minutes it will seem like thirty. At the same time it feels like you&#x27;ve only been watching for one minute because absolutely nothing has happened. Not until half way through the movie does any action start. And when it does, you&#x27;ll wish it hadn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s horrible and indescribable. Before you decide to watch this movie try to watch a clip on youtube or something just so you know what you&#x27;re getting into. One last thing; the propaganda. This whole movie is some stupid preachy attempt to make people go green. A noble cause. But the stupidity of this movie made me resent the idea just because of how awfully it is portrayed. Long story short; DO NOT WATCH. Huge waste of time.	1
Ive seen better quality toilet seats, dripping in urine compared to this film.	England	Hmm, well this is an interesting film to review, I usually have a lot of fun reviewing films, which aren&#x27;t exactly at the top of the pile; this is way below anything I have watched before.So let&#x27;s start off and build our way up to how bad this film truly is; I&#x27;ve seen homemade porn not as bad as this is.1. Camera Work: Now, this is quite minimal in terms of how shoddy the rest of the film is, this is about as good as it gets. But even the camera work is flawed, sometimes the camera even misses the shot of the car it&#x27;s meant to be shooting; even got some suspicious looking wonky shots too (this could be due to the scenery, but I honestly swear and to be honest it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me; that some of the camera shots were not level). Overall the camera work was definitely filmed by an amateur or worse, it&#x27;s like watching a homemade movie filmed by your druggie uncle; who makes a living recording his seedy homemade sex videos and sells them on for heroine; but that&#x27;s another story.2. Editing: This slowly creeps its way up the ladder in terms of severity, camera work of course being the least worse, in this melting pot of &#x27;shock and terror&#x27;, ha, see what I did there? Anyway, the editing is very bad indeed. It&#x27;s like watching a film made by a 15 year old, pizza faced teenager at secondary school (high school for you flash Americans). One scene which shows this the most is with the celebrating-in-the-office-board-meeting thing, it&#x27;s quite vague; but I can&#x27;t for the life of me actually remember what that scene was about; apart from a lot of clapping and applauding (literally a lot of clapping and applauding, with lots of dodgy cuts in between). Overall, not good, I mean I can do better with my video editing skills. I may sound really big headed, but I KNOW I can, and film it better.3. Sound: This is very bad, in the first opening line spoken by two of the actors in the caf&#xE9;, the audio straight away clips and breaks. I mean, I would give this film some credit and possibly 3 stars if everything else was but the sound was okay, but that&#x27;s not going to happen, I can bet my left nut on it.4. Acting/Directing/Writing: Decided to include this together, as to be able to make five points, instead of seven. The acting is very wooden, all the actors used are unknown or new talent picked up from the street; where they got them from I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s as if the Director just popped down the supermarket and thought, &#x22;she&#x27;s got a nice pair of breasts, let&#x27;s use her!&#x22; not that he did that with his male casting too. The overall writing from what I can tell is very basic, most of the dialog is basically one line sentences; with very limited plot development among the characters. This film just basically says, &#x22;look birds!&#x22; and, &#x22;oh quick, got to shoot the birds and run away!&#x22; Don&#x27;t even get me started on the directing...5. Special Effects (lack of): Finally, the best of the best! Well worst of the low in this scenario. The special effects look as though they have been made by a child with a hard on for GIF animation. The birds in this film are ridiculous, when I first saw the film trailer, I originally thought it was someone&#x27;s film project from college which was being linked to me; was only until I checked here at IMDb that I got the full picture. It&#x27;s full of over the top muzzle flashes too, when I say over the top; I should probably say very little. I mean okay, the special effects look fake anyway, but the muzzle flashes are too small for a start anyway; don&#x27;t add insult to injury James!Jesus Christ, I mean I have never had so much to say for one film in my entire life, this doesn&#x27;t even get anywhere near the infamous Silent Night Deadly Night 2, in terms of production value and acting. This film beats every bad film I know of out there. But let&#x27;s not get too hasty shall we, for example this film has it&#x27;s uses, I watched this film knowing it was going to bad; I almost died from laughing too much at the film. This is a film to watch with a group of friends, some pizza and preferably some alcohol; maybe even some hard class a drugs if you&#x27;re feeling rebellious!So yeah, watch it, but be warned, this is terrible, it&#x27;s quite boring too. After the sensation of laughing at how bad the film is, you tend to find your hand reaching for the fast forward button.But yeah, well done James, you made an amazing film. (Please don&#x27;t quote this in your next film trailer).	1
what a pathetic excuse for a film	New Zealand	If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I was watching this dumpsterpiece movie with four friends, I would be bashing my head against something hard, and questioning the very usefulness of my life. In other words, yes, this movie was THAT bad. I&#x27;ve heard that Birdemic was supposed to be a very bad, very cheap rip off of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds, but Lord almighty! Fifteen minutes into it I was starting to panic.Rod (Alan Bagh), is a Silicon Valley software designer yuppie who has just made it big. Not to mention he always walks like he wears a back brace. He&#x27;s about to land a deal that will make him a millionaire, because this movie certainly won&#x27;t do that. Also, he drives my dream car (a Ford Mustang), and always drives about 20 mph below the speed limit. Have some respect, dude. But anyway, Rod goes into a diner and meets Natalie (Whitney Moore) by first asking &#x22;didn&#x27;t you go to high school with me?&#x22; Natalie is also a very hot blonde aspiring model, who just happens to give her phone number to a guy like Rod, whom she barely knows. That&#x27;s basically the first half of the movie, a romance blossoming. On top of that, there are stories about the ice caps melting, and swarms of eagles dying. Uh oh, does this mean Al Gore was right? One night, Rod and Natalie go to a cheap motel to have loving, but emotionless sex. All of a sudden, swarms of eagles are going around, swarming people, killing people, and blowing up houses by ramming into them like kamikaze pilots. Now, it&#x27;s up to this young couple to try to find survivors, and kill birds. Soon along the way, we meet Dr. Jones (Rick Camp), who tells us that we screwed up this planet, created global warming, and now birds are killing everybody.So .where to begin with this movie? First off, it has probably the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie that&#x27;s not a porno. I would say the acting was as wooden as Pinocchio, but Pinocchio actually DOES become a real boy at the end. There was no hope for this movie at all. I saw this being sold on blu ray for $25. I don&#x27;t even think this movie cost 25 cents to make! Just watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean. Everything about this movie sucked. The script was so badly written, it was almost a tragicomedy. At least Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds had robotic birds. Okay, the CGI buzzards that were attacking people, I think the editing machines in a public access TV studio are more sophisticated. Plus, there were a lot of underlying themes about global warming here. If these environmentalist screenwriters wanted to convince me to stop contributing to greenhouse gasses, they&#x27;re going to have to do better that Birdemic. I seriously hope the filmmakers weren&#x27;t taking this too seriously, because it&#x27;s such a joke.I love B rate movies, and I like playing &#x22;Mystery Science Theater 3000&#x2033; with them. But this movie made Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. Some of these lines are so awful: &#x22;Humans need to stop playing cowboys with nature.&#x22; When people were attacked by birds, they were more or less being attack by a Windows 3.1 screensaver. I would have made a better movie when I was in middle school. What else do I have to say? Just go online and watch the trailer, that will visualize everything. I&#x27;m all for cheap filmmaking, but this is just pushing it.I leave you with this thought. I mentioned earlier that I was watching this colostomy bag of a movie with four friends, where we made sarcastic remarks. My thought is maybe this is why bad movies are made, why Birdemic was made&#x96;to bring in more social gatherings.	1
Move over, Ed Wood. No seriously, get off the papier-mch throne	The Divided States of Earth	It&#x27;s unbelievable that APPARENTLY &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; is unintentionally so inept. After seeing the movie I was borderline convinced that it&#x27;s a product of ingenious comedy filmmakers but the DVD special features taught me better. One way or the other auteur Nguyen must be consumed with Hollywood movies or rather with all of their clich&#xE9;s. Basically what the film does brilliantly throughout is to use movie clich&#xE9;s so obviously and so poorly that it exposes those clich&#xE9;s. You inevitably realize how the filmmakers are trying to manipulate the viewer rendering its manipulatory attempts ineffective but not without reminding you that it does nothing else than what most action-y big budget movies do and you think to yourself: &#x22;Even if done well, how could I ever fall for such stupidity in other movies?&#x22; It exposes the fabric of movie-making itself and therefore if you watch &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; attentively you will never see an overly manipulative or clich&#xE9;-ridden movie the same way again.There&#x27;s the story arc of establishing the hero with a romance before it turns into the movie we actually want to see. This one does it as jarringly as possible, the first 50 minutes are literally a romance almost without any forbidding of impending doom. OK, there&#x27;s the title sequence music that blobs about repetitively like Torgo&#x27;s theme in &#x27;&#x27;Manos&#x27; The Hands of Fate&#x27; wishing it was Bernard Hermann&#x27;s &#x27;Psycho&#x27; theme that was used so effectively 50 years ago with Janet Leigh behind the wheel. And there&#x27;s the couple watching parrots fly about a tree and finding a dead eagle on the beach...unnecessarily all done in CGI, by the way, just as is common practice in modern cinema, practical effects just aren&#x27;t accepted by modern movie going audiences anymore, it must be CGI no matter how bad it looks, it&#x27;s called suspension of disbelief (while practical effects are just rubbish, period). So there you have it folks. Anyway, so at the 50-minute mark the movie suddenly shriekingly turns into a disaster movie from one second to the next (not counting the one minute &#x22;establishing shot montage&#x22; preceding it).Want more stereotype and clich&#xE9; debunking? Don&#x27;t worry, &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; delivers them relentlessly. The heroic protagonist who gets the bombshell and has not only one big career success in the movie but about three - in, like, two days - is a stoic, stupid black hole of charisma, the stereotypical &#x22;a guy like you and me&#x22; who succeeds anyway. The female lead likes everything he does and she&#x27;s won over by the guy despite his &#xFC;ber-dorkyness, personalitylessness and stalker-like behavior but not without lighting up the screen in every frame of the film with her amazing smile as if she was walking a red carpet, yeah, even during the bird attacks. Of course she also strikes a big career success when she gets a cover model for Victoria Secret gig, you know, &#x22;just a regular fashion model like you and me&#x22;.Characters who are unlikely to have ever used a gun in their lives (a software salesman and a fashion model?) pull guns out of their &#x22;asses&#x22; and shoot them like pros without fear or remorse. Characters that are only relevant for one scene (if even that) are literally out of the picture when they aren&#x27;t needed (hey, they are just in the car&#x27;s back seat and REALLY quiet, that&#x27;s all) and are back once they have to be. Between bird attacks the characters are as careless as can be. So careless that they take a break from escaping the attacking birds by having a picnic outdoors with their kidnapped children who just lost their parents and whose only purpose in the film (apart from getting &#x22;rescued&#x22; by our the-second-coming-of-Siegfried protagonist) is to bitch that they are hungry and that instead of fresh fish they want a Happy Meal&#xAE;.There&#x27;s a theme that runs through the whole film as is typical for even the most shallow disaster movie but this one really rubs it into the viewer&#x27;s face. At times (well, for most of its running time, actually) it plays like an ad for solar power or a raising awareness ad for global warming. The main character is shown how he is &#x22;going green&#x22; during the course of the movie without bearing any relevance to the story, and not only figuratively but literally as well, the guy&#x27;s and the girl&#x27;s wardrobe gets increasingly greener starting subtly with a light green tie until by the end their clothes are all green. Clearly Nguyen learned about subtext from the greatest of filmmakers.But seriously, &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; had me from minute one with production logos and credits being displayed without any sense of rhythm. During the opening credits (which for example credit a &#x22;Patsy vanEttinger&#x22;, yes, without a space between van and the last name) we watch a Mustang driving on a country road at a snail&#x27;s pace. In one scene a small tow truck with a load is stuck behind the Mustang, that&#x27;s how slow he goes. And he continues to drive this slow throughout the entire film. Did I mention that sometimes the camera operator still is unable to keep the Mustang inside the frame when panning? Now THAT is comedy. 30 minutes in the guy mentions that his Mustang is a hybrid car. Ha, that explains everything. Subtly making the thing that the movie is a commercial for look bad. Nice gag. One among thousands since every other edit in the film is a joke. If you can laugh about horribly poor editing this is the movie for you. Really, it&#x27;s quite astonishing that a digitally shot movie could have a glaring error like cutting to characters who are supposed to be in the middle of an action but are actually seen at the beginning of the shot for the director to yell action so they can start running.	8
A Truly Awful Film!!!	United States	This movie is so dumb and stupid, that it&#x27;s laughable. After watching it a 2nd time with friends, it&#x27;s a little better, but that&#x27;s not saying much. The lead actor is always talking about his lame job, the sound is choppy, the birds are incredibly fake looking, the actors are terrible, and they talk about global warming every 10 minutes. Rod is a software salesman who runs into a fashion model named Natalie. They show their melodramatic love story until finally the birdemic starts. (It takes 47 minutes for the birds to start attacking) When they attack, that&#x27;s when the fun of this movie begins. When they shoot at the birds, it&#x27;s like the old Nintendo game, Duck Hunt. Rod and Natalie meet up with survivors and help two kids who lost their parents, but don&#x27;t seem to care enough. Will they survive? This movie is worth a watch. It&#x27;s so bad, it has to be seen to be believed. I would recommend BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR!!!	2
Ive seen better special effects from the 1940s.	New Zealand	This movie actually made me feel like a terrible person.I&#x27;m not even joking. This sh*t was even worse than &#x27;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&#x27; which is saying something.The acting was worse than anything I have seen before, the audio cut out randomly, and the &#x22;Special Effects&#x22; GOD DAMN, THOSE &#x22;Effects&#x22; WERE TERRIBLE.I regret watching this crap, I want my life back. And guess what? There&#x27;s a sequel. And the tag-line? &#x22;You asked for it&#x22;No. We did NOT ask for it. We asked for it to be purged from the world, and all copies immediately seized. NOT for another, equally terrible sequel.Oh, did I also mention that the plot MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER?	1
A Masterpiece	United Kingdom	This film sucks a giant donkey&#x27;s wiener; nothing makes sense with meaningless characters, god awful special effects, and don&#x27;t get me started on the acting - BUT - I love this film simply because I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing, and laughing, and laughing, and laughing.If laughter is the best medicine, this&#x27;ll heal cancer.The plot is something to do with birds or something, I don&#x27;t really care what the plot is because when I first saw those birds dive bombing into buildings I fell off the sofa and on to the, harder than I thought, wooden floor.You may start watching this film and almost immediately give up from the long driving scene and windows movie maker opening credits, but you got to stay strong because before you know it a girl gets killed by a bird while peeing on the side of the road.In conclusion - A masterpiece of cinema.	10
One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made	Canada	We rented this movie today (April 9, 2011) thinking that it would be a good movie; we were both surprised at how bad it is. The sound comes and goes from time to time, the picture quality is good, not much for horror scenes, and the birds when they attack looks so fake; like a video game.We have seen our share of bad movies but, this one takes the cake; I would not recommend this movie at all unless the person is that bored and willing to watch this kind of cheesy class b movie.I have noticed that there is supposed to be a part 2 to this movie; I don&#x27;t think I will be renting it, it&#x27;s supposed to be in 3D too but, if it&#x27;s as bad as this one; forget it, I won&#x27;t waste my money or time.This is more of a made for TV movie, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for TV either; I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they did this movie.	1
Not A Review	London, England	By now you&#x27;ve probably all read enough about how poorly crafted Birdemic is on every level.Sure, it&#x27;s bad. Bad bad bad even.Perhaps a little too bad?Is there a human being in the world that couldn&#x27;t turn in a better performance than the leading man?Wouldn&#x27;t wranglers with bird puppets be more believable?This is just an observation, but it doesn&#x27;t appear that anyone from this cast or crew has taken their lives or died under mysterious circumstances shortly after Birdemic&#x27;s release. Isn&#x27;t that standard fare for the worst movies of all time? Another reason to believe this was a calculated cult classic.	2
Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	United Kingdom	Why do I want to write the 5th comment on Birdemic? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that affects me as strongly is Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn&#x27;t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like Bird-attack movies and I don&#x27;t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking Birdemic out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, &#x22;Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.&#x22; At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.The allusions to real-life are both subtle and prophetic. Non-stop action combines with stunning special effects to portray the inherent struggle that humans face against killer eagles and vultures around the world on a daily basis; this film might just be the inspiration needed for governments to tackle this global problem.Birdemic and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it&#x27;s technical merits - I don&#x27;t really care about that. I have read that the Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Birdemic to touch the soul.	10
Junk	Hungary	Nguyen instantly re-establishes his signature style with a long opening credits sequence in which simply capturing a protagonist walking down a street &#x97; in this case, Hollywood Boulevard &#x97; mightily challenges the acting and directorial skills on tap. Bill (Thomas Favaloro) is a successful indie director whose career has stalled since his last film, a mainstream Hollywood flop. Arriving at a restaurant for a meeting, he promptly sizes up waitress Gloria (Chelsea Turnbo) as a possible leading lady in what seems like a sleazy casting-couch manner, though there&#x27;s no indication Nguyen sees it that way. ill&#x27;s lunch dates are the first film&#x27;s leads: old friend Rob (Alan Bagh), a Silicon Valley-enriched millionaire, and Natalie (Whitney Moore), his model-turned-aspiring-actress ff. Rob commits to funding Bill&#x27;s comeback feature about the struggle to make it in Hollywood, the pro tags expressing awe that the subject&#x27;s never been done before. That settled, the four of them (now including Gloria, cast in the lead) traipse off to enjoy themselves at various Los Angeles attractions; these include the La Brea Tar Pits, where, for reasons murkily attributed to global warming, prehistoric eagles and vultures arise from the muck to attack humans.	1
I Abhorre this movie	None	Birdemic: Shock and Terror, the title perfectly displays how I feel about this movie, Shocked at how awful it is and in terror of as to why this movie was even made. However somehow my friend Danny seemingly enjoyed the special effects especially those rotating in circles and he said that its is the best movie he&#x27;s ever seen. He said the dive-bombing birds were particularly captivating. I however thought the effects looked like they were done with Windows Movie Maker or Scratch. Don&#x27;t watch this film, it is a waste of your life watch Rubber instead it is much more provocative and a better all round family film and includes fantastic actors, and a very interesting concept for a film, easy to understand and side-splitting entertainment for only 80 minutes.	1
Bad	Hell	&#x22;Hi, the eagles killed our friends- uh- do you have a phone I could use to call the police?&#x22;I fail to conjure words to describe this movie. This is the kind of movie you buy just so that when people come over and see it they say that they never heard of it and you&#x27;re like &#x22;wanna watch it&#x22; and they&#x27;re like &#x22;sure&#x22; so you put it on, sneak out the back-door, move to Mexico, and change your name. Bad acting, bad audio, bad CG, bad plot, BAD MOVIE. Just imagine what was going through those &#x22;actors&#x22; heads when they where swinging at nothing with wire hangers.I give it a 1/10- buy it and give it to someone you hate.	1
bad	Unknown	what isn&#x27;t crappy about this movie IDs! But what is: The acting The plot The characters The special effect AND even more WATCH IT NOW! AND YOU&#x27;ll LAUGH :) Now i&#x27;m just filling the lines but i can assure you this is one of those movies that&#x27;s good because its bad it should actually be number 1 because well it is bad even worse than dutch movies which suck too i can&#x27;t recommend dutch movies tho because they&#x27;re not bad enough to be good and funny no they are just plain bad IMDb WHY 10 LINES WHY!!!:( have you guys seen kingsman that one is really good :) and i&#x27;ld recommend that for everyone because it has tons of actions and a good story srry for my bad English btw :(	1
Beyond Painful	None	I found myself moaning and groaning and writhing for the first 20 minutes of watching this torturously embarrassing assault on my emotions &#x97; not because it was shocking or terrifying, but because it inadvertently contained every possible characteristic of bad filmmaking. The only reason I stopped suffering was because I began fast-forwarding. The only good things about this &#x22;film&#x22; were seeing locations that I recognized, and seeing a few attractive actresses in bikinis. Thank God they didn&#x27;t do any nude scenes. These poor young ladies would have lost chunks of their souls had they exposed themselves for the sake of absolutely the worst cinematic creation possible. Watching it made me ashamed to be human. I knew Birdemic would be bad, but I thought it might be fun to watch a cheesy horror film. It wasn&#x27;t. And I know you will think that what I&#x27;m about to write next is an exaggeration, but I swear to you it is not: I recently got a molar pulled in the dentist&#x27;s office, and this experience was far more enjoyable and far less painful than watching Birdemic. In the words of Joaquin Phoenix&#x27;s character in the movie 8MM, &#x22;There are some things that you see, and you can&#x27;t unsee them.&#x22; Don&#x27;t let Birdemic be one of them.	1
The holy grail of movies.	Australia	11/10, a masterpiece of cinematography. Way too under-rated/appreciated. The use of shots and sound gives you a really intense and emotional experience. If you have not witnessed the &#x22;Shock and Terror&#x22;, I feel sorry for you. I can not praise this film enough. I can not pick out one mistake in this film. The editing is phenomenal. It hits all the right notes in all the right places. Please, please, watch this movie. You definitely won&#x27;t regret it. It definitely signifies and shows how much the film industry has evolved. The CGI in this film can not be matched. My favourite scene hands down is when they fight the almost photo realistic birds with coat hangers, never in my life have i seen such a real and vivid display of true courage and bravery. I can not see how the actors and actresses in this film have not won any awards. Has the film critics become blind to absolute genius? This film for what it is worth should have been critically acclaimed but sadly no recognition has been given to this master-piece. Definitely the highlight of my life. Must watch.	10
Birdemic: Shock and Terror Or as I call it Birdemic: Stock and Error.	None	I first found out about this movie from a Jontron Review of it, so I decided to watch it, and I am literally speechless. It&#x27;s so freaking(not going to swear cause I might not be allowed to) bad! How bad do you ask? So 100,000,000 times bad! Looking at a rock all day would be better than this movie. Here are my reasons:1.) Terrible effects, since it had no studio support.2.) The conflict of the plot occurs 40 minutes later in the movie. And the conflict scene just shows up. *Sighs* Where did they even get this idea?3.) The acting was bad, but the guy who played Rod did his acting horrifically terrible. I&#x27;ve seen wood, but nothing is terrible than this guy.4.) The birds are just floating around doing nothing when they attack. They just hover around. Even when they attack the main characters while they try to get in their car. Comeon Becky! Turn those god darn keys! 5.) &#x22;So you&#x27;re a tree hugger?&#x22; lol6.) They forgot the gas tank while they were trying to get away. No wonder he ran out of gas. Should&#x27;ve thought of that...7.) You also get to see everything this guy does. (Warning: Spoiler!) You don&#x27;t do that in a horror movie.8.) The main characters&#x27; names are just Rod and Nathalie... No last names? 9.) The ending sucks. The birds just get chased away by doves. Doves... Yeah they just fly away. What is the point of that. 10.) Out of the most ridiculous of this, is the sex scene. The way he looks at her in her underwear just kills me. &#x22;No! Oh god! Nope stop! Now you stop that foot s*** right now!&#x22; -Jontron Those are the reasons why this movie is terrible. Also the scene on the bridge does remind me of the hermit that asks questions on the Bridge of Death in Monty Python&#x27;s Quest for the Holy Grail. &#x22;What....is your favorite color?&#x22; This is what I think of the movie. Also this was made with a budget of $10,000,	1
Shock and terror indeed...	None	Birdemic: Shock and Terror is the kind of movie that you know you want to see right after you saw the trailer. With something along the Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds in mind and $10.000 to spend, James Nguyen decided to make a movie. And what a movie... Almost everything is wrong about Birdemic. Acting is awful, editing is bad, camera work is bad. The cherry on the cake must be special effects. There is something special about them. Some combination between a 12 years old learning to use an graphic software and an 80 years old grandpa making sure everything is in place. Add all of the above with some &#x22;in your face&#x22; environmental message, and a love story, and you got the recipe for one of the worst movies ever made. I must admit that the music is kinda good. I bet that the guy that made it though that will be his breakthrough. You can hear his struggle in making the best soundtrack he ever made for Birdemic. The guy that made special effects, on the other hand, was like &#x22;well, motion stuff, yea, i can do those, i made some greeting cards last year!&#x22;. I must give one point for the courage the director had to throw such a big idea with so less money. Props for him!Definitely a must watch if you are interested into &#x22;so bad is good&#x22; category of movies.	2
Deadly comedy?	Bulgaria	Birdemic shock and terror is one stupid/funny movie with incredibly bad acting let&#x27;s don&#x27;t talk about the special effects the story is just ridiculous it&#x27;s just stupid so stupid it&#x27;s funny .I can&#x27;t tell if the people making this film we&#x27;re really trying to make it good or bad it&#x27;s just funny there were some scenes in the movie that i burst out laughing.like that moment when the eagles where falling in to the buildings or when they were trying to kill the eagles the sound effects were absolutely stupid.Birdemic shock and terror a movie about deadly eagles turns out to be just one great comedy.	1
THE BIRDS... with bad CGI!	United States	THE BIRDS, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s legendary doomsday film. Taken from a short story, equally terrifying, it depicts an epidemic of bird attacks. In that film, we had seagulls, eagles, hawks, and the iconic crows all attacking people without any reason. It left audiences feeling haunted, especially with the downbeat finale. Between 1963 and 2010, filmmakers have been trying to return to that grandiose sense of avian terror. The closest they&#x27;ve ever come is RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION. But the difference between the two? RE:E featured CGI whereas Hitchcock used real birds. And when it&#x27;s done well, it&#x27;s extraordinary. BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR is a film about an apocalypse of birds. But it features laughably bad CGI. (Come on, birds don&#x27;t fly with their feet hanging down!) And that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg. In the story, our hero asks a girl out on a date. And after some asinine dialogue, they have a romantic night. Only to wake up and discover... AH, THE BIRDS ARE ATTACKING! Now, they&#x27;re on the run, and trying to survive the flying pixels. Firing their guns (where&#x27;d they suddenly get those?) that are clearly toy guns. Once in a while, one of the survivors will die from being stupid. Leaving us rolling in the aisles, literally. I think there might have even been a character or two who died twice. The acting is excruciating, as you can probably imagine. Along with cinematography (they filmed with cheap video cameras), editing, music, scriptwriting, and directing. Sadly, the copy I stopped working about fifty minutes in. But that was more than enough. Maybe that was a sign from above? Now I see why this earns the NUMBER 1 spot as the WORST FILM OF ALL TIMES!	1
Birds attacking people, where have I heard that before	England	This was shown in theatres! Are you kidding me?Problem 1: Story; it&#x27;s taken from Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds Problem 2: Acting; it&#x27;s wooden (I think a plank of wood would have been a better casting choice, now that you think about it. Problem 3: The birds do not stat killing people until the halfway point. Problem 4: Dialogue is on The Room level. Problem 5: No Redeeming features. Problem 6: It SUCKS! Problem 7: Low production values. Problem 8: College film level quality in editing and shooting. One minute it&#x27;s okay, the next it looks bad Problem 9: Awful CGI and effects.Overall, this is the worst film I have seen yet. There is nothing good in this pile of cinematic excrement.	1
A boy meets a girl who is a model and they develop a love relationship. But suddenly a lot of birds attack, and kills many people. No one knows why.	None	Okay. So I have now seen Birdemic and my feelings are a big chaos. I don&#x27;t know where to begin. If you take the most stiff actors of the century, making them speak a lot of lines of total bullshit (such as surrealistic pick-up lines and strange dialogues), in a story without any point at all, combined with movie effects that not even the 90&#x27;s can be excused for, and mash it up with the most terrible sound you could ever imagine and music that could be taken directly from The Sims, then you get Birdemic: Shock and Terror.To begin with new nothing happens for approximately 45 minutes. It all seems to be about a guy who meets a future Victoria&#x27;s Secret Model, something he does not seem to be impressed about. At least not from the acting. The actors&#x27; facial and talking expressions seem to be a nothing but a desperate &#x22;take me out of here!&#x22;, thinking about their total lack of enthusiasm. Anyway, they fall in love, and that&#x27;s all you need to know since barely anything else happens.Somewhere in these 45 minutes you will see a total of three birds. The story is said to be about birds, so you will sit there for a while wondering whenever something related to birds will happen. Or if it ever will happen. Anyway, these three birds are weirdly bad made. We know this movie only had a budget of 10 000$ but I don&#x27;t even know if that can be an excuse. The effects from gun shots and the wildfire that suddenly breaks out look like something that was made in Paint in 5 minutes, and the animated birds at the rest of the movie when they appear seem to be breaking the laws of physics, with the terrible and unrealistic motion of theirs.But the worst thing with this movie might be the sound. I don&#x27;t even think they actually had any microphone except for the one at the camera. Some lines disappear into all noise that the sound technician totally forgot to clean up, the volume changes all throughout the movie, and sometimes there is no sound at all. The music, from which I almost got feels from my childhood where I sat making families and pretending to be some kind of architect, doesn&#x27;t fit with the story or scenes at all, and the entire film might be better if you just could delete it all.Birdemic is a film in the genres horror, thriller, and romance, and the director James Nguyen is describing himself as &#x22;the Master of romantic thrillers&#x22;. Well.To sum it up, this is the most terrible movie I&#x27;ve ever seen and any movie is better than this. I don&#x27;t even see how this could be distributed since it all feels more like some kind of parody. An incredibly bad one. But strangely, the film actually does entertain. You will probably laugh your ass off.Peace.	1
The Godfather is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made	United Kingdom	Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.	10
Magnificent portrait of organized crime	EU	This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a must see masterpiece.	10
Another kind of family movie	nowhere	The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for gangster movies, but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every organized crime film nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply influential is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as a movie about gangsters. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his innocence and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos&eacute; of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.	10
perfect	Winnipeg	This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.	10
The Greatest Movie Ever Made	Yorktown	The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy.	9
Initially, I wasnt a fan... but then I realised	Australia	This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didnt like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brandos ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Dons children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation theyre put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the characters character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isnt to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isnt mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.	10
The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!	Worcester, England	The Godfather is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed The Godfather I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So lets start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, I believe in America, its crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the films threshold. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970s film industry (including a certain horses head), The Godfather epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleones are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywoods greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.	10
A Masterpiece	Casa Nostra	This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one mans reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!	10
This Movie Has Haunted My Life...	United States	I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.	10
The world inside the underworld!	United States	The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, Oh that was 10 out of 10. If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy	10
For me it isn't the greatest ever, but it's still great	New York City	Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving business guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again? The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to 11 doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of oscillating dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) zoom out from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the greatest film of all time hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a historical family saga as a crime or gangster film.	10
The Godfather	Marietta, OH	Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.	10
An exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances...	Mexico	The Godfather is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal families, and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times... With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by liquor, gambling, and even women... He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the sovereignty. In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment Never to take sides against the Family. The opening shot of The Godfather sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie big shot named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact...	10
An Epic, Masterful Look into the Underground World	United States	The Godfather simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best Ive ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie Ive ever seen or will ever see. Its also one of the most precise and intricate films Ive ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching The Godfather, is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppolas direction is what brings this film, thats so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. Hes the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonnys (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, Thats my family, Kay. Thats not me. We get the feeling that Michaels nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. Hes the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the familys actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. Hes treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leaders confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he cant refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino shinning moment in the film. Theres no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) gets upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredos height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, Fredo, dont ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.Thats some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michaels change believable. Hes not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as hes capable of turning on anyone and using the line, Its strictly business when it comes to family issues. Michaels sister, Connie, calls him a cold hearted bastard at the end of the film. Its hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino performance is that he doesnt sugarcoat it. He doesnt try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. Thats the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and lets us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like The Godfather, that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.	10
A film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema	Tunbridge Wells, England	Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10	8
An Iconic Film	Queens, New York	Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you cant. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich&eacute;. His performance though was not a clich&eacute;. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horses head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, Ill give him an offer he cant refuse and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I dont know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.	10
One Can See Why Its So Highly-Rated	United States	Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldnt quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because its understandable. It also has a memorable score.One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because its so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didnt rate it as high as others was I didnt like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la Bonnie & Clyde, that was fine with me!There isnt as much violence as people might think, if theyve never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. Thats part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its business.Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.I am also fortunate to own The Godfather Epic on tape, which must be some sort of collectors item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. Its well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I dont see it listed on IMDb.	9
Great look at a family based around crime	United Kingdom	Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.  Now that's respect.	8
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus	India	The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesnt depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it wont be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/	10
Count Me In The Minority	Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada	First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought The Godfather was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's business never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family business to the eventual Don.It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10	6
Slightly overrated	Twin Cities	One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred Goodfellas. The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10	8
The Greatest Film of All Time !  Period.	United States	This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems too old or young for the part. Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem out of place or unconvincing. The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times youve seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS The Godfather Saga (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.	10
Make More Something Like this...	Latvia	The Godfather is as good as everyone says it is. It a near flawless film that achieves so much with so little. What it has is a fantastic script, amazing cast and a director with a vision. No fancy tricks, gimmicks, 3D or any other crap. The Godfather is template on which films should be made but ,sadly, they dont do it. Just like Jackie Brown, Infernal Affairs, Il Mare, Daisy, Heat, Network, Glory, Dog Day Afternoon, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Manhunter, My Sassy Girl and so on, The Godfather takes its time to develop its characters, allows you to enjoy the performances with slow and steady direction and makes a great use of atmosphere. I love films that allow us to sit down and enjoy a story with very strong characters. Ill take The Godfather over Avengers, Dark Knights, Pulp Fictions any day.Its nearly impossible to name all the great things that are in Godfather. The cast is terrific with some our greatest actors of all time: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, John Cazale, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and so on. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola s fantastic and his co-written script with Mario Puzo is flawless. And I can keep naming positives all day...There really isnt much to be said about The Godfather, but Im very sad that there isnt a lot of films that are like it, especially in Hollywood. I dont mean gangster films but films that are slow moving, with strong characters, engaging story and beautiful visuals. South Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong and Europe are the only places to look for those nowadays... The Godfather is a film for an adult. Its made for people that can appreciate a great storytelling and all the craftsmanship put into it. I dont see it as a gangster movie but as a complex family drama. Godfather should be seen by anyone who considers himself a fan of film and film making.	10
Best movie ever	Romania	I love this movie. Its the greatest movie I ever seen in my life. Every time I watch it I see something new. It has drama, action and even comedy. The story is great. It centers around the most powerful New York mafia run by The Godfather. It teaches you about family and betrayal, about life in general. All that Michael does is for his family. He even sacrifices his relationship with his girlfriend to protect his family. The movie is amazingly shot, giving it amazing light. The characters are bigger than life and played by some of the greatest actors to ever live. The soundtrack is very good. All in all is must see.	10

The Pioneer of All Filmmaking	Leesburg, Florida	The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. Hes my role model. The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast! The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. Thats why hes my role model. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. Its awesome.	10
mafia	Turkey	God Father came to the best mafia movie history owes the beauty of the depth of the event although not touching the films screenwriter. Generally greater than all of the family prominent in Mafia movies keep the subject here treated as.  But if the head is feeling lonely (in every sense) family and professional life is no longer the way it was put right.  God Father 1 and 2 family integrity while maintaining almost 3 arises where I also ended up in the film.  There is also something that should not be forgotten alone; When thick to go through every stage of life between the stay should be limits to what the best deals are to be considered.	10
The Finest American Cinema Has To Offer	Kentucky, United States	It has been said so many times that it seems clich, but I wil continue to say it. The Godfather is one of he greatest movies ever made. Words cannot express how well the film combines all the elements a film needs, to be good. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is great, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this movie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this movie, and is expertly brought to life.The beginning of the film starts out at the wedding of Don Vito Corleones daughter, Connie. At the wedding reception we are introduced to the many of the members of the Corleone crime family, however not all of them are part of the family business. At the wedding, Vitos youngest son, Michael, tells his then girlfriend, Kay, that he was not like his family. Throughout the rest of the film, we see Michael Corleone transform into the very thing he claims he hates. Its an excellent example of how character growth should be done.From the intriguing beginning where we find Vito Corleone being asked for favors, to the climatic ending where Michael finishes his transformation, The Godfather is a landmark film in American cinema.	10
Great movies are not born great, they are made great.	Kolkata, India	I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, Is it The Godfather level good or not ?.This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldnt find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfathers mansion. All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of Bravo!. This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.	10
A elegiac and well organize American Crime drama, that hits home with what it means to die for your family.	United States	Its a bit difficult to find a part, a moment, within the film that doesnt showcase great acting, story-telling, and a heart to what it means to have honor and pride. A well deserved film. Brandos brilliance is showcased within The Godfather. Al Pacino is a the seed that is placed within the story, who continually grows throughout by the light of his father. Although, some seeds are worth pulling. The undertone of the story is the concept of corruption and the fall of an empire, and a start to a new one. Fracis Ford Coppolas masterpiece, an everlasting mark on American Cinema. Definitely a piece of history, and youre along for the ride, and experiencing the visceral feeling of that era.	10
Review	None	The few perfect films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppolas revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern cinema, Coppolas The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rotas breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppolas very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather.	10
Masterpiece	Spain	Its hard to find a moment in the film that isnt great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. The Godfather is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.You cant miss this movie.	10
Im going to make him an offer he cant refuse.	United States	One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vitos only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vitos bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleones lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and its easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because thats what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it.	10
The Best Movie of all time	Iran	The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all gangster movies have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfathers success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vitos youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their adopted brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the dons right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vitos refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (its therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from innocent bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Next to Humphrey Bogarts Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brandos Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (A man who doesnt spend time with his family can never be a real man) and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the throne, is one of The Godfathers most revealing moments (about both father and son).The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, its surprising that Duvall wasnt passed over. His presence in The Godfather isnt flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caans Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality cant be overlooked.Family responsibility. A fathers legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppolas cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New Yorks Italian crime families. The word Mafia conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.	10
Perhaps the Greatest of All Time?	None	I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i havent thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and thats when i decided to take a chance with Godfather. I wasnt a fan of gangster flicks so its fair to say i never thought id sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDbs 250)I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.Im not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up! In my opinion The Greatest Gangster Film ever. And Arguably the greatest movie of all time. 10 out of 10.	6
Mario Puzo's soapy Mafia saga	United Kingdom	Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s.	8
This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.	Cincinnati, OH, United States	The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or dont, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleones family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rotas immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michaels ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his fathers standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfathers function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, theres a look about him as if hes just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brandos performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isnt time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Williss reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vitos wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonnys wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vitos life alters Michaels attitude, and he comes back to help defend his familys wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michaels bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the films most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.	10
Sets the standard for the gangster art film.	Massachusetts	The Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film auteur. Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubricks philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfathers brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleones daughter, not only establishes the Dons character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Dons world and legitimate society. For instance, the films opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding favor, whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, I believe in America. America has made my fortune, and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and theyre the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we dont get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now. Its not personal, Sonny. Its strictly business. And most famously of all: Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse. The films title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brandos performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Dons subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the films plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brandos by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michaels centrality is signaled by the Dons frantic call, Wheres Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael! A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leaders head, he relates, and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. Thats my family Kay. Its not me. Michaels initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as Senator Corleone or Governor Corleone not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michaels coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten-year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the films art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the films mise en scene. Moreover, the films lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (prince of darkness) Willis, contributes greatly to both the films realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes  especially in the Dons home office  with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the films last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michaels participation in the baptism of sister Connies child. Likewise, The Godfathers soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas) and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that crime did not pay. Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generations-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos.	10
gangster	United States	opularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a godfather or don, the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family business. A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible.	10
A must watch especially with directors commentary	United States	Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world youve entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you dont find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know youre dealing with greatness.From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies Im sure youll experience the same.	10
Mind blowing drama, a must see	wow	Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzos The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). Its the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesnt (or, at least, shouldnt) pay.It still doesnt, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family arent limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzos point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narratives point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacksthey are animals anyway.This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. Its not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of lifemarriages, baptisms, family feastsbecome an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. Its nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.	10
A true masterpiece	United States	What can i say about The Godfather that hasnt already been said, this film is a masterpiece it is a cinematic landmark, it is in my opinion, better than Goodfellas, Goodfellas is great but this is such a more dramatic film. I love the beginning of this film when the undertaker is asking Vito Corleone for justice, it was such a beautifully shot scene i loved how Marlon Brando portrayed Vito it is one of if not his best performance (Apocalypse Now is his second) of his career. Te Godfather is in my top 10 films of all time and it will always will be no other film can change that. The Godfather will always be remembered as the greatest film of all time and will never be forgotten, i just love this film so much it actually was one of the inspirations that made me want to become a film director and Im only 14, it made me actually made me appreciate film and i am glad i watched this even its sequel was amazing and is in my top 20 favorite films of all time but 3 was terrible it should have never had ever been made and i will stick by that as long as i live but i love Francis Ford Coppolas direction of the film it will never be forgotten.	10
A masterpiece	Kragujevac	Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself with The Godfather, probably the greatest movie in cinema history. Marlon Brando shows us his magnificent skills and his way of dominating the scene. The Dons relationship with his family is unique and incredibly well depicted. Looking at Brandos career, which is frighteningly impressive, to say the least, the role of Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt his best one. To say that Al Pacino was incredible in this movie and the rest of the trilogy would be an understatement. James Caan, in the role of Sonny, comes right after Brando and Pacinos stunning performances. Truly a masterpiece, The first part of this epic trilogy will forever be at the very top of my list.	10
This Movie is an Offer you Cant Refuse	None	Incredible!! With the epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and directing this movie has to be considered THE best of all time. Although it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this movie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from the inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and care about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDbs 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable. Nobody couldve known that Marlon Brando, with two cotton balls, would create the most famous voice in cinematic history.	10
A tour de force of cinema	Malaysia	Since I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the time, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that is, until watched it two years ago.How to tell if a movie is good? If you cant stop thinking about it, if you keep replaying the characters lines in your sleep, then the movie isnt just good, its great. The Godfathers impact on the movie industry is incalculable, in almost ever modern gangster movie there is at least one reference to it.I can find no flaw in this movie. If there were anything such as a perfect movie, this is it. Coppola provides excellent direction such that though the movie stretches to almost three hours, you wont be bored for one minute. The highlight of this film is an innovation. The gangsters here are not portrayed as mindless monsters but as men with families. We see Vito and Michael Corleone as protagonists rather than antagonists. Credit for this goes to Mario Puzos original source material but let us not forget the actors.Marlon Brando gives the greatest performance of not only his career but of any other actor as the family patriarch. Hes so Don-like that you just wished you could go to him with all your problems too. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone. But he doesnt give a single performance, he gives two. At the beginning, he plays a war hero who doesnt want anything to do with the family business. Pacino skillfully shows us Michaels transition from this to a cold blooded Don at the end. The other actors play their parts well too. In fact, there has never been any other better cast than the cast of The Godfather.A cinematic masterpiece, this is one for the ages.	10
in short awesome.....	None	Instead of focusing on everything that is extraordinary about The Adoptive parent, a much simpler path for me to judge its quality is on what is awful about it. Each film has something that I dont care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldnt change anything about The Back up parent. There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadnt seen it prior. The acting from everybody included is extraordinary, Marlon Brando runs over superbly as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are astounding as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely essential, bringing back memories of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be fabulous for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, its a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic. The film is really stunning in the way every demise happens momentarily, and as it compasses ten years such a variety of distinctive things happen and each moment of it is extraordinary stimulation. Its a well- made and enthralling film that is just the first piece of a set of three, yet it remains all alone as a superb film in its own particular right. On the off chance that you havent seen it, what are you holding up for? This was one acclaimed film that didnt baffle.	8
Watch it twice!	California, United States	I wasnt too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them.The violence is brutal, the script is superb, and the soundtrack is incredible. Everyone involved should be proud at what they accomplished. I never read the book but fans say its a faithful adaptation. Goodfellas is a mobster film I like slightly more but The Godfather is still a cinematic achievement. I know some people are going to get on my case for not calling it the best movie ever made in the history of mankind, but Im not denying that its a good movie.Just watch it more than once to enjoy it for what it is and youll love it like I did!	8
A Must-See For All Generations	Greece	The Godfather has been a title so beloved and entirely embraced as a significant, cultural phenomenon, that in a certain level demands of you to watch it with full recommendations off of it. Especially if youre young, there is absolutely no way that the buzz of the greatest movie in history did not get you. So, even though that buzz doesnt necessarily ruin the viewing for you all-together, I will accept that while I was watching, I was unintentionally trying to like it and feel it.The beginning of the film sets the mood perfectly. There are no attachments to settled humor or dry dialogue. It warns us that this is going to be a serious take, on some pretty serious issues. Don Corleones first lines are self-aware and carefully put. This dominating appearance shows us a man trusted, beloved and respected and at the same time feared, depressed and deserted. And that goes for both his family and outsiders. He is a mafia man, one of the greatest, and his life is surrounded by his business partners, by his associates and comrades in this dark lifestyle. And throughout the entire movie, he is presented to have balanced the time between family and business, yet that seems like one impossible task. Micheal Corleone, son of the Godfather, is introduced like a man with a very different approach and very different opinions on the case of life and choices than the rest of his family and especially his father. That happens for two reasons: early on his life he decided not to be like him (even though he seems to be the one attached by the Godfather as the favorite) and he has chosen a decent life for him and Kay, the love of his life. Then, everything goes down the drain: someone attempts to kill the Godfather. It is at that point when the son Micheal starts his decay... No promises, no commitments, no wrongs... Someone tried to kill his loving father. He stares at every single person in his family just standing by, so in his rage, decides to do the unthinkable. Using his status as the most innocent of the Corleone family, he exacts revenge.When he succeeds, he exiles himself out of the country until things can settle down. He attempts to start a new life away from the madness with Apollonia, a beautiful woman he meets and falls in love with (although never convincing even himself that he has forgotten Kay). He comes to know the hard way that he cant run away from what he has done and what his family stands for. Someone tries to kill him even so far from his home but gets to Apollonia. So upon his return, he accepts the position of the new Godfather and immediately seems to be a changed man.Micheal retrieves Kay, makes unconditional promises and ends up being the very person he was trying to avoid.There are several things in this film that make it astounding. Relationships within the family are displayed in such a truthful way. Francis Ford Coppola offers us a chance to connect with many different characters and their several views. The main plot is driven excellently, with Don Corleone and Micheal taking the grandeur, but in the meanwhile we get to know the deep motions and powers of every person slightly connected to this world. What we get is a fiery and passionate film exploring deep meanings and strong notions. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for what was an unbelievably great performance. After this film, I totally get his worldwide fame as one of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino shines with charisma (which he perfected on the second part) in the greatest role of his career. And besides these two super-actors, is there anyone from the cast that I can talk badly for? All great.I guess the only issue with this movie is its running-time and most importantly the somewhat complicated way things glue together. I understand that Mario Puzo had a difficult task of bringing the book on- screen, but its the way we are drawn to these characters that makes me confused about who is who. And that is the reason I suggest we stick to the father-son relationship and not worry about certain aspects and scenes we dont understand or just keep asking who is that guy talking?This is the Godfather that everyone is talking about for decades, and if you dont like what you hear in the very first scene in that dark room, I warn you... turn of the picture and dont watch anymore. Come back a few years later when you could probably handle it.On the other hand, you must ask yourself: can you feel the zest for respect and loyalty when Don Corleone whispers his lines? Dont you yearn for the moral and innocent Micheal as the movie goes? Can you sympathize with Kay when the door closes at the end? Then The Godfather got you where it should have.	8
Geeky Randys summary	United States	Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzos best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his fathers footsteps. Pacinos transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that its worth every second of the films epic length, while Brandos iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinemas greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.**** (out of four)	10
The best movie by far.	Sweden	So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleones face when I was a kid... Years later I decided its time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I cant say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you havent watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is its line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.	10
Reaction	United Kingdom	just outstanding the sense or morality even thought what they do is wrong, you get a sense of pride and respect. at the end you do start wanting to create the same level of respect and love with your own family as if it was the same. defiantly deserves the word legendary as it is a timeless classic and should be watched if you havent already.this movie should be watched closely and with patients to get into as i can come across so the viewers that are not use to this type of pace, storyline can get confusing sometimes if your bad with names, other than that there no issues the film is well known for a reason and allows for multiple deductions to made within it as you try to find out who did what.	10
Barzinis a pimp	Texas	..Barzinis a pimp. That is my favorite line in this movie...There are many more lines. Lines that everyone should watch. Because this movie is one of the best movies ever made, and certainly one of the best mob/crime movies. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, or anything else with Joe Pesci. You will like this movie just as much. The cinematic quality is fantastic. The dialogue and acting are very convincing and makes it feel like you are watching history, not just a movie. And speaking of history, talk about Marlon Brando. Good lord. The guy puts his existence on pause to breathe life into Don Vito Corleone as the Godfather. His roll is phenomenal. And thats 10 lines, go watch the movie	10
Hollywoods Finest	United Kingdom	The Godfather is in my opinion the second greatest movie of all time. The pacing is flawless, the acting is absolutely mesmerising and the story is the most simply complicated one ever. Brando and Pacino were a match made in heaven for their characters and no movie will ever reach the pinnacle like The Godfather did. Stunning brilliant.10/10 Acting10/10 Story10/10 Pacing10/10 Adaptation from novel10/10 Overall	10
Good	Baku	I like it. This is good film and 10/10. Thanks all! I watched all series of this film. The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfathers essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Branos Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legends greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever.	10
I remember when I saw this film for the first time...	Sarajevo BH	This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder.	8
A classic Godfather	United Kingdom	Plot Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally pursued when he refuses to Sully the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his fathers illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the familys honourThe Godfather packs more into one gangster film than some genres output over decades. It is a big film with big themes, has memorable characters and lines. Mario Puzo novel once again proves that hes the master of storytelling  and Francis Ford Coppola of thrillingly violent filmmaking. With its all star cast this should go straight to the head of the list of essential viewing. With a classic sequel also to view. You will rarely get it so good.Makes Bernard Mungeam 5 star films	10
He is a good godson.	United States	This film has spawned so many gangster clichs and parodies that its not even funny. Every time youve heard of people sleeping with da fishies or making an offer you cant refuse, itll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horses head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brandos mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...its all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag Ive felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)	8
John Cena is the Next Star in Hollywood.	None	Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history. The symbolism featured in the scene, such as the shiny body oil and the you cant see me hand gesture, is the best Ive ever seen. By far the best movie I have ever seen. Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history.

Over all	Atlanta, GA United States	This film is an example of a great director, quality actors, outstanding script writing/ screen play and an amazing film score. I love it!My favorite scene:Don Corleone: Why did you go to the police? Why didnt you come to me first? Bonasera: What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do. Don Corleone: What is that? Bonasera whispers his request in the Dons ear That I cannot do. Bonasera: I will give you anything you ask. Don Corleone: Weve known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help. I cant remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But lets be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And, uh, you were afraid to be in my debt. Bonasera: I didnt want to get into trouble.Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. And you didnt need a friend like me. But, uh, now you come to me, and you say: Don Corleone, give me justice. But you dont ask with respect. You dont offer friendship. You dont even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money.Bonasera: I ask for justice. Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive. Bonasera: Let them suffer then, as she suffers. How much shall I pay you? Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If youd come to me in friendship, then this scum that wounded your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you. Bonasera: Be my friend  Godfather. Bonasera bows toward the Don and kisses the Dons hand Don Corleone: Good. Someday, and that day may never come, Ill call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day  accept this justice as a gift on my daughters wedding day.Bonasera: Grazie, Godfather. Don Corleone: Prego. Give this to, uh, Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who arent going to be carried away. After all, were not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker thinks. The Godfather	10

Legendary Movie	Dubai	This type of movies which you get to watch over and over again without getting bored of it, they way it has been scripted, acted, produced and directed is really attractive and amazingly catching your breath, it has a lot of life lessons to learn from no matter what do you do in your life, it also shows the importance of family bonding and keeping it all balanced. Im convinced that I will never ever get to watch a similar movie to this one with this brilliance in every aspect, I dont even believe that if there would be anyone on this earth who has never saw the Godfather Trilogy, it is absolutely highly recommended, but of course its not suitable for the little kids, it has lots of violent scenes, hopefully well get to see more and more of these awesome titles.	10
The Best movie ever	portugal	The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art. As filmmaking and storytelling, The Godfather remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons.	10
The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time.	Romania	The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppolas brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacinos acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world thats why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie.	6
Such a freaking classic.	good review	Don Vito Corleone: You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?. The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends dont know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars thats how good to movie is.	10
Look how they massacred my boy	None	The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penns Bonnie  Clyde) to the premiere of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia order.	10
a film depicting the little Italy in NY	China	People always say America is a big melting pot, but actually it is not actually like that. America is separated by different communities,the WASP, the catholics, Jewish people, the Asian, and the black people.Italian immigrants belong to the catholics,but they are looked down upon by some other European immigrants,so they have to ask help from their godfather, the mafia. This film is really impressive.Don Coleone is really a good father, his elder son has a bad temper, his second son is weak, his younger son is intelligent ans unique.This is a big family,this family culture is deeply rooted in their brains.This film is a mirror of Italy society:Power, Women and Money. There is a lot of media reports about Italy PM ex-PM Belusconi, why this corrupt PM not sacked even he faces lots of charges? People always say America dream, but the reality is cruel. If you want to make fortune, you must have support from your relations even the mafia.The wealth is controlled by a few people, they make their money through their relations become richer.This is Capitalism.	6
Great movie but extremely overrated	United States	The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and thats fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesnt give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you dont doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brandos performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. Its such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow.	7
The Godfather (1972)	Greece	Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzos The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). Its the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesnt (or, at least, shouldnt) pay.It still doesnt, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family arent limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzos point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narratives point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacksthey are animals anyway.This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. Its not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of lifemarriages, baptisms, family feastsbecome an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. Its nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes.	10
The Greatest Cast For A Movie Ever.	United Kingdom	Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. The Godfather is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughters Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horses head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldnt have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say Falls from grace is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich Sepia toned movie.Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. The Godfather, has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brandos or Pachinos? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the Love theme all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppolas efforts.Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: Probably the finest cast ever assembled. 10/10.	10
The Geatest Movie Ever Made	Canada	You cant really criticize a film like The Godfather, especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has been highly praised by fans universally. Its extremely hard for a person who has never seen The Godfather without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobsters depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughters wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. Its not revenge, as long as your daughters still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a Moustache Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, its just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and its up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzos book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. The Godfather is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacinos Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michaels transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book its handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. Its also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But thats good for the novels sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words required viewings.	10
Very Average Film. Very Overrated	United Kingdom	Marlon Brandos acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. Its just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still havent seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.	7
Filming of Horses Head Scene	United States	I was present when the filming of the Horses head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horses head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Dons relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50 of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a rookie to the making of The Godfather. Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the Gold Coast of Long Island. One was the new version of Sabrina, starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks...	10
Im finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was	United Kingdom	There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films Ive seen, so much so I couldnt think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didnt see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horses head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacinos casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox	10
For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.	United States	Lately it seems, The Godfather has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I dont see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason Ive never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during its theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. Theres a good reason why. I dont think theres ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the sleeps with the fishes calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasnt Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! Quite simply, The Godfather is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931s Little Caesar and Public Enemy. For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that its impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of its supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.There has been enough written about the film that I dont need to get into the story itself. Ill content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonnys job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michaels restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagens ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devils work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that cant be refused. With The Godfather, it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of its parts. So Ill content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. For cinema fans, The Godfather is all cannoli.	10
A beautiful film	United Kingdom	I have not watched this film since the 70s. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife Why cant you two just enjoy a film without checking if its good or not on that website you go on? I put off watching it with him for ages because its about 3 hours long and Im prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we wont do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and its just business. The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like Im going to blow you away motherf*cker It just makes you an offer that you cant refuse.	10
Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse	Germany	Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this line of business to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but The Godfather manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the good boy of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.Francis Ford Coppolas film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and dont lay you to rest.The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes)  thats absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor.	10
not the godfather of all movies	Ringmer (East sussex), England	As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time.	9
A flawless masterpiece	Peru	So, those of you who havent seen it may wonder, Whats so good about the Godfather? Why is it that this, out of every movie ever made, is considered by so many people to be one of the if not the all-time best? Allow me to explain as best I can. Its the kind of movie where everything is perfect. Everything. The acting, the script, the pacing, the cinematography, right down to the soundtrack. All of it.Oh, sure, its a leisurely movie. It clocks in at just under three hours, and the plot takes a while to unfold. But it is NOT slow or boring. While not a suspense film in the traditional sense, the movie is definitely suspenseful, and I have to applaud Coppola for his excellent use of tension building. In other words, he uses the three-hour length of the film perfectly: theres not a wasted minute among these 175, not a single bit Id take out.And besides, the acting is great. Just awesome. Brandos performance is stunning; the guy just oozes cool, as he always does. Hes magnetic as Vito Corleone, arguably his most famous role ever. And, of course, Al Pacinos Michael Corleone deserves nothing but the highest of praise. It was the guys big break, and he does a fantastic job displaying Michaels ruthless, cunning, coldly intelligent rise to power. The two of them pretty much make the movie, but even people playing bit parts give their all, resulting in a movie that makes mobsters seem very human. Special shout-out to Robert Duvall for his excellent turn as Tom Badass Hagen, and Diane Keaton (one of my favorite actresses, Ill add) as Michaels girlfriend and moral compass Kay. Having been mostly familiar with her for her roles in those classic Woody Allen movies, I had no idea she could carry a dramatic role, but she does an excellent job. And the script is just awesome, including a couple classic lines.Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. And, of course, He made him an offer he couldnt refuse. A whole ton of memorable ones. Actually, pretty much every line in this movie is quotable, and given its three-hour length, thats pretty impressive. And that theme song... oh man. One of the best ever written.A note also must be made on the baptism scene. All aspiring filmmakers should watch this movie for a lot of reasons, but for that scene in particular. The building of tension, the symbolism, the sacred-profane juxtaposition, the heart-stopping climax... perfect. The scene encapsulates everything I love about the movie into just a few minutes.And thats the Godfather for you. Its bleak, tender, touching, violent, thoughtful, occasionally horrifying (the famed horse head scene, anyone?), and sometimes even darkly funny. Its a complete masterpiece in every sense of the word. This, and its sequel for that matter, is a movie for the ages. Basically, if its directed by Francis Ford Coppola and its got Robert Duvall in it, youre in for a fantastic movie. Thats a good rule of thumb. And the book its based on is just as good!	10
Good, Maybe Great, Not The Best Movie Ever	None	Like I said: Definitely not the best movie ever. While the movie had its good points, I can't see why it's number 1 on IMDB. I don't even think it was better than Goodfellas, or even better than the other two movies I rented (American History X, Casablanca). Oh well, still good entertainment, looking forward to Godfather Part II.	7
A work of art.	Co Down, Northern Ireland	Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.	8
An interminable, shoddily-researched lecture masquerading as comedy	Lincoln, NE	For those of us who have watched Kirk Cameron pontificate on the wonders of the banana, or read his musings on the legitimacy of the existence of fire-breathing dragons, we know that Kirk Cameron himself is comedy gold. One might expect more hilarity from Cameron in Saving Christmas, but Cameron actually intentionally tries to build a comedy here, and the result is an unfunny, unfocused, interminable mess.The film begins with an uncomfortable scene involving Kirk Cameron sitting in a chair, lecturing at the audience. &#x22;They don&#x27;t want us to love Christmas,&#x22; Cameron declares authoritatively, never bothering to define exactly who &#x22;they&#x22; are. Cameron drones on for several more minutes, and at this point in the film, I heard a kid in the back of the theater yawn loudly&#x97;perhaps an audible protest that this film would not be the exciting romp promised on the poster.Finally, the film cuts away from Kirk Cameron, and we see several characters enjoying a Christmas party. But then we see Kirk Cameron again, the film freezes, and we hear Kirk Cameron narrating about himself: &#x22;That&#x27;s me&#x97;Kirk!&#x22; More lecturing ensues.Eventually, a character by the name of Christian (almost as clever as &#x22;Josh Wheaton&#x22;), a Christian himself, despondently finds his way to a car, apparently disillusioned by the materialism of Christmas. Enter Kirk Cameron, who enters the vehicle and does what he does best&#x97;more lecturing.The majority of the film takes place in this car as Kirk lectures to Christian, with occasional cutaways to Biblical imagery. Cameron tries to make the case that Christmas traditions, such as celebratory trees and gifts, all somehow originated with Christianity, not paganism. (Never mind the fact that ancient paganism predates Christianity.) &#x22;Last time I checked, God created the winter solstice!&#x22; is the type of asinine reasoning you&#x27;ll hear from Kirk Cameron throughout the film. Cameron&#x27;s facts are both dubious and sparse, and his connections are spurious&#x97;but Christian is nevertheless invariably blown away by Kirk Cameron&#x27;s apparently amazing insight.Perhaps aware that interminable lecturing on its own would be unbearable for an audience, the film provides characters with quirky personalities in an effort to break up the tedium. In particular, we are treated to a scene back in the house of two characters rambling schizophrenically as they drink hot chocolate. It has nothing to do with Christian&#x27;s story, it makes the movie feel unfocused, it goes on for far too long, and if my theater is any indication, it is not funny at all. In fact, there was dead silence in my theater throughout the entire run of this &#x22;comedy&#x22; film.The film ends with a dance sequence that feels like it lasts ten minutes, as well as multiple, gratuitous blooper scenes&#x97;I suppose for no reason other than to pad the running time. Just when you think it&#x27;s finally over, we see Kirk Cameron again, and he continues to lecture the audience&#x97;this time about how materialism is just fine, because Jesus came to us in a material body, after all.One gets the impression that Kirk Cameron actually started reading his own Bible, was disturbed by what he found (such as Jesus&#x27; instruction to &#x22;go sell your possessions and give to the poor&#x22;), and produced this film as a desperate justification for his own hypocrisy.At my theater, nobody laughed, and nobody stayed for the end credits. This purported comedy film fails at every level. If you&#x27;re really looking for a laugh, go back and take a look at what Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort have to say about the glorious design of the banana.	1
A yuletide atrocity	United States	It&#x27;s no secret that, on both the mainstream and independent circuit of film, Christian cinema has been a big focus in 2014. Films like &#x22;Heaven is for Real,&#x22; &#x22;Noah,&#x22; &#x22;Son of God,&#x22; and next month&#x27;s &#x22;Exodus: Gods and Kings&#x22; have all catered to the faithful in some way and have gone on to achieve uniformly strong financial numbers as well. The independent circuit has seen big hits like &#x22;God&#x27;s Not Dead&#x22; and marginal successes like &#x22;Left Behind,&#x22; &#x22;Mom&#x27;s Night Out,&#x22; &#x22;Persecuted,&#x22; and &#x22;When the Game Stands Tall,&#x22; all of which finding ways to connect with their target audience in at least recognizing their faith in the cinema, a place where it&#x27;s fair to believe the religious demographic has felt ignored. Former Television star and devout, outspoken Christian Kirk Cameron has now thrown his hat in the ring, latching on to this newfound trend, and effectively making not only the worst film of its genre but the worst film of 2014. &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas&#x22; is a disjointed mess, structurally pathetic and morally bankrupt as we watch scenes interwoven with little coherency, dialog written and delivered in its most wooden form, and wonderful morals to teach our children, like &#x22;materialism is good.&#x22; The film begins with Cameron sitting in a blatantly artificial living room, decorated with more Christmas lights and flair than Macy&#x27;s after Thanksgiving passes, giving us an introduction to the film at hand. He states the biggest problem with the Christmas season is the &#x22;people&#x22; who want to segregate the spread of faith and good cheer to the private homes of those who celebrate the holiday or simply want the holiday done away with all together. He rambles on for about three minutes as the introduction sets the perfect theme for this film; it&#x27;s a circumventing project that never results in a specific or thoughtfully-articulated point.We cut to a Christmas party held by Cameron&#x27;s sister, where a Santa has been hired, the tree has been erected, the house has been decorated, a feast has been prepared, and everyone is in an incorruptibly cheery mood; everyone except Cameron&#x27;s brother-in-law Christian (director Darren Doane), who is seen moping around the house before quietly slipping away to his car. Kirk follows Christian and learns the materialism of Christmas bothers him immensely, as he watches kids beg for toys they won&#x27;t play with in three weeks and parents max out their credit cards, giving way to the materials and the illuminating tree in the center of the room, and all while neglecting the baby Jesus in the manger, who is the ultimate &#x22;reason for the season.&#x22;Cameron begins to initiate flashbacks to biblical times to &#x22;justify&#x22; why we have the Christmas traditions that we do. However, it&#x27;s not enough that we get a history lesson told from the enormously biased lens of Cameron, but in a dodgy and muddled manner. Cameron gets absorbed in the significance of baby Jesus&#x27;s swaddling cloth and the original mean-spirited roots of Saint Nicholas (something that will undoubtedly scare and confuse children), never addressing Christian&#x27;s true distaste for the holiday season. Kirk meanders for about forty minutes, talking himself in incoherent and redundant circles, never addressing Christian&#x27;s questions in a way that we can extract counterpoints or citing Christmas&#x27;s Pagan and cultist roots (if you&#x27;re going to show Saint Nicholas as a brute, at least address the backstory).Interjected in these ridiculously dry biblical flashbacks and in-car dialogs are exaggerated characters masquerading as likable people with personalities drawn so wide they are desperately unfunny. We see two party guests discuss &#x22;The War on Christmas,&#x22; relating it to several other conspiracy theories that just feels like a soundoff of paranoia. We get a few minutes of dead-end, annoying conversation and some of the worst displays of acting this year before it&#x27;s back to the car for a half-assed lecture. &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; ends with an abhorrent dance number to an incorrigible techno/rap hybrid, with members of the cast obnoxiously dancing and doing slow-motion choreography together. We end things with a perfunctory voice-over with Cameron before we&#x27;re greeted by almost ten minutes of closing credits showing bloopers, outtakes, and a barrage of other things padding this project to just barely being feature- length (eighty minutes). If my plot synopsis sounds like it has not made any sense, then I have effectively lived up to the structure and the narrative pace of this particular film.Just by comparing the full-length film to its trailer, you can tell &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; was Cameron&#x27;s last minute idea to cash in on the Christian cinema craze of the year. The trailer for the film talks about how Christmas has been corrupted by materialism and the political correctness of the holiday. However, Cameron blatantly contradicts his thesis when he states during the closing monologue that &#x22;materialism is good&#x22; because Christmas is about &#x22;God taking possession of a material body.&#x22; Aside from ushering in a pathetic excuse for a moral at the end of a film about Christmas, the cardinal sins committed here run amuck: a sloppy narrative hodgepodge of biblical flashbacks, inept lecturing, and pointless filler clearly padding a small runtime, atrocious acting on all fronts, a desperate attempt at &#x22;staying hip&#x22; and keeping the attention of the audience by throwing in a hip-hop dance number, contemptible morals, and failure to address or even stick to a cogent thesis. Kirk Cameron and company should be required to volunteer at local charities or help cater several breakfasts with Santa to make up for such a yuletide atrocity.	1
Kirk Camerons Low Budget Soapbox	United States	I created this account just to give this 1 star. That&#x27;s how bad it was. I went into this expecting a generic Christmas movie, and I didn&#x27;t even get that. The &#x22;plot&#x22; is awful. I put plot in quotation marks because I&#x27;m not even sure if this movie has one. Two guys walk out to a car and talk for an hour. That&#x27;s all that happens. It&#x27;s basically a feature length sermon, and a crappy one at that. There are literally NO redeeming qualities in this film. The camera work is extremely amateurish, and the acting and direction were absolutely abysmal. I had extremely low expectations for this, and it still managed to be disappointing. This movie is a total waste of time and money, and I honestly believe it&#x27;s the worst movie of 2014.	1
A horrifying cash grab	Australia	This movie is horrendous on so many levels - patronising to Christians, incredibly bad plot and direction, the acting and dialogue is as comfortable as a dentist&#x27;s visit. I suspect the whole thing is purely a desperate attempt by Cameron to pander to under-educated Christians in an effort to earn their hard earned dollars. Either that, or it is just a giant ego trip for him. I had no preconceptions before I went to watch this, and left confused as to the amount of utter garbage wedged into what seemed like an eternity of boredom. Even worse, he is asking his Christian supporters to bear false witness by skewing the votes here and on rotten tomatoes. Hypocritical? I&#x27;ll let you decide.	1
This movie is why a 0 star rating should be implemented on this site	None	Saving Christmas needed saving...and by that, I mean it should have been mercy killed. the acting is horrendous and it&#x27;s story is only a reminder that anyone that paid to see it wasted their money. Even if you are a die-hard Christian, please do not see this movie, it&#x27;s one of the worst movies you could ever watch ever, and considering stuff like The Room and Birdemic exists, That&#x27;s saying A lot. oh, and that thing Kirk Cameron&#x27;s doing to try to boost the rating on Rotten Tomatoes: Cameron, you should know the Bible verse &#x22;Thou shalt not bear false witness&#x22; it&#x27;s one of the 10 commandments. That&#x27;s all I have to say on this matter, Don&#x27;t watch the film. I mean Seriously Cameron, you should know better.	1
Not remotely funny, neither in the right nor wrong sense	Germany	I have to admit, that I hadn&#x27;t even planed to go to the movies on the day that I walked into &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22;. There was nothing on offer that interested me, so I turned to figure another way to squander my money. But then I saw the name &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x22;, saw that pasty face on the poster and two words came to my mind: &#x22;Crockoduck&#x22; and &#x22;Banana&#x22;! Yes, through the internet-memes and jokes I had been exposed to Cameron and his ilk. Upon realizing that those people were not comedians, I figured this was the most hilarious insane stuff I had heard in a long time and that Kirk Cameron may well be the missing brother of &#x22;Dumb and Dumber&#x22;. So I flashed the buck, walked in and expected much unintentional hilarity and future memes in the making.There were about 10 to 15 people sitting in the cinema, most with kids (I presume they were expecting a Christmas comedy). For a good deal of the beginning we are exposed to Cameron brattling on about some things or other, but it was mainly boring, nonsensical stuff that contained no (unintentional) comedy gold. Only when Kirk spouts that &#x22;god created winter solstice&#x22;, there was some chuckling to be heard. Not bad, but heard before (what hasn&#x27;t god created allegedly? Cars, air, shoes, bacteria, the universe and everything else, etc &#x96; this answer will give you a guaranteed A+ in any bible- or koran-school). At this point Cameron is sitting in some car with another guy and, like a true believer he keeps rambling and rambling and rambling. Nodded off for awhile but since I have a light sleep and get easily awoken by noise, I can only deduct that there was no joke missed since nobody had been laughing so far. At what I presume must have been the end of the &#x22;movie&#x22; there was some ridiculous dance-sequence (you know the type that should signify to the audience that they&#x27;re watching a &#x27;hip&#x27; film) and I decided to call it a day. As I turned to leave, I noticed that the cinema was empty and that I was the last rat to leave the sinking ship. So I left Kirk and his friends to dance to an empty cinema &#x96; and for all I know, they still dance there as I write.Look, we are all aware that people will believe much if only it gives them a crutch for reality. Virgins giving birth, horses flying from Mekka to Jerusalem overnight, zombies rising from the grave in order to bring world-peace, etc. It would be pointless (and perhaps even unkind) to point out that virgins cannot give birth, horses don&#x27;t fly and that the dead stay dead. But that&#x27;s were magic and science clash, alchemy has to make way or chemistry and believe hollers at common-sense and knowledge. Nothing new there, it&#x27;s been going on since the stone-age. But the stuff that Cameron and his ilk have formulated here (to put it kindly), that&#x27;s a whole new dimension of crazy. It reeks not only of fanatics but of self-serving. And the worst sin: this movie is boring, tedious and free of laughs, no matter which way you slice it.The lesson learned: it can be mildly amusing to watch a five minute YouTube video about a deranged guy, but giving him 80 minutes of your live, that&#x27;s simply not a good idea. It&#x27;s like holding a &#x27;deep&#x27; conversation with a bunch of jehova&#x27;s witness or the guy on the corner with the &#x22;the end is nigh&#x22;-sign &#x96; what&#x27;s the point if no real laughs are to be had? Just wait for the internet-meme; if there&#x27;s something worth laughing about, the &#x22;haters&#x22; will find and post if for sure (and it&#x27;s free!). &#x22;Jesus Camp&#x22; was funnier (and &#x22;Jesus Camp&#x22; was actually a very sad movie). This here is &#x22;IMDB Bottom-100&#x22;-material.Now, enough electronic ink wasted on this. Let&#x27;s make space for those who found the movie &#x22;exceptional&#x22;, &#x22;inspirational&#x22; and &#x22;great education&#x22; &#x96; you might be able to guess from which corner those come.What I give this tripe? Of course nothing. If you see a one point rating, it probably comes from god (pardon, meant to say IMDb)	1
Kirk Cameron isnt saving Christmas hes desecrating it	None	What&#x27;s wrong with this movie? There&#x27;s not enough time or space to cover all of it, so I&#x27;ll just share the main reasons why anyone who loves Jesus, His Word and His people should or would never watch this mockery of Christmas.&#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; is in direct violation of Romans 14:5-6 and 22-23, twists Scripture, reconstructs history and encourages gluttony.There&#x27;s nothing in this film that is &#x22;wholesome&#x22; and good for anyone, believer or non-believer.Let&#x27;s save others from Kirk and crew&#x27;s version of Christ&#x27;s first coming and celebrate (if your conscience allows) with reverence, awestruck wonder and with the true and great joy that envelopes all who are humbled by and grateful for God&#x27;s most amazing Gift--Jesus Christ, the one and only Son of God.http://www.sunnyshell.org/2014/10/kirk-camerons-saving-christmas.html	1
Notice how long the 10-star raters have been members, and how many movies theyve reviewed...	Pittsburgh, PA	First, let me state that in spite of the claims of Cameron and those who support him (and who have attempted to artificially raise this movie&#x27;s ratings with fake profiles and fake reviews), I, as someone who hated this movie, have nothing against Christians or Christianity. Not at all. Most everyone I know and love _are_ Christians. Die-hard, conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Fox-news-loving fundamentalist Christians. And even THEY thought this movie sucked.That Kirk tried to use religious guilt on people to have the ratings artificially inflated is just pathetic. Seriously, dude, you have a problem. You need help. Get some. :-/ My opinion of this movie is pretty much the same as the opinions of EVERYONE I know who&#x27;s actually had the misfortune of deciding to give it a try. It would be pure camp if those who made it weren&#x27;t being so stone-faced serious. It&#x27;s patronizing, condescending, childish and just downright _bad_. And it&#x27;s not the message, itself - even those I know who agree with the central point Kirk&#x27;s trying to make see the movie as doing more harm than good.As for that illicit ratings-inflating campaign, it appears to be bearing fruit. When you have a movie with overwhelmingly bad ratings (and I man REALLY bad, where most are just 1-star with, shall we say, &#x22;Nothing nice to say...&#x22;), and just a couple of profiles with 10-star ratings and glowing things to say, and ALL of those 10-star profiles were clearly just set up just to make the glowing review about just that one movie... I&#x27;m not going to outright accuse anyone of anything, but, well, it doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in their legitimacy.I mean seriously, dude, stop it. You&#x27;re not helping Christianity&#x27;s image at all. In fact, you&#x27;re making it worse. Even if you don&#x27;t care about your own image, you should seriously give thought to how much more damage you want to do to the Christian image in the U.S. today. Or are you a closet atheist trying to destroy the &#x22;enemy&#x22; from within? Your actions are hurting far more than helping.And I have nothing against Christianity or religion in general. If people want to be proud of their religion and remind themselves of the spin Christianity has added to the meaning of all these previously-existing traditions and holidays, that&#x27;s wonderful. But this? This isn&#x27;t _that_. This is just pandering, patronizing, exploiting - pure and simple.Please, Kirk, get help.	1
How to Watch Saving Christmas	New York City	Every so often, a movie comes along that reminds us why drinking games were invented. This is that movie.Three margaritas seems to be the minimum for watching this one. With that much tequila in you, you will be able to appreciate the subtle humor and profound wisdom of Kirk Camer...hmph....hmph....hmph....BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. I thought I could type that with a straight face. I couldn&#x27;t. Must be the margaritas.At any rate, this is a laughably bad movie that should go a long way toward torpedoing Mr. Cameron&#x27;s already sinking career. And I say, fire at will!	1
Not feature-length quality	United States	Full disclosure: I am a Roman Catholic, raised by devout parents and taught by dedicated clergy. I happen to subscribe to the view that the &#x22;war on Christmas&#x22; is part of a larger, not necessarily connected, movement whose chief side effect is to eliminate or diminish the chief underpinnings and foundations of western Judeo-Christian society. Lawsuits against Nativity displays are, to me, the handiwork of unhappy zealots. Having said all that, this film was earnest but profoundly flawed.First, I didn&#x27;t appreciate the swipe against the Catholic Church&#x27;s hierarchy (bishops with high hats and scepters) during the St. Nicholas segment. I do like the St. Nicholas story, but it was contrived here with the original St. Nicholas doing a &#x22;ho-ho-ho&#x22; (I am not kidding) just before being told by his assistant to start the deliveries (presumably of gifts).Second, if indeed the simplicity of the original Nativity is to be stressed, with Jesus born to Mary and Joseph in a cave, laid in a feeding manger, then perhaps they should have cast a Mary who had not just had her nails done. There they were, as Mary was holding the Christ child, each nail impeccable - and painted. And their garments? Perfectly clean, even looking like they&#x27;d just been ironed. Third, don&#x27;t direct so that we can see the direction. Head turns, puzzled looks, earnest looks . . . I shouldn&#x27;t be hearing in my head the director&#x27;s exact stage directions. &#x22;OK, look right at him then turn away.&#x22; Fourth, this was not about Saving Christmas. This was about explaining our modern celebration of it - it&#x27;s already been saved, judging from the frequent references to it being celebrated the world over. I liked Noah. I liked Narnia. I like the Hobbit movies. I did not like this one.	1
More Plot in this review than in the movie	United States	Kirk plays Kirk. Bridgette plays Bridgette. That is about how inventive this movie is. Darren plays Christian, because the audience isn&#x27;t expected to understand that he is a typical Christian without this clue. Given that, Kirk should have been named CluelessLecturer.I didn&#x27;t stay long enough to see if the Titanic sunk, or if there was a surprise ending.As I watched this movie I realized that I would likely never again have to modify my &#x22;worst movie ever made&#x22; and for that, I thank you Kirk.GOOD POINTS: 1) no other movie through 2020 will have to worry about being Worst Movie of the Decade 2) we don&#x27;t make movies on &#x22;film&#x22; any more, so this is not a waste of film--- just a waste of digital 1s and 0s 3) i had more time to concentrate on my popcorn 4) i used my phone in the theater during the movie, and nobody seemed to think it was a bad thingKirk, it rained in California this week---- I think God saw your movie and was crying.	1
Did more to destroy Christmas than save it.	United States	&#x22;Jesus became Material... so that is why materialism is OK&#x22; - is pretty much the summary of the movie. There are some Christians who do not participate in Christmas for many reasons. Kirk apparently wanted to respond to this crowd by producing this low budget, effortless film. Not only does he do his best to destroy any solid logic for celebrating Christmas, he paints fellow (non Christmas observing) believers as grumpy, ignorant, radical, and stupid. Thus, giving mainstream Christianity a horrible image. Essential Kirk has brought Christian evangelism 2 steps back in reaching the world with the true message of salvation and replaced it with justification, poor logic, and and a refocus of the faith, not of Christ, but on emotion.Kirk attempted to encourage Christians with logic and reasoning to defend the mainstream stance of Christmas.... he failed. I left this film wanting more to NOT celebrate Christmas than I did celebrate it. Horrible film, waste of money, and waste of time. An E for Effort would not even be suitable to merit this film... No effort was placed in it.	1
Spoiler Alert...  It was awful!	United States	OK, So, after seeing this film, I don&#x27;t care what Kirk Cameron thinks about anything, and I surely never want to see (much less pay to see) anymore of his attempts at &#x22;Religious Entertainment&#x22;. They say that &#x22;no one starts out to make a bad film&#x22;. I think Kirk is the exception. I thought that this MIGHT be a &#x22;feel good&#x22; Christian film, it wasn&#x27;t. It was a lot of Cameron, not really even acting, just going on and on about how no one thought enough about Christ at Christmas. The fact that he distorted history about Christmas was also something that really added to the &#x22;holier than thou&#x22; factor of this film. And the fact that he totally ignores any other faith, that celebrate similar winter holidays adds to the arrogance of this film. It basically says, &#x22;If you don&#x27;t do everything that I do, you&#x27;re going to Hell.&#x22; Okay... Here&#x27;s the thing, Kirk Cameron can be a film maker. He can be an Actor. He can be a Preacher. But this film proves that he shouldn&#x27;t think that he can combine all three! He just comes across as pompous.	1
Must Not See	United States	This is the worst holiday movie ever made. Don&#x27;t go see this movie, don&#x27;t buy it. forget it happened, i try so hard every day to forget i wasted my life watching this. instead of viewing this movie, turn of your TV and spend time with your family. Get to know them better instead of watching 2 guys talk in a car for 20 minuets. just dot go,just dot go. just dot go ,just dot go . just dot go ,just dot go. why would anyone want to sit and watch this. go watch Rosewater way better film.what every you do don&#x27;t go and see this crappy film. you will hate it i hated it. Had &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; run any longer, i wold of died.	1
Another terrible movie from Kirk Cameron	None	This movie was a joke. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. It&#x27;s a typical pandering movie that will no doubt be forgotten. Cameron claims that Christmas has become too materialistic, yet in a recent article claimed he was a &#x27;sucker&#x27; for all things Christmas. The decorations, the gifts, the trees (which are Pagan by the way), and the shopping. He stated in an article he was a sucker for these things. Pretty much in contrary to his movie. He even once claimed Halloween was stolen by the Pagans from Christians. Kirk Cameron is quite clueless. Even Christmas is Pagan. He&#x27;s a joke and so are his movies. His movies are made just to line his pockets. He And he&#x27;s a bigot to boot.	1
Jesus Clearly Hates Kirk Cameron	United States	In this movie, Kirk Cameron shows us that the best way to get get the world to hate you is to judge and hate people who are different from you. Like Kirk Cameron, the key is to make sure you let everyone know that your judgmental and hateful behavior comes from Jesus and the Bible. Kirk doesn&#x27;t judge and hate because that&#x27;s who he is as a person. No. That is not why. Kirk judges and hates other people because the Bible and Jesus told him that he could behave that way. Where has the old Kirk Cameron of old gone? We all want to know. What made you so cray cray? Why are you so angry at the gays? Why do you hate other religions so much? Why did you ruin your sister, Candace, with your terrible ideas and nutso religious rantings? Oh, dearest Kirk, Bless Your Heart.	1
Worst movie ever. Directed by a disgusting human.	None	The loser Kirk Cameron actually tried to falsify the rating for this movie here and on Rotten Tomatoes.Someone should tell him that lying and cheating are not acceptable Christian values.Someone should also tell him that he&#x27;s celebrating a Pagan holiday. These things he decided are what makes Christmas what it is are the commercialized things that don&#x27;t actually have anything to do with Christmas. It&#x27;s like the guy owns stock in Christmas supplies. If you claim you like this movie, you are a liar. Since lying is a Christian no-no, you&#x27;re going to Hell. Enjoy.Not everyone should be allowed to make movies, especially when they have a political or religious agenda.God likes an honest Atheist more than a lying Christian.	1
Kirk Cameron doesnt speak for all of us	United States	I barely survived the trailer. I have no idea how people paid money to see this movie. As a Christian, I have to beg Christian filmmakers to stop preaching to the converted by writing atheists and agnostics as idiotic, hateful, anti-Christian monsters. Your persecution complex in a country comprised almost entirely of Christians is laughable and only further isolates you from those you hope to convert.Kirk Cameron could have made a movie that&#x27;s actually about family and the true meaning of Christmas. Instead, he wanted to create a polemic against the people he&#x27;s imagined that are trying to prevent him from calling it Christmas. It&#x27;s just sad. Please stop making these terrible films. You&#x27;re embarrassing all of us.	1
Wow	United States	After watching this movie, I may have to gouge my eyeballs out of my head in an attempt to erase the inane images seared into my retinas. Alas, it won&#x27;t help. Why can&#x27;t I give this a zero score? A score of 1 is infinitely higher than zero, and it frankly doesn&#x27;t deserve a 1. A more redeeming film could have been made simply by filming a humpback whale attempting to mate with a Russian submarine, or perhaps watching howler monkeys preen and consume the gnats out of each other&#x27;s hairy backs. But no . . . I was instead subjected to this sermon pontificating about how society has distorted the true meaning of Christmas (well, duh!) but yet after watching this, I found the thought of selfish consumerism to be rather uplifting. Now that is a Christmas miracle!	1
Cameron isnt so much saving Christmas as hes saving the economy for his pay masters	Seattle, WA	Ultimately if Christmas returned to its more simple religious roots (&#x22;reason for the season&#x22;), the vast economic pump that enriches, oh, Koch Industries and everyone else who keeps the religious right in power would be gone and they would, gasp, lose vast sums of money. Even if Christmas became more of an Easter level of commercialism, the effects on the economy would be ruinous. One wonders why Cameron has made such a film when most Christians scream about the commercialism (which technically is keeping most of them in jobs). I suppose Cameron isn&#x27;t so much saving Christmas as he&#x27;s saving the economy for his pay masters.	1
Abhorrent in every way	Silver Spring, Maryland	Every Christmas season one can count on the fact that we will be inundated with TV shows recycling the It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life story, Hallmark Channel will overwhelm us with treacle, and a spate of Christmas-themed films will multiply at the cineplex to raise holiday spirits. I give extremist Christian Kirk Cameron dubious credit for crafting a Christmas-themed film that actually seems to be completely clueless about the meaning of Christmas.It goes without saying that the film resembles a glorified home movie, with horrible writing, worse acting and horrendous production values. Most of the film functions as little more than an unwieldy frame for Cameron to lecture at the audience using the most spurious of &#x22;facts&#x22; and a dubious re-writing of history.The basic &#x22;story&#x22; opens at a family Christmas party where Kirk&#x27;s brother-in-law, Christian (oh the irony!) is all rather overwhelmed and depressed by the materialism of the holiday and feels that the true meaning of Christmas has been lost. This &#x22;attitude&#x22; apparently irritates everyone else, and so Kirk follows Christian to his car to harangue him on his misguided foolishness for the extraordinarily padded 80 minutes running time. Most of this has the camera focused on Cameron&#x27;s perpetually smug smirk while he relentlessly lectures his hapless brother-in-law with outright lies, heavily abridged stories, and general all-around shaming. Interspersed to pad the running time, we take some brief breaks back into the house where completely ridiculous one-note flamboyant caricatures indulge in laughable conversations that no one you know not in a padded cell will ever have with you in your lifetime. The pathetic point though is that during Cameron&#x27;s often incoherent and misleading ramblings, he never once truly addresses any of the issues that Christian had about the materialism of the modern celebrations. Nevertheless, Kirk&#x27;s relentless verbal diarrhea utterly astounds Christian and makes him &#x22;see the light&#x22; and he returns to the party to beg the forgiveness of everyone there for negatively impacting their celebration.Then, Kirk launches into yet another lecture where he urges us to buy the biggest tree, get the richest butter, and max out the credit cards because this is all a part of Christmas and don&#x27;t let anyone tell you otherwise. I myself was raised a Christian and I can assure you that if anyone were to parrot this thought back to any of my religion teachers, their mouth would be washed out with soap. It is a perfectly despicable moral and abysmal coda to an already dreadful &#x22;holiday&#x22; film, which does the unthinkable of surpassing Christmas with the Kranks and Jingle All the Way as the most morally jaded holiday film in history. The film also includes a relentless unfunny blooper reel AND a dance sequence that must be seen to be believed...or better yet don&#x27;t see it at all.	1
Absolutely deserving of the worst rating on this website	United States	I never in my life thought a movie would be deserving of a rating a full point lower than &#x22;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.&#x22; Call it a Christmas miracle.There are movies that are boring, there are movies that are factually incorrect, and there are movies that exist solely to pander to a specific audience. This movie is deserving of recognition for, incredibly, setting records in all of these categories. Only an amazingly uneducated person who has expended a large amount of effort sticking their head in the sand for a large portion of their existence could possibly rate this movie in the 2-4 range. Anyone above that is simply bearing false witness (against the Bible&#x27;s commands, by the way) at the request of Cameron himself.	1
This Is Too Bad To Be Funny	United States	Anyone who has seen any of Kirk Cameron&#x27;s previous pseudo-films, which generally consist of a sort of Christian apologetic aimed at the grammar school crowd, may think that they know what to expect with this latest offering, and they would be right. Here is Kirk with his usual mugging and winks to the camera as he leads his audience through a tangled and woefully inaccurate lecture on the mythical &#x22;War on Christmas&#x22;. It is just plain awful. I forced myself to watch until the end and it wasn&#x27;t worth it. It is a really pathetic attempt by a pathetic little man to grab a little cash riding on the coattails of Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News. I was hoping at least it would be stupid enough to be funny, but it was just pedantic, dull and annoying. Miss this one and see a real movie.	1
Awful X1000	United States	I never thought a movie could be as bad as Battlefield Earth, until this was released.The movie starts of literally with no plot and from there it is just Kirk and his &#x22;brother&#x22; Christian talking in a car. Kirk, you have not saved Christmas, you have ruined it just like you did film. What you tried to do is make everyone follow what you think Christmas is all about. Literally, this man cherry picks the Bible and creates his own version of the story. You know it amazes me how Kirk finds a&#x22;good way&#x22; to say &#x22;materialism is right&#x22;. How does he go from making such a great movie like &#x22;Fireproof&#x22; to this???? I am sorry as a Christian, but it was just so bad. Again, Please if you know what&#x27;s good for you, don&#x27;t watch this movie, it is that bad.	1
A complete waste of time	London	I love a really strong, beautiful or funny film that lets me, as a Christian, not be embarrassed about my faith. Saving Christmas had me wanting to climb into a hole. From beginning to end, it plays like one of those late night infomercials where the host is far to excited to be human. This film is nothing but a vanity vehicle for Kirk Cameron, it&#x27;s self congratulatory and he comes off like a 12 year old locked in a toy store over night. His performance is a wreck, his exaggerated enthusiasm is cringe-worthy and at any minute you expect him to giggle and shout &#x22;Hey Ma! I&#x27;m making my own movie.&#x22; This is less a movie about Christmas, Jesus, or anything else as much as it is about Kirk Cameron begging you to look at him as he twirls.	1
Worse than Ebola, Aids, The Black Plague, 9/11 and Bucky Larson combined.	North Pole	Prior to viewing this film I was a devout Christian and Pastor. However this film broke my spirit and has caused me to not only reject my faith in God but in humanity all together.Each scene is worse than the last as Kirk Cameron uses the first portion of the film gathering wood, nails and a microphone to construct what will be int he second half, The worlds largest soap box.As a former pastor I once sat for a 5 hour sermon and still think this film is more preaching than that.When the film ended two thoughts crossed my mind, One was the strangely absent &#x27;That&#x27;s All Folks&#x22; Looney Toones ending and the second was a written apology and or refund of my money.Don&#x27;t watch this film, ever, don&#x27;t subject your family, friends or even stray animals to this picture.Kirk may be trying to silence the critics but the reality is this movie is so horrid so void of content and character that it may induce suicide in the depressed.In summation a 0 ratings needs to exist on IMDb because giving this long winded rambling non non sequitur a 1 is giving it too many stars.	1
Merry Kirkmas	None	Kirk, you set new standards for just how low the bar can be. I don&#x27;t know what genre this movie would fit int but it somehow is humorous and terrifying at the same time. I&#x27;m not sure if it was satire or you really believe in your own bu11sh*t. The message of this movie was so forced and there were more logical fallacies than I could juggle with. I almost recommend others to watch it because the entirety of FAIL this film contains is too much to believe. The record score of 1.5 stars should tell you something, Mr. Cameron. All hope isn&#x27;t lost though, you may make a 1 star film that would make this one look better. Having less arbitrary music, better acting, and improved cinematography over all might be a good start.	1
Kirk Cameron - Hero in the 80s, Pathetic at Best Now	USA	This movie should have never been made, it&#x27;s a farce at best and an insult to the viewer&#x27;s intelligence at best. I used to admire Kirk Cameron when I was growing up in the 1980s, he was a cute star then. It is so sad to see that he is now a fanatical, bible thumping, proselytizing has-been. I&#x27;m sure if you are also a fanatical extremist Christian, this movie will surely appeal to you, and you can share in Cameron&#x27;s sad, lonely little world of fanaticism. However, if you are a non-extremist Christian, or anyone else in the world, you will find this movie to be offensive in at least one or more ways.This movie surely belongs at the bottom of the bottom 100 list. Mr. Cameron, please retire.	1
Everything that needs to be said about this movie has already been said.	United States	When a movie makes the bottom of the IMDb worst movie list, I have to see it in the theater if at all possible. For weeks now, I read the bad reviews, read Cameron&#x27;s plea for fans to up his ratings online, and anticipated this getting cam&#x27;d so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay good money to see it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not even good enough for someone to cam and upload online.The problem is that this movie never should have been released in theaters; it should have been straight to video. More accurately, it never should have been released at all. All this film equates to is a big stroke of Cameron&#x27;s ego. He is clearly in love with himself, and I&#x27;m sure every review, good or bad, makes him feel all the more confident. It&#x27;s sad, but true. Or, maybe he was just trying to do something nice for his family. If you have the money, why not make a movie with your sister so she can feel like a star too. Unfortunately, she probably feels more shame than good.There is no doubt here. This is a bad movie. Yes, I might even say it&#x27;s the worst movie ever. I&#x27;ve never walked out on a movie before, and that record still holds. However, the thought passed my mind several times while watching. I now feel ashamed of myself that I did not. The bastardization of Christianity that this movie inflicts upon the viewer is almost unbearable. I&#x27;m sad to know that I supported Mr. Cameron by paying to see this film. However, I am happy to see this filth voted into oblivion.	1
How wretchedly horrible and insulting	Broken Arrow, Oklahoma	This has to be one of the most insulting and wretched movies of all time. It doesn&#x27;t even look like anyone bothered to edit it competently, much less write a decent script.Don&#x27;t bother with this unless you need to educate yourself on the latest crap out of Kirk Cameron&#x27;s pie hole.Just total garbage. I&#x27;d personally like to know what exactly happened to this kid back in the 90s to cause this mess.Please. If you see this film then give it a review here. People need to be warned fairly about the disgusting nature of it as well as the incompetent work done in it.	1
You have to see this to believe it, I mean it!	Maryland, United States	I&#x27;m kinda in charge of my church&#x27;s youth group. It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m the only guy in their 20s that shows up for church. I don&#x27;t know how we ended up seeing this movie because none of us wanted to see this. The teens didn&#x27;t want to see some religious movie, my pastor didn&#x27;t want to see this because she loathes Kirk Cameron, and I didn&#x27;t want to see it because I wanted to see a good movie. Apparently one of the parents insisted we see a documentary about making Christmas more about Jesus and less about commercialism.Well the jokes on them because shockingly this movie is all about justifying the commercialism of Christmas.I was seriously not expecting that. THis movie throws so much BS at you that it&#x27;s pretty worrying. It&#x27;s also really funny. I think I was the only person who enjoyed this movie. I was hoping that Kirk would have a seeing where he&#x27;s just says insane things like his infamous interview on evolution.This whole movie is insane. I don&#x27;t think anyone was expecting it to be like this with the random dance scenes, the stereotyped black guy, the stereotypical atheist, and everything else.And now here is an example of Cameron&#x27;s crazy points about Christmas: -The Christmas tree is not Pagen, it is because Adam and Eve stole from the tree of knowledge and to make up for the original sin, Jesus returned the fruit which was part of man by hanging himself on a cross, which is made of wood which naturally comes from a tree. So trees are really crosses and the Christmas tree is a cross.I did not make that up, that is seriously an argument he makes.And the whole movie is so insane that you have to see it to believe it. I don&#x27;t think this movie will harm society because I think most Christians who make a big deal about the &#x22;War on Christmas&#x22; will be horrified by this and those who actually buy into it were probably lost causes. But if you want to see a man who clearly needs to be institutionalized just be gloriously and honestly insane, then watch this movie. I haven&#x27;t seen anything this funny since Twilight Breaking Dawn Part II.	1
Transparent drivel	Norway	This is nothing more than a poorly hidden attempt of Cameron to do some preaching and to his fellow Christians by the looks if it. And he does so with the total lack of historical and factual knowledge he is so well known for. This disaster is a mess from the sound, cam job to the post editing if any was done at all. I won&#x27;t even mention the acting because there was none. The logic behind his argument was best illustrated by Penny Walker; Arizona Republic! &#x22;How do you prove a horse is an animal? Because I like Sweden. That&#x27;s the style of absurd logic that happens in &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas&#x22;.I turned the damn thing off half way. I simply couldn&#x27;t stomach any more of his ramblings. Given Cameron&#x27;s track record, I knew it was going to be bad, but thus he reached a new low on his decent in to obscurity. I spent some time thinking of something positive to say about this laughable dung pile, and I came up with one thing. It didn&#x27;t have Ray Comfort in it.	1
Excreatable crap and false propaganda.	New Zealand	Kirk Cameron tries to &#x27;revise&#x27; history to make Christmas have always been about Christianity. Sadly any forth grader with access to a library, or even just Google, can discover this isn&#x27;t true.Cameron uses terrible acting and transparently obvious preachy propaganda to make what surely must be the most banal Christian movie ever.I&#x27;d rather have my internal organs liquefied by flesh eating viruses, than have to watch another second of this crap.It it was JUST boring as hell, or JUST transparent propaganda, or JUST full of &#x27;lies that are OK to tell because it&#x27;s in service of my religion&#x27;, then would be a bad, yet forgettable religious infomercial... I mean movie. But it&#x27;s all that and worse, so I&#x27;m left wishing there was a way to edit out my memory of this abysmal turd of a movie.Ugggh.	1
Cautionary Tale	Los Angeles	Aside from the fact that Mr. Cameron is the dean of the Tool Academy; this is so unwatchable that if Kubric was alive, he would replace all the ultra-violent movies in A Clockwork Orange with this turd and he wouldn&#x27;t even have to induce a gag reflex . . . that much is conveniently built-in. Plot? Acting? This disaster leaves so much to be desired that he should pray for forgiveness for the rest of his days. I do not think Jesus himself would be able to forgive this offensive attempt at art. Is it not enough to embarrass yourself on CNN and YouTube with the bible thumping? He has the temerity to ask people to spend their hard earned money, and precious time enduring this drivel. The rock is ready for you when you&#x27;re ready to crawl back under it.	1
Should have been called Murdering Christmas	Massachusetts	Forget the laughably shoddy production value, the overt preaching, and Kirk Cameron&#x27;s epic social media temper tantrum when the film was critically panned. All you need to know is that Cameron&#x27;s message about Christmas is the opposite of what one would expect from a movie called &#x22;Saving Christmas.&#x22;See, that whole &#x22;saving Christmas&#x22; storyline has been played out in kids&#x27; movies and Hallmark specials over and over again, and it&#x27;s always about stripping away the commercialism and materialism and getting back into friends and family.Kirk does the exact opposite in this film: He CELEBRATES and ENCOURAGES rabid commercialism. And worst of all, he even attempts to justify his materialism -- his greed and narcissism -- by claiming that&#x27;s the good proper Christian thing to do.So if not from rabid consumerism, what is Kirk Cameron trying to save Christmas from? From people celebrating, or even acknowledging the existence of, other holidays besides Christmas, from non-Christians celebrating Christmas, and from Christians celebrating Christmas any other way than the way Kirk Cameron believes you should.In short, this is eighty minutes of Kirk Cameron trying to cram one hundred pounds of his self-absorbed discount-salvation bull**** into a one-pound bag, slap &#x22;Christmas Spirit&#x22; on it with a label maker, and hopelessly attempt to cram it down your throat.Unless you are a raving fascist fundamentalist who only hasn&#x27;t watched this movie because you are afraid of what will happen if you turn your 24/7 Fox News feed off, this movie is guaranteed to make you very angry. It does to Christmas the exact opposite of what the title promises: It delivers unto Christ this biggest black eye in our lifetime.	1
Ho Ho No!	United States	I have never been religious. In fact, the only times I ever step in a church are for weddings and while on vacation in Europe. So, I did not go into Saving Christmas with much of an open mind. But I gave it a chance. A small chance. It was about the time when St. Nick commits murder that I turned it off. Just stay away from this movie. The acting is bad. The only people who might like this movie are death row prisoners on their day of execution, because Saving Christmas makes an hour feel like an eternity. Like I said, I am not the kind of person this movie was made for. But I&#x27;m certain that even if I believed in Jesus and what-not, I would still find this movie awful. Kirk Cameron should be ashamed and embarrassed, but he is not, which makes him guilty of the sin of pride.	1
The Non-War on Christmas	United States	By now, everyone has become familiar with Kirk Cameron&#x27;s delusional and self indulgent attitudes about evangelical Christianity. Most probably also realize that his ideas and opinions are simply wrong. This movie is simply one of his more self indulgent tirades about the supposed removal of Christian themes at Christmas time and how we are all going to Hell. Or something similar. His complete lack of accuracy concerning the actual beginnings of the Christmas holiday not only make the movie a laughable joke, but also showcase his ignorance, therefore ALL Christian&#x27;s ignorance (He seems to like taking credit for speaking for all Christians) A 10 minute search on the internet will inform even the most staunch Catholic that EVERY aspect of Christmas including the iconic Christmas tree, gift-giving, yule logs, etc, were all adapted by early Christian leaders from PAGAN sources! Here&#x27;s another quick fact; Jesus wasn&#x27;t born in December! He was probably born sometime during the Summer months. He is also apparently unaware that when the Puritans settled in America, they OUTLAWED all Christmas celebrations for almost 80 years! We are also treated to more whining about the removal of manger displays, etc from public areas. Yet not a single display on a truly PUBLIC area has been forced to be be removed by public outcry (at least none that I have heard about) Instead, most manger displays that have been removed were on State or Federal property! And yes, THIS IS a violation of the &#x22;Separation of Church &#x26; State&#x22; laws. All in all, the movie is a complete mess! Loaded with self indulgent garbage, this waste of film is also horribly written and directed with acting so far below par as to make a grade school play seems like Shakespeare in the Round. Kirk needs to keep audiences amused with his fire breathing dragons and keep his nose out of major film-making.	1
To call this movies clich is an insult to the word clich.	Houston TX	You know I am not a religious man, yet I like most Christmas and even religious movies but this is the worst out of the horrifically bad 2014 lot. God&#x27;s not dead, Noah, Its a matter of faith no gems in the bunch. No Ben-Hur but this out does them all in how bad it is. Two thirds plus of this movie is not only not uplifting (as I feel a Christmas should be) but it is downright depressing. It is a lot of talk about how this guy is so sad that Christmas is not hyper religious, &#x22;Christian&#x22; the man in the film did something I thought impossible. He made Christmas sad, he made my favorite day of the year a sad pathetic pity party in which only your own wishes matter. Here is to a better 2015 for Christians, and I say that as an atheist, because damn this year was harsh.	1
Didnt even get through the trailer	Kansas City	I didn&#x27;t even get through the trailer... it was so bad that I had to stop halfway through because the lies were already too much. Any sensible person would not watch this movie. The only way this could be comedy is if you think that their ridiculous claims about the origins of Christmas are made in jest... but we all know they are not. Also I was confused. Sounds like the brother was under the impression that Jesus was the &#x22;reason for the season&#x22; anyway and actually just hates the rest of us who don&#x27;t believe that. So why does Kirk go on to explain why everything we associate with Christmas is in the Bible. It&#x27;s like a scientist trying to convince another scientist of gravity when the other scientist already believes in gravity.	1
Yikes!	Boston	Truly the worst serious release of 2014. It fails on so many levels. 1st there is acting, it was comparable to a late night infomercial where you have the straw man doubting things then Kirk explains and boom Kirk&#x27;s explanations was so enlightening that he goes &#x22;I never thought of it that way&#x22; I&#x27;m surprised there wasn&#x27;t a &#x22;wait, we will double the order&#x22; flashing on the screen. Now writing, this has to be a small Christmas miracle in itself, he managed to offend atheist and Christians at the same time. Embrace the commercialism and because Jesus was god made flesh would should indulge the flesh and buy, buy, buy. &#x22;Picture the wrapped gifts as the New Jerusalem&#x22; and point taken from some far fetched sermon about the most important part of Christmas is the swaddling cloth. I wish I was joking but you just can&#x27;t make this stuff up. Last there is the directing choices, hey let&#x27;s shoot the most of it with 2 guys sitting in a car. The movie was lacking material and really feels like it was dragged out. And the pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance is the musical Christmas wrap number.	1
Ho Ho Horrible!	United States	How does a co-star on an 80s sitcom get to be such a loud mouth in the fundamentalist Christian movement? Audacity, I guess. Kirk, there is no war on Christmas -- only people making money off of other people&#x27;s persecution complexes and desire to play the victim. This film is good for a few laughs, until you realize some people actually take this stuff seriously. Looks like it was made by a high school audio video club and it consists of nothing but Fox News type statements about the demonic forces of secularism trying to destroy Christmas (which must be a surprise to those who continue to receive Christmas presents each year and the billions of adds on TV for Christmas bargains). Christians should be more concerned about starving children than whether someone says Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas.	1
Cheap, Condescending Exploitation Masquerading As Family-Friendly Fare	United States	If TV&#x27;s Mike Seaver was truly out to &#x22;put the Christ back in Christmas&#x22;, he would have known better than to go with pathetically dissect-able straw-man arguments and revisionist non-history. If he sincerely felt the need to contribute a faith-positive cinematic effort this holiday season, he could have made a modest effort not to insult the intelligence of his purported ideological peers to such a gross extent. Instead, Kirk Cameron makes a movie that claims to refute secular interpretations of winter solstice celebrations, but instead seems to hold severe contempt for its own target audience.Clearly, Kirk saw the surprising profits enjoyed by the recent wave of low-budget Christian-themed films like &#x22;God&#x27;s Not Dead&#x22; and &#x22;Heaven Is For Real&#x22;, and decided he wanted to get in on the action. Cameron&#x27;s vested interest in this project became clear when he took to Facebook imploring his followers to inflate the poor ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. However, had he might have done better to put half as much energy into a competent production and perhaps a marginal amount of historical research. For that matter,Cameron could use a refresher on his own holy book (how about starting with Hebrews 13:5, 1 Timothy 6:10, Matthew 6:24, Acts 8:20, Isaiah 46:6?) Perhaps he should also review the 9th Commandment.Spoiler alert: Kirk Cameron spends 75 minutes spouting historical inaccuracies to a supporting cast sporting forced smiles, and about 5 minutes setting up unfunny slapstick sequences and obsequious dance segments, both of which are solely for the purpose of padding out the trailer to give impressionable moviegoers the idea that &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas&#x22; is &#x22;light-hearted&#x22; and &#x22;feel-good&#x22;.	1
Dont let your children watch this movie	Sweden	I can not in words convey how awful this movie is. It doesn&#x27;t work as a movie as it is not fun or entertaining in any way. It doesn&#x27;t work as a documentary as it present extremely bizarre ideas as facts.I would put a advisory GP-13 warning on this one. Parents should be strongly cautioned against letting their children watch this. The material may very well be hurtful and inappropriate for children under 13-years.Apparently this movie managed to gross $2.5 million at the box office in a two week run - that is a depressingly high figure and sad testament to the society of today.	5
Serious Piece of Crap	United States	Why? Why? WHY???? This is about 70 minutes of nothing but Kurt Cameron telling everyone how they&#x27;re doing Christmas wrong. I&#x27;ve got news for you, Kurt. Christmas is about celebrating Jesus, and everyone celebrates in a different way. Not only that, but when did you stop even trying to act??? Please... go back to sitcoms, become a preacher, become a writer - just don&#x27;t do ALL of those things, because multi- tasking is not your forte. There are some really good reviews of this movie on here, and that just reminds me of why some people just shouldn&#x27;t be allowed near a keyboard - ignorance, brainwashing, and just plain dumb. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this film. If you want a nice, wholesome - HONEST movie for the holidays, rent the 10 Commandments or Ben Hur.	1
horrible, just horrible even Jesus cries in shame at this	None	this movie is by far worse than anything I have ever imagined. Kirk turns this into an hour long lecture sprinkled with bits and pieces of bible stories. I&#x27;ve been to funerals with more plot than this steaming pile of crap. We get to see two guys talk about nothing for an hour and we get to pay for it! Nice job Kirk. This movie is a sermon, a bad one, that is nothing less than a rant about trying to redeem the holiday, which has never been Christian to begin with. I wish mr cameron would either read his bible (and see that christians are forbidden to decorate &#x27;trees from the field&#x27;) or at least recognize that his cult, er religion, has done nothing but steal other cultures ideas and make them their own. Nice guys. Save your money, if you want to &#x27;save&#x27; Christmas, don&#x27;t see this.	1
Worst. Movie. Ever.	United States	Honestly I didn&#x27;t watch it. I was going to then I seen a video of Kirk Cameron and some dude talking about how Evolution is fake because a banana fits in a hand. This made me realize I was into dudes because a dudes banana fits in my hand. Now I&#x27;m gay because if Kirk Cameron. Thanks Kirk.I guess I should watch it. But honestly Kirk seems like a complete psycho path. I understand he&#x27;s one of those celebrities that cant find work so he found &#x22;God&#x22;. It&#x27;s just sad to see him taking advantage of people who believe in magic invisible sky monsters. SO watch it, don&#x27;t watch it. I wont contribute my valuable time to such a sicko. But you can do what you like!	1
Kirk Cameron Makes Me Want to Be an Athiest	United States	I consider myself a good Catholic boy. Kirk Cameron seems to not understand that the Protestant Christianity that he ascribes to was born out Catholicism, which in turn derives from Judaism. What caused the schism is that there were too many &#x22;unacceptable rules&#x22;, like clergy can&#x27;t get married, no divorce, etc(See Henry VIII) People like Cameron have no faith. Faith, by definition, is belief without certainty or knowledge. Evangelicals are certain there is a God, and even more certain that everything they say, do, and believe is exactly what God wants. The arrogance and total lack of personal humility in these people is astounding and disgraceful. I can&#x27;t imagine any God who isn&#x27;t disgusted by their hateful speech and behavior. That being said, sometimes I feel guilty(being a good Irish Catholic American boy), so I decided to see &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; with no judgment or presupposition in mind. To say the least, it was horrifying, and a giant pile of steaming Ode to Cameron&#x27;s immeasurable ego. Essentially like all of Kirk&#x27;s films, He(Cameron) is in-the-know, and everyone else who disagrees with him, Jew, Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, or any other non-evang. sect of Protestantism is going to hell. To my credit by the way, I saw it all the way through.BTW, if you read the very first reviews on IMDb, all 10 stars from his brainwashed, small-minded followers. Research the movie, Cameron actually encouraged his flock to try and boost the ratings on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. It backfired, which, to me, says that there are more good people who despise hypocritical judgment of others in the guise of religious fervor than not. That&#x27;s encouraging.	1
Mike Seaver is a Believer	United States	I used to like Kirk Cameron as Mike Seaver. Ya know, from Growing Pains? I thought this movie would be as funny as Growing Pains. Apparently Kirk Cameron is a Born Again Christian now? That doesn&#x27;t seem right. Him, Eddie and Boner were always up to no good on Growing Pains. And I don&#x27;t think an actual Christian would&#x27;ve made fun of Carol like that. Remember how Leo DiCaprio got his start on Growing Pains? I wonder if they still talk. Remember the episodes where his brother Ben is into that blonde girl? She went on to play Penny Belding, Mr. Belding&#x27;s daughter on Saved By the Bell. Anyway, I didn&#x27;t much care for this movie. Kirk Cameron&#x27;s character spent too much time talking about Jesus of Nazareth.	1
Just dont...please!	None	This excuse for a &#x22;movie&#x22; is nothing more than a Christian persecution complex disguised as a preachy family film. I couldn&#x27;t make it all the way through. I have no idea how so many Christians think that they&#x27;re under attack in a country that&#x27;s mostly Christian. If you think Christmas is too commercial, then celebrate it differently! I&#x27;m not going to act as though I&#x27;m not disgusted at people being trampled to death under crazed consumers turned to a herd of farm animals in order to score a deal on the new iWhatever go buy for a child too young to appreciate it, but guess what? You don&#x27;t have to participate. Also, why is Happy Holidays so offensive? News flash, this country is a melting pot and people from all over the world come here with different beliefs. I&#x27;m sure EVERYONE who knows you&#x27;re Christian will wish you a Merry Christmas, so why not be a little more cultured and inclusive so the rest of the world will stop laughing at us for a little while?	1
Not a Review	None	I&#x27;m going to be completely honest - I haven&#x27;t seen Saving Christmas. But judging from what others have said about the film, I think I did myself a favor by not seeing it. But I&#x27;m still going to review it, in a way. Not necessarily a review of the film, but more a review of just how well Kirk Cameron took the news about the reviews of his Christian film.In short, he didn&#x27;t take it well at all.When critics panned the movie, Cameron decided to take to Facebook and try to crusade, I guess, against the critics by telling his followers to give the movie a positive review at Rotten Tomatoes. It completely back-lashed and everyone negatively reviewed it instead. I think I read somewhere that there&#x27;s like 175 pages of negative reviews on RT. Hilarious.I don&#x27;t think I need to explain just how telling your fans to positively review your movie is stupid and how less people will like you for it, so I won&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll just assume you have a brain and move on.Negative reviews kept flowing in, and eventually, this became the lowest rated film on IMDb. Why do you think this is? Because the movie is awful? Because there are even some Christians that hate this movie? Well, if you asked Cameron, he&#x27;d say it&#x27;s because of atheists and &#x22;haters&#x22; (God, that&#x27;s a dumb word) campaigning against it. You know, despite the large amount of professional critics, whether Christian or not, giving the film a low rating.Kirk, you are f*cking cancerous. You&#x27;re a cancer upon the film industry and you&#x27;re a cancer upon Christianity.One day I might watch this movie and give a proper review, but until then, I hate it because Kirk Cameron can&#x27;t take any criticism over it.	1
Ummm...WTC?	None	I wanted to say WTF, but all I could think of was, &#x22;What the Christ?&#x22;Yeah, maybe a step over the top considering I&#x27;m an atheist. So yeah, of course I wouldn&#x27;t like this movie. To be honest, I only watched the trailer. Enough for me to give it one star. If there was an option to erase the movie from my memory and from the public domain completely, I would have taken that one.Christmas (really, the holidays in general), are not about Christ. This time of year is about giving and thanking. Yeah, we all say we love to give, but oh boy that new flat screen sure makes me a happy man. And the fact that people have to pull politics and religion into this time of year is disappointing.Anyway, this movie is not worth the time of the trailer. Heed my warning, and stop now! Just love one another (or so the saying goes), and enjoy this time of year! It&#x27;s cold and miserable, but somewhat magical. Just wear protection.	1
masterfully brilliant	None	If the world hate me, so shall it hate you.. these words of prophecy spoken by none other than Jesus Christ the Eternal Master Himself whose birthday is celebrated at this Most Glorious Time of year every year..Welcome be the critics placing true genius at the bottom rung of the proverbial totem pole, which comes as no surprise to those true geniuses and artists, for this is the design of the ages and is so meant. SOMEONE has to be bottom of the ladder. And First step. Why not a great work of Christian Family Cinematic genius as has been deemed by the critics. For which we are most and eternally grateful and thankful. Merry Christmas to you all. Christians, atheists and all critics and fans. MERRY Christmas TO ALL!	1
Cinematic equivalent of a car accident	Vegas baby	Wife and I visited the multiplex tonight and saw the excellent &#x22;Whiplash&#x22; and then decided to stay for &#x22;Citizenfour&#x22;. We needed to kill an hour between films, so we ducked into &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22;. She played solitaire on her phone for an hour. No one minded because we were the only two people in the theater. This film was the single most disturbing yet simultaneously hilarious experience I have ever had at the movies. The guy is obviously deeply in love with himself, and is so brainwashed that every time he looks directly into the camera with his vacant, smug, slightly cross-eyed stare, I was totally creeped out. He has about the same intellectual capacity for rational thought as my poodle. I actually think he may be a robot. He manages to say something that would offend every demographic group out there in a way not seen since Andrew Dice Clay, only he&#x27;s not trying to be funny (I think, not sure). Wife wanted to hang out in the restroom rather than sitting through any more cinematic defecation, but I couldn&#x27;t tear myself away. Had to leave before the much hyped dance sequence. As an atheist, I gave it a ten as a good will gesture. No hard feelings. Heaven help you, Kirk!	10
Kirk is a great guy, but this film just isnt very good	United States	As a Christian, I love Kirk Cameron, he is a truly great guy who is serving the Lord very well. Unfortunately, though his intentions were good for this film, and it might be what GOD wanted, but I really kind of think that this time he may have made a mistake. This is the kind of film that may work for Churches to show their members, but the quality isn&#x27;t very good, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t work as a public film. It usually angers me a lot when people give low ratings to Christian films (particularly the new &#x22;Left Behind&#x22;). But for this movie I really can&#x27;t blame people for giving it a low rating, I would too if I wasn&#x27;t a fan of his.	5
30 minutes of content, the balance was crap	Iowa	The introduction was slow. The five of us were in our queen-sized bed watching it on my laptop, and my 6-year-old passed out before the introduction was over. Not knowing about the movie prior, I would have thought this was how it was going to be throughout it, which made me a little nervous. I kept looking over at my 9-year-old to check if she was still paying attention. Thankfully she&#x27;s got a longer attention span than my 6-year-old.The movie starts with Kirk Cameron attending his sister&#x27;s huge Christmas party that she throws every year. The house is gorgeous&#x96; everything is decorated beautifully, there are a ton of people and lots of food. Kirk asks his sister where her husband is, and she explains he&#x27;s just not feeling Christmas this year. Kirk then goes out to the car where he finds his brother-in-law sulking and grouchy, complaining about how all of this STUFF isn&#x27;t what Christmas is really about! How it&#x27;s all Pagan!Kirk goes on to combat each one of his brother-in-law&#x27;s objections about the Christmas traditions; the Christmas tree, Santa, Christmas lights, and gifts. Each objection is given a story. My 9-year-old&#x27;s favorite was seeing Santa beat a guy up! You&#x27;ll have to watch the movie to find out why Santa beats this man up:)Overall, I enjoyed the content of the movie--not the fluff. Some parts were really corny, but I think that was Kirk&#x27;s intent. They poked fun at Pentecostal Christians. There were several scenes where I found myself saying, &#x22;I don&#x27;t understand how this fits?&#x22; or &#x22;I don&#x27;t feel this explains his intent very well.&#x22; Santa was spot-on, but a lot of the explanations seemed like a very high-level overview that left me feeling a lot like Concrete Blonde&#x27;s lyrics:These little conversations Well for me they&#x27;ll never do Now what am I supposed to do with Broken sentences of you? Like a book with missing pages Like a story incomplete Like a painting left unfinished It feels like not enough to eat.I would have loved to see more depth to the stories told. The movie is about 69 minutes long, 30 minutes of which had content&#x85; the rest was just, &#x22;fluff&#x22;. I&#x27;m not sure I would spend $10 at the theater for it. It&#x27;s more suited for a TV special.Towards the end of the movie, there is a hip hop dancing scene that made me really uncomfortable. From reading the credits, I understand this is some sort of faith-based hip hop dance crew, but I felt it wasn&#x27;t very appropriate for the movie. I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself a prude, either&#x85;it just felt odd.If you ignore those minor details, I think you&#x27;ll enjoy this movie, too! This was unlike some of Kirk Cameron&#x27;s movies that are more like a documentary&#x96;this was part story, part documentary...I think.I think what sealed the deal on the film was what Kirk said in summary,&#x22;We need to make traditions of our own. We need to infuse old symbols with new meaning. We need to arrange our lives and our homes so that every single thing points to Jesus. &#x22;Also,&#x22;Remind your children that every character in God&#x27;s story has a place.&#x22;	2
*GASP* It is not the worst movie ever!	None	Well, I finally went to see the movie. There were actually good crowd. Everyone is setting this out to be a horrible movie. While I admit it is not the best movie I have ever seen it is by far NOT the worst. It was entertaining. I even laughed a little (But not as much as the elderly couple beside me). There were some highlights and other spots that could have better potential. But it served its point. I left pondering the content. What is Christmas about? While it probably won&#x27;t put &#x27;Christ back in Christmas&#x27; world wide it can cause individuals to have a change of heart. Why shouldn&#x27;t everyone Christmas with a major dance party?	7
Who went to this movie expecting anything other than what was delivered	United States	Did you seriously go expecting something else. The movie delivered exactly what was advertised a frank discussion of the traditions of Christmas from a Christian view. I knew what I was going to see and I enjoyed it. For those who have not seen it, this is a discussion of something we as evangelical Christians have heard for many years. Does the celebration of Christmas and the inclusion of everything not Jesus make us less of a believer. Cameron puts forth the argument that not embracing our long held traditions is an attack on Christmas itself and why we should be OK with each one. Could it have been more cinematically engaging, yes, but I enjoyed the movie.	8
Live and let live!	NC	&#x22;Live and let live&#x22; comes to mind when I see all the 1-star reviews. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not so nosy that I&#x27;d go on the internet and give 1-star reviews to a movie that is not even in my categories of movies I&#x27;d ever watch. I don&#x27;t care about sports, but I don&#x27;t go around ripping on the fact that sports exists, nor do I personally attack other people for liking sports. I saw the movie just to see what it was about and to see what they did with it. I&#x27;ve never researched Christmas so I can neither confirm nor deny any of the arguments. I don&#x27;t know where the symbols came from. I choose to decorate by my own personal likes and dislikes and not other people&#x27;s opinions. What I walked away from the movie feeling was, &#x27;don&#x27;t let the haters embitter you and take the joy out of your own personal celebration.&#x27; Keep the joy in your Christmas celebration, whether you 100% with zero doubts fully understand every single aspect or not. For those of you who believe and celebrate Christmas, Have a joyous Christmas! For those of you who don&#x27;t believe and resent the existence of Christmas, why don&#x27;t you go look up something on a topic that you like rather than stress yourself out by enraging yourself to the point of wanting to attack other people. Live and let live.	7
It was fine.	None	More of a sterilized sermon than a movie. I thought the movie was paced a little slow but in the end the movie was enjoyable and had a since of humor. I&#x27;m sure it was polarizing for many and that many that have panned it never saw it. My wife and I both enjoyed the movie and it gave a great platform for extensive discussion. I especially enjoyed the refocus on the Christmas Tree. It gave me no new information but a little different perspective on the tree and its importance. The movie has no real plot but is rather one group&#x27;s (obviously Kirk didn&#x27;t make this film by himself) explanation for the significance and enjoyment of Christmas. I saw no real reason to involve the story of St. Nicholas with the Lord of the Rings, but it was more history of the church than most people ever get.	8
Very worth watching	Chesapeake, VA	Overall, I thought it was a great Christian movie. The message of celebrating Christmas instead of getting so wrapped up in the arguments over certain details of the celebration I think was lost on a lot of people, given how many people rated it low based on particular details of his description of the holiday. There were parts of it that I felt he was &#x22;reaching with&#x22; as well (particularly his explanation of the Christmas tree) but a lot of other thoughts that were very thought provoking to me (his take on the birth of). Besides, I personally love hearing other people&#x27;s opinions and beliefs. =)) To me, the worst parts of the movie were the &#x22;lecture style&#x22; intro and the dance scene in it...but again, the movie itself I thought was very thoughtful and thought provoking, and I personally LOVED the &#x22;Celebrate Christmas&#x22; message it contained. The script was well written and the acting surpassed most independent films (which people tend to forget it was).Basically, if you&#x27;re not the type of person to say &#x22;It&#x27;s Kirk Cameron, I&#x27;m going to hate it&#x22;, then it&#x27;s more than worth watching, if you are that type of person, then definitely don&#x27;t waste your time. It&#x27;s someone of strong faith using his artistic ability to spread his beliefs to anyone who wants to hear his message, and based on that fact I give it a 10. It&#x27;s not a message that&#x27;s popular in our culture, and especially not popular in secular Hollywood.	10
I condemn you to hell!	Ireland	Saving Christmas is a fabulous movie that we&#x27;ll all be watching for years to come. This movie celebrates Christmas in all it&#x27;s glory and tells us what it&#x27;s really about, Jesus Christ. &#x22;I condemn you to hell!!!&#x22;, I roared at the devil-worshipers who were shaking their heads after the film ended. This movie truly is &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; before all the anti-Christs finally fill our joyous hearts with Illuminati! I&#x27;m speaking to the last of us saviors; grab your cross, get your torches fired up, bring your pitchforks as we will reign our terror on all the no-good doers that walk on our planet! Jesus Christ shall ooze from all of your souls!!! WE CONDEMN YOU ALL TO HELL!!!!!!Thank you, 10/10.	10
Best movie ever!	Sweden	This movie is a masterpiece from the story to the acting is 10/10 I don&#x27;t think anything could have made this movie better. The special effects where amazing i have never seen anything that good in my hole life. Darren Doane where the perfect choice for directing this movie he knew exactly how this movie should be and he delivered. The only negative about the movie was that it was to short.Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 directing 10/10 special effects 10/10 I would probably rank it #3 for the best movie ever made where lord of the rings is number #1 personallywatch it now!!!	10
Saved My Christmas	None	This movie enlightened me, made me laugh and gave me food for thought. Isn&#x27;t that what Kirk was trying to accomplish? For those of you that gave it a negative review - shame on you. You obviously missed the meaning of this movie. For those of you that didn&#x27;t see it...should. It brought together all the things we think of at Christmas and gave them actual meaning - and how Christ relates to each one. I can&#x27;t wait to see this come out on DVD so that I can share it with those that missed the opportunity to see it with me. This movie also didn&#x27;t give the viewer too much to process - just enough to get the meaning across. It&#x27;s up to me (and you) to delve into God&#x27;s word to learn more to find out more about each of the story lines in this movie. I want to know more...and that is what Kirk Cameron was trying to get us to do. #SavingChristmas #KirkCameron #KirkSavedMyChristmas	10
A History of Christmas Tradition	Canyon Lake, Texas	We wanted to see this movie because we read on the synopsis that it was a Christian explanation of Christmas traditions. As Christians who are a little overwhelmed by the commercialization of the celebration of the birth of Christ, we appreciated the way this movie made us appreciate even the more secular appearing traditions. It all comes down to one&#x27;s posture of heart, whether it&#x27;s one&#x27;s Christmas celebrations or one&#x27;s attitude toward this film. If you just want to escape and be entertained, choose another movie, this is not that type of entertainment. But if you are looking to reconnect with beloved traditions in a more meaningful way, this movie will give you something to think about. We loved it!	10
Not a bad movie -Unfortunately a link to this page was posted....	None	Funny at times. Has a good message. Makes you feel good at the end, restore your faith in humanity. I&#x27;m not too sure about his friend, sketchyI think the idea is correct about putting Christ back in Christmas. I hope it makes a lot of money. Nothing wrong with a GOOD Christmas movie. It&#x27;s a lot better than &#x22;Bad Santa&#x22; or some of the other terrible Christmas movies I will not let my kids watch. The movie seemed a bit long, and the plot was a bit predictable except for the end (I wont spoil it for you) Unfortunately a link to this page was posted on a homosexual website, and they requested that people down vote the movie, so the results we are seeing may be inaccurate :(	9
one star reviews likely not real reviews, activists weighing in on Jesus himself:)	None	Anyone that isn&#x27;t a religion despiser has to be honest; this movie rocks. It was heartwarming adorable and really really fun. Yes the plot was limited, but hey, so are the plots of many very enjoyable entertaining flicks:) It had enough plot to be interesting and enough endearing holiday garb and jingle to boost my holiday season. I am amazed at the emotion ....and sheer LENGTH (college term paper length) of some of the very inaccurate wildly neg reviews. These folks obviously are &#x27;activisting&#x27; not &#x27;movie reviewing&#x27; or they wouldn&#x27;t be so emotional; but rather they would be doing a shorter &#x27;matter of fact&#x27; review,....like is normal:)I saw Saving Christmas at the &#x27;Egyptian&#x27; theater at Arundel Mills mall on Dec 15th. My son went with my husband and I. It was ridiculous that the movie was so hard to find. We drove 30 min to see it:)...because we heard it was really good and represented our heart on Christmas. Regardless of ones view on that matter, there is nothing to despise and attack about this light hearted beautiful film. It is great,exceptional acting (which surprised me). It was really well written and put together from start to finish. Anybody badly bashing this film in an unusually lengthy manner,is simply on a lib activist rant and should be refraining from showing that ulterior nonprofessional motive so obviously:) Mr. Cameron came up with a very good quality film with a well chosen cast. It was a highlight of our Christmas this year and it deserved to be in more theaters! I hope he initiates another film for next Christmas, I would be in the front of the line going in:)	10
What did everybody think this movie was about?	United States	I went with my niece because she wanted to and I was not expecting much. the movie had a nice message, there was no gang wars, no cussing for no reason, no girls dry humping anything in sight. If you want to take a younger person to a move and not have to worry about sex scenes, murders, drug use or exploding cars. I do not always want to go see an over acted movie, with over the top special effects, sometime I think they have some special effect just to show off how great they are, and over directed. Some time you just want to go to a movie with a cheerful message and as a religious person I liked the message as did my niece. I do not need a movie that is as much about evil as it is about good to enjoy myself.	10
Point of View	United States	Really, why are so many atheists even rating this movie? Did they really watch it? Why would they? I can see why they would hate it, and I don&#x27;t blame them. It&#x27;s totally opposite their point of view.I gave it a ten rating, not because I&#x27;m trying to help out Kirk Cameron, although I have to admit it&#x27;s not the greatest movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. I can&#x27;t even say I agree with everything in the movie. But - and this is important to me when it comes to movies - it made me think. It made me want to go home and do some research. And I found that there are other sources out there who back up what the movie says. Also, I did think the movie was funny. Maybe I&#x27;m just easily amused.	10
Funny and Faith based movie	United States	This movie is extraordinarily different than all other Christmas movies. It&#x27;s sometimes hilarious and serious about faith other times. I&#x27;ve been ready for years for someone to take Hollywood head on with the truth about the true meaning of Christmas! If you&#x27;re looking to have a good time with your kids and let them watch something that will leave them with a better curiosity of what Christmas means, then check this movie out at your local theater. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the movie won&#x27;t win an Oscar, but you&#x27;ll have a smile on your face when you leave the theater. Kirk Cameron takes his faith and Christmas very serious and has been trying to get a movie like this made for years. Like most of us, I love all the old classic Christmas movies and will for the rest of my life. But, there&#x27;s not many of them that address the truth behind what Christmas is all about. I recommend this movie to all families!	8
Great Movie	USA	This movie is great and it has a great message. It is everything I expected it to be while explaining in a cue and funny way what Christmas is really about! While it is not a great cinematic production it was never designed to be. It is based around the belief that people need to realize that Christmas is a great celebration and worship of the greatest event in history!! When it comes out on video I hope the tide will turn and more people will accept it for the simple movie of truth it was designed to be. I do not always agree with Kirk Cameron but this time he has the message of Christmas in a great context. Everyone should at least watch this movie one time, Jesus is the reason for the season.	10
To Carnal Christian and to The Gospel rejecting population need to learn Biblical History	United States	This is my updated review on Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas, and it has been submitted to IMDb for review.. Will it be on IMDb? I would say more of a no, than a yes.(1) Book of Genesis and the Origins of trees (God created the trees) and winter solstice (astronomy of the planets aligning with this particular solar system), and their actual meanings; (2) Book of Exodus - specifically about the Tabernacle and what inside of the Structure, and their references; (3) Saint Nick (known as Santa Clause) and that he was part of the Council of Nicea, that he was also born-again, and help others with gifts. (4) Books of the Gospels (which are technically Old Testament) - Tree is the main central theme, in that Christ is God Incarnate (Fully Man and Fully God); He (Christ/Messiah) was born in swaddling (burial) clothes, that He was meant to die. He couldn&#x27;t sin at all, and He was tested at all points, and still did not sin at all; He (Christ/Messiah) was beaten, Crucified on a Roman built Cross, died, covered in swaddling clothes, then buried for 3 days and 3 nights, and rose again (Resurrected). Why did He (Jesus Christ/Yeshua Messiah) do this? He did it for you, for every man, woman, and child is born a sinner because of Adam in the book of Genesis sinned, and we inherited this sin nature. This is what the movie is really about! It&#x27;s about the Gospel, that Christ died for sinners! People who say &#x27;Christmas is pagan&#x27;, need to watch this movie, and then go back to the Origins, from the book of Genesis, whether&#x27;s it&#x27;s in your Torah or Tanak, New Testament, Gospels, History, Apostolic Writings, and/or Bible. This movie is really a commentary of Biblical History, and that you can still receive Salvation for your sins, and that you can be a child of God through Christ&#x27;s Blood Sacrifice (The Perfect Lamb of God, Old Covenant typology).The media in news and movie reviewers view &#x22;evil is good&#x22;, and &#x22;good is evil&#x22;, and view this as the &#x22;worst movie ever&#x22; (in reference to Saving Christmas).. Really, it&#x27;s the worst movie ever? Are you sure? What about James Cameron&#x27;s Titanic, which really wasn&#x27;t about the Titanic? I mean, you see the Titanic here and their, but it&#x27;s about adultery, if you understand the term and it&#x27;s origins: engagement, and it really means = to be married.What about Michael Bay&#x27;s Transformers (2007)? You get the Transformers with very few lines to them (robot characters), and the lines are given to an actor and an actress, who are unknown until this movie came out. I felt like I was watching a cross-between Bill &#x26; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure and Clueless (which I can&#x27;t recommend either movie). I would hear from people in my area, that it was &#x22;a good movie!&#x22; and &#x22;Megan Fox is hot!&#x22;, and in translation: &#x22;Good special effects, hot girl, and no substance to the story at all.&#x22; Is their such a thing called movie plagiarism? It would apply to this particular movie!What about the recent Noah by Darren Aronofsky? This is behind the grade F-, and it fact, this is a very heretical version of Noah. It only had about 5 good points to the mass amount of liberties and rejects the Biblical History altogether..What did these three do, along with other movies who fall hard in Hermeneutical and Exegetical (Science and Art of Interpretation, letting the writer(s) speak for themselves, and having good application to what&#x27;s being written/said) standards? In the fiction historical background, and non-fiction (literal history) accounts who fail to follow manuscripts in history, and it fact, people get praised to doing something that receives an F-, and get ridiculed for A+ when it comes to movies, documentaries, and commentaries. It&#x27;s really: &#x22;Let&#x27;s apply A+ to Ivy Leagues with their buy-out program&#x22; and &#x22;Let&#x27;s apply F- to who understand True Interpretation of things.&#x22;In today&#x27;s society and since the 1920s-1930s, the view is: &#x22;reject it: if it convicts us, you need to a full 180 in your so-called life style (it&#x27;s really a death-style), corrects these forms of so-called theologians views (nazists, fascist, communists, socialists = aka liberal and moderates), has True Supernatural substance to it, and it&#x27;s True Historical accounts, it doesn&#x27;t do my homework (research) for me&#x22; which Saving Christmas actually does. Yep, you get to your homework (research) on this Bible Commentary, Bible History, and actually documentational History (do Origin Source Research)..While the majority of society (not just in North America) embrace superficiality (i.e. Transformers, Titanic, Noah), and reject Hermeneutical and Exegetical standards, and perform Eisegesis (let&#x27;s take a mass amount of liberties, and give a folklore, myths, add deceptions here and their), and it does my homework (research) for me. It&#x27;s: &#x22;Oh, I don&#x27;t have to my homework for me! Hooray! I can be lazy!&#x22; Come on! Push yourself! Overwhelm your selfishness! Do the homework! Stop being lazy!This is a great example, to show, that Kirk Cameron wants to speak the majority who are in the two world-views: (a) Laodicean society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of Revelation, Chapter 3). (b) Corinthian society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of 1st and 2nd Corinthians).	10
Great Content  Great Quotes... Santas the man!	None	I saw this movie, with a bunch of friends &#x26; family at a Regal theater. Although it was a different style than what I was expecting, in that there was a lot of narration, the overall content was great! Basically, it was a celebration of the meaning of Christmas and it had funny one-liners like...&#x22;Santa&#x27;s the Man!&#x22; Plus, I really enjoyed the scene with the two guys who were rapping behind the mugs were hilarious! Lol #GoodTimes The actual filming too had some nice effects that flowed well with the story-line. I bet most of the people writing reviews are &#x22;haters&#x22; who didn&#x27;t even see it! #YouKnowItsTrue #BahHumbug Great Job to those who made this! Great Information! Merry Christmas!	10
One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time	United States	I viewed this movie the first week it came out, and it is simply a wonderful movie. Every movie that Kirk Cameron does is great. All freedom loving, patriotic Americans will love this movie. Do not be fooled by all the bad reviews by all the lefty, Obama loving, liberals putting down this wonderful movie. None of the people who have given this movie a bad rating have even seen this movie. If they had actually viewed the movie, they too would love it. The movie itself concerns Kirk Cameron speaking to his brother-in-law about the joys of Christmas and the joys of loving, close knit families. This is another reason all the loony left hates this movie, they hate anything to do with intact, man-woman, families or God. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie.	10
Definitely not a 10, nor a 1	USA	This movie is not a &#x27;10&#x27;, and not a &#x27;1&#x27;, either. Why are the vast majority of the votes either 1&#x27;s or 10&#x27;s, then? Because people are voting their worldview, instead of voting on a movie.It is hard to categorize this film - if I had to categorize it, I would call it a Christian docudrama, or Christian Christmas movie. In my opinion, an hour long television program would have been a better format for this effort, than an hour and twenty minute theatrical release.It is a low-budget digital independent film, and the production values reflect that. It sets out to present a conservative Christian point of view, and does that openly and unapologetically. There was nothing that I found intolerant or mean spirited, and it seemed rather to espouse traditional Christian values of Christmas, such as &#x22;Peace on Earth, Goodwill toward All&#x22; - although that line does not occur in the film.The bottom line is: if you are a conservative Christian, then you will probably enjoy this movie or at least find it interesting. The further your worldview departs from that, the less enjoyable you will likely find it.	6
Semi-documentary--Meant to Inform More Than Entertain	United States	I like Kirk Cameron&#x27;s stuff. Let me put that out there. I understand where he is coming from and tend to enjoy it. &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; was informative but draggy. The format--two guys speaking together in a parked car on a driveway--tends to make the movie narrative and leads to an extremely slow pace. With a little livelier pacing and some editing (to remove the pregnant pauses), the message could have been presented in 45 minutes. I did not go into this movie thinking it would be a comedy, so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. However, the comic relief presented was a little strained and contrived.There is, actually, very little acting. The descriptive parts frame a number of vignettes that illustrate what is being discussed. In between different themes, a party is going on. Some of the party sequences made little sense. There is one sequence where two coworkers are talking behind coffee cups (presumably to keep from being seen on video discussing things at work) which has absolutely nothing to do with moving the story and, mercifully, is never addressed again until the out-takes.That having been said, I came away with some information that I did not know or had never thought about before seeing the movie. I believe the message should be heard by Christians and, thankfully, it is aimed directly at Christians. I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my time in the movie, but I feel like it could have been presented more evenly. My suggestion is to support Mr. Cameron by seeing his other stuff and borrowing this movie from the Church Library.	3
Finally, a REAL Christmas movie	None	A wonderful and fun spirited NON Hollywood movie about keeping Christ in Christmas with NO Hollywood liberal agenda or spin involved. Must see for Christians. No cursing, no questioning God or religion. It was really refreshing when everything that seems to ooze out of Hollywood (including the actors themselves) these days, is either bashing the foundations of this great country or bashing Christians. Kirk Cameron tackles the traditions and questions about Christmas and it&#x27;s commercialization head on and with no apologies. If you are a Christian and it is your favorite Holiday as it is mine, Saving Christmas is a must see.	10
Awesome Movie	Minneapolis, MN USA	I saw the movie, and it was great. Interesting, funny, enlightening - I loved it. On Reddit I saw that readers are calling on &#x22;all atheists&#x22; to give this movie a 1 Star rating - even if they haven&#x27;t seen it. Don&#x27;t believe the low rating its been getting. Very misleading. Kirk does an excellent job of putting together a family friendly film. It&#x27;s not too preachy - it&#x27;s actually anything but that. The characters are endearing. The jokes come at all the perfect times. My family got the biggest kick out of some of the humor. Way better than 99% of the garbage Hollywood puts out these days. I guarantee anyone rating it low has not actually seen it, and are simply haters.	10
Educational movie with a touch of family comedy	United States	Made me think more about the reasons for celebrating Christmas. Helps me to see that I can focus on the true meaning of Christmas while partaking in the celebrations of the season. The main character named Christian did an excellent job and was enjoyable to watch. The others in the cast provided the right amount of lighthearted humor. There was a good balance of scenes between Christian and Kirk Cameron and the main party. Kirk Cameron is known for producing great movies and people have a certain expectation from his films. This film seems to be marketed as a full action comedy which sets expectations different than what the movie actually is. I liked it. Just know it has more of an educational approach with light humor.	7
Perfect film to smash the humbugs	United States	People who are sick of the commercialization of Christmas and are ready to give it all up will appreciate this movie. People who are not familiar with Christianity will not get this movie or think it&#x27;s bogus. However anyone familiar with the history of the church will recognize the story of Nicolas of Myrna and his role in the Council of Nicea. The recounting of the events of the original St. Nick will put a new spin on the Ho Ho Ho! This was a great way to spend an afternoon leading up to the celebration of the birth of Christ. It&#x27;s not a special effects bad guy hero film, but it is what it promises to be and it fulfills its promises well. I highly recommend it and wish it was going to be in theaters longer.	10
Educational Movie - Made For TV Quality	United States	Well we saw the movie. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I thought it was going to be a regular movie. Instead, it was an educational movie; he gave you different reasons, ideas and ways to think about the Christmas of today. He also discussed how the different factions would like you to think about Christmas; it&#x27;s all Pagan, there&#x27;s nothing about Christ left in it, why the tree, why the 25th of December, etc., and how to keep it based on faith, etc. Not bad. Internet Haters will hate on this but this movie isn&#x27;t for the regular movie public, it&#x27;s for believers and kids. I do agree that the poster is misleading; if you judge the movie by the poster you would think that it&#x27;s a comedy - family - faith based movie. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s an educational, faith based movie, with a few laugh, but it&#x27;s not a scripted comedy in the least. Run time was short as well which was good. Pretty tight and to the point.	7
The fact that aspiring actors, directors, and writers cant find work while this crap is produced is absolutely appalling.	United States	*Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldnt be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this film, I could write my shortest review, ever. Dont see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think Ill go on for a bit.I dont know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesnt matter. Theyre all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, its film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films get away with it, Ill give Disaster Movie a pass here).The jokes are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (theres some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I dont care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization.	1
Not Humorous...in the least bit	United States	I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this film. How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled Disaster Movie, should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being Twister. How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldnt say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I cant believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. Its an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.Rating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour Manos: The Hands of Fate marathon than watch this slop.	1
Theres just no point anymore	Canada	Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, Im just going to be making a few observations and points Ive deduced.Theres just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know theres going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, THIS IS SPARTA! and, IM RICK JAMES BITCH so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Dont see this movie. Dont spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and then silently judge the people that are talking about this movie on Monday. Do yourself a favor.	1
The irony is very correct.	Canada	Since the name of the movie is Disaster Movie. The basic irony is that its a ****ING DISASTER! A 90 minute **** flick based on pop culture and movie trailers. My god, Seltzer, retire and live off the money you made from your other below 3 star rated pieces of horse ****, please. Now when you do these type of movies, youre never going to get the jokes in 5 years, maybe even 2. Theyre just wasting their time, not really. Theyre just wasting our time. But whoever goes and sees this are brainless (Hypocrite moment) but bare with me, I got in for free and I regret it.A free ticket, and a bad nightmare.Do not watch this, support other films that are coming out today whom deserve it more.Come on, do you REALLY want more of these? **** guys, just ****.	1
Awful, pure stupidity	United States	This movie I saw a day early for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. It is totally brain dead. Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see Idiocracy? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. Date Movie was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes spoofs (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with Meet the Spartans and Superhero Movie all falling flat.Well Ive wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, dont see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.Thanks, R	1
Wait... What?	United States	Honestly, what is wrong with you, Hollywood? Not only is this the WORST thing that has happened to you ---- you keep funding these cheesy writers of Scary Movie to make these movies. I mean, come on Carmen Electra, you know even better than them that you have potential! Stop portraying in parody movies! See, I cant believe I am comparing parody to this movie. This movie has no parody or comedy in it, this is all referencing. All they need to do is see a movie title, take a line and a scene from a trailer, and turn it into a script. Never in my LIFE have I ever been so ticked off by you (Hollywood).I mean, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, you dont even care for the money, you just want to prove you can be a film-maker too, but thats not the point! Movies are something you should enjoy, and this... this is making bland jokes and pointless (as I may say comedy) with fart jokes and people being hit with objects... or just getting hurt (but you realize that they are okay)?Now please, STOP! Youre ruining the name of parody and you are causing people to hate you even more!Please, as a warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS.	1
Someone please put an end to Seltzers awful career	Cold Spring, KY	I was given a free ticket to this film; so I cant complain that I was ripped off (except in that some 90 minutes of my life were irretrievably stolen from me). These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) havent been funny for some time now but Disaster Movie has reached a new low. There wasnt one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged jokes were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but Disaster Movie may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it.	1
Disastrous	Upstate New York	OK, so Disastrous isnt an imaginative barb for this movie, but then theres not a shred of wit to the movie, so....I saw this movie for free. A friend who said he pissed his pants at the trailer had free passes. I think hes incontinent.A spoof of disaster movies might have been fun. This is not it. A couple disaster movies get referenced, not really spoofed. Instead, the spoofing is of recent movies of all genres, and of aspects of current pop-culture. Then again, how current is womens wrestling or the Head On commercials?If theres anything about it thats good, theres the 70 minute or so running time (where did they get 90 minutes?) and Nicole Parker seems like she might be good, if she had good material.	1
Never EVER make a bet with your friends	United States	If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. Ill tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well Ive been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my friends and that wasnt a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well Im warning you at least. It shouldnt even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..Im sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).Oh and please, the random wrestling scene? I dont know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldnt have something in a movie that doesnt add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you wouldve gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps Im grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.But lastly (well Ive got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.I give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies, or mediocre for that matter.	1
My Eyes!!!!	United States	Its hard to imagine anyone writing a spoof movie even worse than Meet the Spartans, but Seltzer and Friedberg have pulled it off. Its not even just a little worse. It makes Spartans look like Raiders of the Lost Ark in comparison. You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out.May Contain Spoilers....if you care: First off, as it appeared in the trailer, this movie does not spoof, or really even reference disaster movies at all. The set shakes a few times, there are some plastic asteroids, and a bad cgi tornado, all of which that do nothing to add anything to the movie, but other than this theres nothing even relating this to said style of film. Instead we get references (not to be confused with actual spoofs) to such films as High School Musical, Step Up, this summers crop of comic based films, Enchanted, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Kung Fu Panda, and Sex and the City. I cant wait to hear Seltzer and Friedberg praise their own genius and describe this movie as being modeled around Cloverfield...they clearly tried to do this, but other than the outline of the small group of people running through the city trying to find the injured girlfriend, theres nothing relating this piece of crap to the monster movie.I can honestly say I did not laugh once at this movie. All of the jokes were forced, and many of them were dragged on for several minutes at a time...the two writers clearly thinking they were onto some kind of comedy gold here. Probably the most insulting thing about this movie is, like all their other gems: Epic, Date, Spartans, they consider the audience to be mentally challenged...having to tell us point blank what movie it is they are referencing (again...not spoofing) Such lines like: Its an inconvenient truth, its global warming, Come here you kung fu panda, what is this enchanted place, How do you know all this? I know because I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Let me get my Get Smart phone (proceeds to talk on his shoe), and whats with the marching band? I thought Id cheer you up with a high school musical all exist to make sure were in on their super intelligent antics.Please, save your money for anything else. Show Hollywood that they need to stop these two guys from making any more movies. I cant even imagine a 5 year old finding this stuff funny. Speaking of 5 years old, thats about how long many of these jokes will last before absolutely no one can find them funny anymore since, as usual, most of them are simply based on pop culture references.	1
An honest comment from someone who has actually seen the movie	Chicago, Illinois	Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the way everyone talks about these guys are as if they are on America&#x27;s Most Wanted List, boy there is a lot of hate before the release date of Disaster Movie. They have brought us the &#x22;stupid&#x22; comedies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, pretty much all those movies have had the same hate, I can understand why. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C&#x27;s and D&#x27;s, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it&#x27;s the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie, didn&#x27;t mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy&#x27;s previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you&#x27;ll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.Disaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. There are just some fun moments, I think it&#x27;s ridicules that some people can not admit that. That&#x27;s the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn&#x27;t even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining... this isn&#x27;t the IMDb that I know, it&#x27;s silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie, my main thing that I&#x27;m upset with, this movie didn&#x27;t need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.1/10	1
Worst. Movie. Ever.	United States	First things first: disregard the rating above because they dont allow for rating low enough for this movie. I would honestly say 0 for real numbers although negative would be more appropriate since I left the theater feeling worse than when i entered.Next, I have to preface this by saying I only watched the first half of the movie. Ill also add that I have never walked out of a movie theater and i would have walked out far earlier if I were by myself. Luckily i saw it for free so those idiots who made it will get no profit from me.I presume that this movie is meant to be a comedy yet in 45 minutes i did not even chuckle at the movie. I laughed at my friends face because it matched my own: Why are we subjecting ourselves to this? Crude humor can be funny, idiotic humor can be funny. Somehow Disaster Movie takes these kinds of humor to a lower level than I have ever seen. I have seen nearly all the other movies of this variety and they had some remote humor, this had none.I do not think hallucinogenic drugs could have salvaged this movie experience.I felt like someone should make a TV infomercial warning against these movies. Like the ones that tell kids not to smoke or say If you have mesothelioma you are entitled to monetary compensation, call this number for details. If I had possessed the materials I would have made a shirt to warn people constantly about this.Please do not see this movie. Although if you know someone you need to get back at tell them to see this.	1

A Movie That Made Me Cry	United States	I normally dont cry in movies. Forrest Gump, Big Fish, Schindlers List, and many others have passed before my eyes, and not a tear has been shed. I consider myself a lover of cinema, with an appreciation for the art of film. I love many genres, including comedy, action, and of course, zombie movies. All of this aside, I watched Disaster Movie this afternoon, and it elicited one emotion from me: Anger.I have never been so irritated in all of my adult life by a movie. I have watched these cretins put out all of this filth that masquerades as entertainment, and have held my tongue until now. I will say this right now: anyone who finds these movies entertaining should be ashamed of themselves. I generally believe that people can have whatever opinion they want, but people that actually like these movies are contributing to the downfall of the art form of cinema. By encouraging LionsGate to continue making these horrendous movies, all we are doing is perpetrating a cultural crime that we may never be able to fix. I grow weary of the multitudes who flock to theaters to see this garbage, and I weep for the future of our nation if this is what passes for entertainment these days.None of the jokes are funny. The parodies of films like Juno and 10,000 BC fail to amuse, and even the lampooning of unexplainable culture phenomena like Hannah Montana and Amy Winehouse is an exercise in futility. No one has ever tried to do more with fecal matter and farm animals than this movie did, and it failed miserably.I beg all of you, as a lover of movies, not to see this film. It is an absolute atrocity, and I guarantee you will feel stupider for having watched it.PS: I work at a theater, so the only reason I even saw this movie was for job purposes. I didnt pay to see it, and neither should you.	1
Someone please kill Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer	Ontario, Canada	If nobody does, I will. After the critically panned Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, these two assholes decide to make another. Its the same formula, they make fun of popular movies in a tired, unfunny fashion.I saw it with a few friends, hoping maybe I could get maybe one or two laughs out of it (I didnt expect anything). When I came out, I was seriously stunned at how lame the movie was. One friend actually liked it, all I had to say was, What have you been smoking lately?.Im not even going to bother explaining the plot, since there really isnt a plot at all. All I can say is, dont waste your money watching the film. It contains no genuinely funny humor and is one of the worst movies ever made. And everyone thought Meet the Spartans bad, wait until they get a load of this one.	1
100% Disaster !!	Qatar	Why i went to the midnight showing of this movie i dont know but i guess its better then buying a ticket to this movie. Honestly i cant say i have ever seen a movie as bad as this in my entire life. This movie makes gigli look like an OK movie. There isnt one funny moment in the entire movie it is basically all crappy acting mixed with crappy comedy. The only way you could possibly find this funny is if you are high or have an IQ lower then 30. Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectras acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it. I mean you would be way better off watching KIms sex tape cause at least its more entertaining then this movie. I highly advise everyone to not see this movie ever and try to get these to directors to never make another god awful movie again. Its kind of sad 2 grown men find this funny. PATHETIC	1
Dont even bother...	Canada	I just finished viewing Disaster movie on opening night. I came in with no expectations at all due to being tired of these spoof movies since Meet the Spartans, but I had to go in since I couldnt see Death Race. So when I was viewing this movie I really thought nothing could make me laugh. There were no character developments, there were no disaster movies spoofs(the only disaster things happening in the movie were meteors falling which were only 2 by the way). To tell you all the truth, I only chuckled once or twice(at the Juno parts). The rest of the jokes were either dumb, immature, or just recycled garbage from past movies.So to tell you all right now I have to say one thing about this movie: Dont see it, its no improvement from previous spoof mistakes.Rating: 1 out of 10	1
Who the hell says teens watch this?	United States	I wish this thing has a lower rating than one, this horrible excuse for a movie, deserves it over and over again. First off, these movies are NOT fueled by dumb teenagers foolish enough to watch them. Im 15 and even I know this is the biggest garbage ever. I dont watch these movies since Date Movie, because I learned right there that these movies suck. I went to a it with a friend and basically went to see how much it would suck. It sucked major ass. I walked out after a half-hour and hassled for my money back. When was the last time there even WAS a disaster movie? Juno, 10,000 B.C., Dont Mess With the Zohan, Indiana Jones, these are completely irrelevant, as are the hundreds of unfunny jokes ripped off the comedies they spoof (which is stupid as it is to spoof a comedy) and made them even less funny.Because of this movie, I will probably never watch MadTV again because it ruined my opinion of many of them. They give pathetic, poorly performed excuses for acting, and showed how horrendously unfunny they can be. (Its worse than when Tina Fey left SNL).If you want comedy, dont watch this, spoofing is an art, a talent few posses, and these two jack-weeds dont posses it AT ALL. If you want to see good comedy, go to the store and buy Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane!, Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, Scary Movie 3, and Superhero movie, because those movies are actually hilarious. Some less than others, but SM3 and SHM are far better than 10 Disaster Movies.So anyone who says that dumb adolescent teens fuel this garbage, think again because this stuff is garbage and I dont watch garbage. (this was an exception because people like my friend fuel this garbage :P.) This films will give you AIDS, makes you lose your hair, make you go blind, become flacid, makes you get a purple sock, this movie will destroy you and your sense of humor. Excuse the graphic descriptions, thats what it does to you, on the inside. DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IF YOU DONT WATCH THIS, THOSE DUMBASSES WONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS GARBAGE. THINK OF YOUR FUTURES! WHAT IF 80 MORE OF THESE FILMS ARE MADE WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AROUND. THINK OF YOUR CHILDREN, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!	1
Not worth the admission	United States	Went to see it with a friend at the spur of the moment. I havent seen the other movies of this kind besides the first two Scary Movies. We ended up being the two oldest people in the theater (21 and 22). While the masses of preteens behind us laughed hysterically at the minute long belch session, I was exchanging horrified glances with my friend. It was pretty terrible. If you took a bunch of 6th graders together and told them to put together a skit in about 5 minutes, it would probably look something like Disaster Movie. The only moment we laughed was the chipmunk scene. Seeing them head-banging just seemed hilarious at the time, maybe because everything else leading up to it had been so mind-numbingly terrible. Its not worth the price of admission. The was one good thing about the movie though. The night felt so anti-climactic after that film, that we decided to go to Atlantic City and had a blast.	1
Oh my god, this does not look at all good.	United Kingdom	Now, this is review is just based off of the trailer, but still. I saw the trailer when I went to see get smart. Which I liked. But anyway from the same lame brained idiots who brought Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans comes Disaster Movie. Whats wrong with this movie? For a spoof film to have no satirical content and just have footage of superheroes flying into walls and various other stupidity. And what the hell is up with the Juno and sex in the city bit? That is without a doubt the weirdest bit in movie history do you really think the woman who wrote Juno is going to see her characters baby kick a woman in the face and go, oh I got burned. Also whats with the bikini girls running away from meteors? Thats just kind of sexist.The plot is ridiculously thin its just people avoiding meteors. Theres less plot than in Pee Wees adventure where he just loses a bike. Aaron Selzter and Jason Freidberg had better stop making movies because they are just wanting money.	1
Brings a new meaning to Disaster Movie	Mexico	READ THIS BEFORE YOU CONSIDER WATCHING DISASTER MOVIE: DONT. JUST DONT.Since I dont live in USA, there is absolutely no possibility for me to run across Friedberg or Seltzer. Because if I ever did, I will throw them whatever heavy object I have at my grasp right to their faces.Believe me when I say this. There is no way this piece of garbage (sorry for the comparison, garbage) can have any shred of wit, creativity or thought.Do not honor it with your attendance at a theater where it is actually shown (even if you get a free admission).Why, do you ask? What does this movie have that can be so bad? Well, it has everything and nothing at the same time. It has all the references (not parodies) of every single movie you have paid good money to see lately. Not just that, they try to make fun of Juno, a movie whose script by Diablo Cody is light years ahead of Selter and Friedbergs, and The Dark Knight, a movie that redeems the famed franchise. Schumacher made a genius portrayal of the Dark Cruzader compared to what said idiots have done. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was better than this. The whole nuke the fridge scene was smarter than any scene in Disaster Movie.It doesnt have any real craftsmanship whatsoever. The only likeliness this thing had to film-making or production was the basic presence of a camera and people in front of it (not necessarily actors). The jokes? Thats the joke: There are no jokes. More and more references to celebrities and big movies. And the main thing Disaster Movie is missing in the plot is... you guessed it! A disaster! I personally thought Meet the Spartans was going to be the end of this Spoof Movie era. But they made Superhero Movie, and now, Seltzer and Friedberg are back! Ahhh! The humanity! An advice to producers outside the Spoof Movie circle. If you want your movie to become a success, mention that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had nothing to do with it. Youll make millions (the only ones who wont see it are pre-teens that have never seen any real movie, and paid to see Date, Epic, Spartans and Disaster). I wouldnt say you should avoid it like the plague, because the plague is funnier, more enjoyable and has a better thought script than Disaster Movie. It doesnt even deserve to be voted upon.	2
I cant believe Im saying this, but this is even worse than Meet the Spartans	Long Beach, California	The writing of this movie is truly inventive. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have figured out how to make movies with no plots, based on movies they have only seen the trailers to, and these movies have such low budgets, that they still make money. Even with the low budget, they have an all star cast, full of bad Madtv actors, Carmen Electra and even the legendary Tony Cox. The acting, writing and direction all sparkle like the latrines of a diarrhea filled bathroom. This movie might be on par with Schindler&#x27;s List for the amount of laughs, or there lack of. Honestly, though, this movie is one of the most god awful things ever made. Even their last all time low Meet the Spartans was topped in terms of horrible writing and direction, and the current rating of a 1.3 shows that Mr. Friedberg, Mr. Seltzer and their other writing partner Satan can&#x27;t get much worse.Disaster Movie...what a title for this, considering not one Disaster Movie is spoofed. Every movie here is one that came out within the last year, many which came out after this piece of garbage was written, and not one of them was a disaster movie. I guess they did a parody of Twister with the cow falling, but being the geniuses these two gems of writers are, they probably haven&#x27;t seen Twister and just thought it would be funny to have a cow crush Iron Man. I was practically wetting my pants with some of this material. The Hulk&#x27;s pants fall off, then he&#x27;s hit by a cow. Duh, haha, duh, that&#x27;s some good stuff. I think the target audience of this movie must be two year old mentally unstable children, and even they would find the humor a bit too dumb and immature.Onto the plot of this winner. Will (Matt Lanter) has a dream that he&#x27;s in 10,001 B.C. and he fights the Wolf from American Galdiators and meets Amy Winehouse who burps for like ten minutes on him, then gives him the Crystal Skull. He wakes up to find his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) is leaving him for Flava Flave and little man Jojo. He throws a super duper sweet sixteen, despite that he is 25, and then a High School Musical number goes on, and then Calvin (played by the wonderful G. Thang) tries to curve a bullet, then Carmen Electra gets in a battle with other beauty Kimberly Kardashian, then Junie sings, and then later Javier Bardem, Prince Caspian, Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf and a police officer are all played by Ike Barinholtz, and thousands of sub-plots and movie spoofs of every recent movie comes in.I must admit, I laughed more here than in Meet the Spartans. Meet the Spartans produced about .5 chuckles, where this in total produced maybe 1 chuckle out of stupidity. The laughs were obviously infrequent, considering there was only 1 in this 75 minute collage of badly reproduced movies. The acting is actually not too bad in comparison to Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie, but the overall enjoyment level of none was reduced to less than none. It&#x27;s sad movies like this could be made (let alone be called movies). This was the most awful putrid flick to ever appear on the big screen, and as long as it makes money, each year we will be treated to even worse movies from these swell writers and directors.Overall, this was not the best movie around, in fact, it was the worst. Avoid this at all costs. If it was a choice between this movie and death, it would be a tough choice.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 75 mins. PG-13 for stupid humor and poopoo mouth.	1
This movie actually made me angry...	Bay Area, California	Angry, in as so much as that I wasted my money, my time, and my intelligence. I could actually feel my brain cells die off while watching this atrocity. I would say that no one over the age of 11 should be let into this movie, but that would be an insult to 11 year olds. Dont bother to read for a synopsis, given that you would first need a plot in order to have a synopsis. Indeed, I think I have already put more thought and effort into writing this comment than those who wrote the movie put into the script; thats assuming there even WAS a script.I would give 0 stars, but I can only choose 1 as the lowest. Save your money... save your time... save YOURSELVES!!! Avoid this movie at all costs, and boycott anything else put out by these shameful creators.	1
Completely Horrible	United States	I went to the movies yesterday to see a movie. Unfortunately the movie I wanted to see wasnt showing. My ride had already left, so I figured that I should watch another. There werent that many available so I saw Disaster Movie.This movie is the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. It got to the point were I got a huge headache and completely mind numbed. I wanted to leave almost 5 times during the movies. The actors were horrible. I could play better roles handicapped and blind.This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I recommend you dont watch this movie at all. Youd be happier in the dark corner of your room by yourself while depressing music plays in the background.	1
Its been several months, and my review was inevitable...here goes...	United States	Jason Friedberg &#x26; Aaron Seltzer.I&#x27;m generally a defender of the mainstream, but these two....these two....They embody all that&#x27;s wrong with Hollywood, hell, with modern film in general. I hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films, they aren&#x27;t satirizing films THEY ARE REFERENCING films, they are not a mockery of crappy Hollywood excess, they are an EXAMPLE of it. It&#x27;s like if Michael Bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive CGI and explosions. To do a parody or satire, you must PROVIDE or Impersonate examples of your topic and MOCK them over specific flaws and contradictions, you don&#x27;t COPY them and change things by adding hip-hop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. It&#x27;s clear they haven&#x27;t even watched the films that are &#x27;parodied&#x27; here, in fact, several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting, thus making effective parodies of those films impossible, and imagine for a moment if &#x27;Hancock&#x27; or &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; were never made and they still included references to those films, would you still consider that &#x27;hip&#x27; and &#x27;relevant&#x27;?.And even IF, pray tell, these films were funny, they are still off-topic. 99% of all the &#x27;jokes&#x27; have nothing to do with Disaster Movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. FACT: You cannot parody something effectively if you don&#x27;t even mention it. Cut out the off-topic scenes from &#x27;Disaster Movie&#x27; for example, and you&#x27;ll only be left with 3, maybe 5 at the most, minutes of film, mostly credits. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s the funniest film in the world, if it doesn&#x27;t in some way deliver what it promises, I&#x27;m still not even gonna give it one star. If the titles were meant to be symbolic or something(like how &#x27;Dancing with Wolves&#x27; isn&#x27;t literally about dancing with wolves and Chris Ware&#x27;s &#x27;Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth&#x27; comic is about an adult with autism), it wouldn&#x27;t matter, but in this case, they specifically say what they are going to do, and then disappoint. And sure a lot of comedies have off-topic jokes, but NOT ONES THAT TAKE UP 98.9% OF THE WHOLE FILM! At least &#x27;Bio-Dome&#x27; actually took place in a Bio-Dome!So I apologize if you get off on being disappointed, sorry, but I&#x27;m not. I prefer to laugh when watching a comedy, or at least, have fun. And even worse, when they DO make actual parodies of something, they only do lame, obvious, predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively, if not more so. Oh, so Hannah Montanna&#x27;s a merchandising whore, WOW I didn&#x27;t know that!!! It&#x27;s like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parent&#x27;s are discussing politics by making political jokes, but who knows nothing about how politics work, so he just say&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;m a politician&#x27; and makes fart noises with his mouth. Is that cutting-edge and insightful satire? NO. But these idiots seem to think it is, because it&#x27;s basically what they do, only with &#x27;actors&#x27; doing it for them. My review for &#x27;Caltiki&#x27; is a better example of satire. And don&#x27;t call me a snob, because I&#x27;m a guy who loves stupid comedy, &#x27;Jingle all the Way&#x27; and &#x27;The Stupids&#x27; are some of my favorite guilty pleasures, hell, I started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because I dared question the audacity of &#x27;Mystery Science Theatre 3000&#x27; and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks &#x27;South Park&#x27; is a sign of the coming Apocalypse.So don&#x27;t blame other people&#x27;s films, these are crap all on their own.And if they intend their films to be that way, that just makes it even worse, so they intend to make off-topic, unfunny, parody-devoid, boring, unpleasant films? That just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. Even assassination attempts. And if they really do consider their films to be real parodies, then they are one-trick ponies, and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few tricks,(like the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars, or Dane Cook being juvenile and unoriginal, although yeah, he is) then these two are the one trick-iest one trick ponies who ever lived, and their only trick is being off-topic.These films aren&#x27;t even entertaining in a so bad it&#x27;s good way, in fact, they are the antithesis of entertainment. I usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film, as I used to think that that was impossible and although I&#x27;ve done so, it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired, drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. Well, it&#x27;s true, these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. In fact, if someone could have filmed me &#x27;watching&#x27; this garbage, I&#x27;m sure there would have been Z&#x27;s floating over my head.Ditch this crap, please.Oh, and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this, I&#x27;ll let you know I didn&#x27;t pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film. ~ The previous review will suffice for your Freidberg-Seltzer film of choice~	1
This Is Not The Worst Movie Of 2008. This Is The Worst Movie Ever.	United States	Disaster Movie is the 4th movie that has been made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, this spoofs many blockbuster movies and pop culture figures of recent years. This time, the focus is on the disaster theme similar to The Day After Tomorrow.Since 2006, Jason and Aaron, who first met while working on Scary Movie, usually release one movie every year. This is actually the second movie they released this year.This is actually the second movie they released this year. At the beginning of this year in January, they did Meet the Spartans, which opened at #1 and spoofed the entire script of 300. I saw that film and thought that it was going to be the worst movie of the year.After seeing this one, I can say Disaster Movie is quite possibly the worst movie ever. I mean, it really is the worst movie ever made and released. You can put it straight to DVD or Blu-ray, and it still wouldnt be funny. You can air it as a made-for-TV movie, and it still wouldnt be funny. You can make it into a TV show pilot, and it still wouldnt get picked up. You can even get MAD TV canceled by including this as one of their skits.What throws the whole movie is that the jokes are continuous every 4 seconds and never have any humor. Every time you think they will forget something, they end up spoofing it. They actually try to spoof every movie made this year. And they even try to include every TV character and celebrity in their jokes. It just doesnt amuse, and it just doesnt quit. They really have no idea of when to quit.But the real reason why the jokes arent funny is that its inaccurate, overused, and butchered poorly. They spoof High School Musical with the main characters, and they poorly spoof Gabriella as a cheerleader, which she never was. They spoof Kung Fu Panda, an animated movie, using a robot panda that looks like a panda in the real world. The performance they did with Alvin and the Chipmunks will give you so many nightmares, you would rather the 2007 version over this movie. The idea to use a male actor to play Carrie Bradshaw in the Sex & The City spoof is too desperate, too obvious, and worst of all, so wrong. And the other jokes used have been used already in their other movies, used already in other spoof movies, and are too old to even try and would have been used at the appropriate time.This movie doesnt even spoof disaster films in general, unless if you can find any real Cloverfield spoofs. Some of the spoofs arent actually in the movie and rather used as promotional ads. All they try to do is give many films and A-list Hollywood stars the roasting they deserve. In reality, they destroy the parody film genre again and with more damage that a lot of people would rather stop making fun of them in movies like this. Normally, you can actually expect a film parody to be declared the worst movie ever by many people. But I guarantee that there is not and will not ever be a movie as worse as this one.	1
Well, at least it lived up to its name, Disastrous Movie or is it Disaster Movie, whichever one fits.	United States	This year Jason and Aaron pull out another movie from their repertoire of steamy crap, and I quoted movie because this thing is barely a movie. When I think of a movie I think of something that has a plot and characters, but this is some kind of unknown piece of work. A razzie wont do this film justice. But at least the razzie people now know who to give the award to. So bad it almost makes the other ones seem good.PROS:I have nothing good to say about this film. Absolutely nothing. CONS: my favorite part of this comment. The cons. OK first of all Aaron and Jason need to look up the definition of spoof in the dictionary, the definition might vary from a dictionary to another, but I am pretty sure no dictionary will give the following definition, a piece of work in which various objects fall on pop culture icons and random stuff with no synchronized manner happens. If a dictionary gives that definition to the word spoof then i stand corrected. For me parody movies are taking a little amount of a pop culture reference and expanding upon it and making original jokes such as airplane and scary movie and all those other movies which Aaron and Jason should have learned from. In this film, however, the genre diverts from a parody to wackness.99% of the jokes in this movie are prolonged and at some point you feel like you are being tortured. And then the unbearable redundancy. As if the audience like the jokes they already made in the film, they make other ones in the same manner. Where one of three things happens, something falling on someone, or somebody being hit brutally and somehow make it through, or somebody starting a random dance-off. The scene I hated the most, not that I liked any, is the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin and the chipmunks show up, and for some reason start chewing on Junos character(named Juney). The scene was somewhat disturbing and rubbish. everything in this film is a rip off. 95% of the characters are ripped off. the jokes are all rip-offs and it almost looked like an unscripted reality show, you know, where people do random stuff cause its not scripted.FINAL THOUGHTS: The saddest part is that these guys are making a living like this, I mean come on, there are talented actors and directors out there who are dying for roles and these guys are making a living by writing a script that looked like it took two hours or less to complete? unbelievable.Another thing, What is wrong with us human beings these days? I mean some people were actually laughing hysterically during the film, and I thought of the film Idiocracy, where people find this kind of stuff funny. I look forward to hating the next movie they are going to bring. I really do.	1
Abysmal	United States	It was...I mean...I just dont know what I can say. Anyone with a soul knows this thing is worthless.If you like things you know getting hit by other things you may or may not know. Popular culture references that are often not even that timely. And production quality that is on par with community college theater. If all of that stuff is what makes a movie good for you, still, STILL, dont watch this. Because it fails at failure.And a word to people who are into bad movie self-punishment. Just rent Troll 2, no one but the renter makes any money. And it doesnt give a false positive that someone watched this on purpose.	1
Oversaturated and corny.	United States	It seems that this type of movie died after the Wayans brothers stopped making the Scary Movies. Those movies were funny and didnt try to squash 20 movies in that didnt fit or relate. Scary Movie 1 was about Scream and Scary movie 2 was about House on Hunted Hill. These other movies could have been good if done right but these ( Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Superhero Movie, and Disaster Movie ) were poorly executed, lazy, poorly written, and off topic.Distaster Movie could have been good if base off and idea in the genre like Twister,Cloverfield, or Day After Tomarrow. Also if it actually had funny and talented actors and writers.This movie only had one moment that made me laugh out loud just because I wasnt expecting it. That one moment was very brief as it was followed by Chucky Cheese like animatronic Chipmunks that ruined my one moment of joy in this cluster f of pop culture regurgitation that had no business being in the movie.I cant believe I paid to see this crap! After the movie I felt embarrassed and cheated.	1
A real disaster	United States	This movie was a real disaster. I cant remember the last time Ive been so disappointed to point of wanting a refund.Be warned,save your money. You may just want to wait until this movies airs on TV. I wouldnt recommend DVD either. A complete waste of money. You would think when they watched the finished project, that they realized then, we cant release this, it will not do well. I have no doubt this movie want be in theaters long. The local theater here is know for pulling movies that do not sale within the first three days of showing. The comedy in this movie was not good,it made no sense what so ever. The acting in some cases were very poorly executed.	1
Will Friedberg and Seltzer ever learn? I knew this was going to be horrible.	Kennesaw, GA	The only good thing about this movie is that it spoofs both High School Musical and Hannah Montana, two things which feel so out of character for Disney and two things that I just dont like, basically because both franchises are directed towards girls. Which is better? Movies that you dont like or really bad movies? Its hard to tell, because really bad movies are bad on their own. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be fired after making 4 bad movies in one career. At this rate theyll probably surpass Ed Wood for the most bad movies made by certain people or a single person. These guys just dont learn. All four movies they made: Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and this are all unfunny. Kids and teenagers are seeing this because of the commercials advertising this movie. I recommend you not going to see it and the agony booth recap for Epic Movie is funnier than this. It is located here: http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/Epic_Movie_2007.aspx Man, they should stop this crap now! Weve seen too many unfunny spoof movies already.	1
What a waste	United States	Actually, a minus 10 would be more Apropro. THE worst asinine, most stupid movie I have ever seen. Wish I could get my money back! I will be sure to make note of the directors and will not put myself through the torture of watching another of their movies. You want ten lines? Ill give you ten lines....stupid, asinine, ignorant, gross, humorless, incongruent, plot less, objectionable, senseless, dopey, waste of time, waste of money, ripoff, fake, poor acting, more fun to watch grass grow, more fun to watch paint dry, so loud, you might as well leave your cell phone on.. as you couldnt hear it anyway. Maybe you get the point.. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even my enemies.	1
Parody is dead	United States	Once again that talentless duo that is Selzer and Friedberg show that they can sink lower than Meet The Spartans with this steaming waste of celluloid. I thought that Meet The Spartans scraped the barrel when it came to laughs but this cinematic abortion breaks through the bottom of the barrel to scrape the ground the barrel is on to get laughs and it still fails! These two chuckleheads still have the same bad habit of explaining the jokes to you as if you were retarded(if you liked this movie chances are you probably are retarded). For example if you have to explain to us what it is you&#x27;re making fun of like &#x22;Its an inconvenient truth, its global warming&#x22;, &#x22;Come here you Kung Fu Panda&#x22;, &#x22; I know because I saw Indiana Jones and The Kingdom Of the Crystal Skull&#x22;, &#x22;Let Me get my Get Smart phone&#x22;, &#x22; I thought I&#x27;d cheer you up with a high school musical&#x22;, What is this enchanted place&#x22; then you&#x27;re not really a genius but a racketeer that got by on the sheer stupidity of the average movie going public.You know for a movie titled Disaster movie, you would think that they&#x27;d be spoofing movies like Twister, Dante&#x27;s Peak, Volcano, The Day After Tomorrow right? WRONG. The camera shakes a couple of times, You see some cheesy plastic asteroids, a couple of cows floating around and a very crummy CGI tornado. The movie targets films like Juno, Alvin and The Chipmunks, Superbad, High School Musical, Step Up, Enchanted, Kung Fu Panda, The Dark Knight and a slew of other summer blockbuster flicks including, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk and Hancock. Now tell me, what do these movies have to do with disaster movies? Nothing.Nobody in this movie does anything that resembles acting and its safe to say that this &#x22;movie&#x22; is 100% laugh free. None of the &#x22;jokes&#x22; work and they just drag on for minutes at a time. Seltzer and Freidberg are unfunny hacks that killed a once funny genre with their grave dead brand of humor. If you want a good parody stick with Scary Movie(the first one), Top Secret, Duck Soup, Johnny Dangerously, Airplane, Not Another Teen Movie, Mafia!, Baseketball, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, Spaced Invades, Hot Shots(part one and Part Deux), The Naked Gun Series, Don&#x27;t Be A Menace, Im Gonna Git You Sucka, Last Action Hero(yeah, I said it), UHF, CB4, Hollywood Shuffle, Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid and every other spoof that came before the advent of Scary Movie 3. Disaster Movie is complete and utter garbage that even those brainless yokels that come on Jerry Springer wouldn&#x27;t find funny(yes, its THAT bad). Do not waste another dollar on these idiotic circus clowns (Seltzer and Freidberg)and their lame parodies. To the people that gave this movie positive reviews, pat yourselves on the back. You are responsible for the decline of quality in American Cinema. Parody is dead and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Freidberg are the undertakers.Rest in Peace Parody 1933-2008	1
The Perfect Title	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	In general, parody movies are entertaining and recommended when the viewer is upset, expecting to shutdown the brain and laugh with silly jokes. That was my expectation with when I selected Disaster Movie on DVD this Friday. Unfortunately this flick is AWFUL and I was incapable of laughing during the long 88 minutes running time. With the due respect the retards deserve, the directors and writers of this crap certainly have mental or education issues (or both), and I can not imagine how someone sane can produce and put money in this terrible production. The only thing that works perfectly is the original title of this disastrous flick. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Super-Her&oacute;is, A Liga da Injusti&ccedil;a (Superheroes, The League of the Injustice)	1
Spoof? I think not.	United States	I dont think Ive ever seen a worst piece of mindless drivel in my entire life. I liked the Scary Movie films, dont get me wrong. They had some intelligent jokes, and left you to wonder which movie they were spoofing. Then came the outright spoof films: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Superhero Movie, Epic Movie, etc. They started making fun of films far more popular and far more creative then they could ever hope to be. The movie is full of Mad TV rejects and dropouts that the writers/directors have given sub-par jokes/gags to. The bottom line is this movie is an insult to your intelligence, and an insult to the movies they spoof. I think that Failburg and Seltzerwater (I personally like their name change, thanks to another writer on here) need to go back and watch some real spoof movies like Space Balls, or Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail, even Robin Hood: Men In Tights or Naked Gun. I will tell you this, I walked out of the movie after about 30 minutes. I got tired of seeing movies that were clearly better than any of the movies by these two jokers will ever be get dragged through the dirt with stupid, ill-written, badly performed, mindless comedy. Its clear that the writers and directors of this movie have severe ADD and have an IQ of about 30, which is what youll need to actually enjoy this movie. Please avoid this movie at all cost, it only perpetuates the myth that Failburg and Seltzerwater are actually funny.	1
As you might expect, terrible.	United States	It would be easy for someone to point fingers at this movie and say it would be terrible even before the trailer came out based on the fact that it was done by those two guys who made such crapshoots as Date Movie, Epic Movie, and the latest, Meet the Spartans. Then the trailer came out, giving us more of a reason to hate it.And as you might expect, it was terrible. I think my reasoning for seeing this movie was because I had nothing else to do and I wanted something to make fun of. This movie is so frustratingly bad that you really dont feel a desire to make fun of it. It doesnt deserve it. There is clever funny, there is stupid funny, and there is ridiculous funny. This movie just isnt funny. It is just annoying. It just parodies the summers movies in a way that is just annoying. Iron Man, Indiana Jones, whatever. It wasnt funny.Just stay away. You probably already knew that but if you feel like you have nothing else to do as I did, trust me, staring at a wall is better. You will come out angry and upset that anyone would actually be stupid enough to make a film this atrocious.	1
why? just why	new york city	why bother another one another one please stop why cant these people give it a break and why Hollywood just stop making movies period if were going to have an other one why cant they be a good director as the other directors out there Im surprised these guys even get lay ed. this movie will be forgotten right away after this 2 weeks why would they do this to them self are u going to show Ur kids that this what u made in Ur time Ur wrong they will hate u and they will never make friend cause of this this they did anything to put in 90 minutes but why. i feel like throwing up it would be better then watching this movie again please dont watch this movie the title says it all for crying out loud. stop this please dont even buy the DVD u people suck	1
A crime against humanity	United States	Anyone who supports the creation of the intellectual equivalent of sewage by paying to see this movie should be charged with a crime against humanity. Freedom of speech and all, but theres no redeeming quality to these films.I dont know why IMDb requires 10 lines of text to post a comment. I really said all I needed to say in the first paragraph. And everybodys said the same thing here - that these movies arent even parodies. Theyre regurgitations. Of course, all of us here know that, so it must be a different audience who keeps going. If its young uns who are going, I may need to consider moving to another country before they reach adulthood. Of course, they could scarcely do worse steering our country than the 50.1% of Americans who returned W. to office in 2004. Put those two phenomena together (the last 8 years and the popularity of these films) and I think we can officially call it sunset on the American Empire. Seriously. These movies are that bad. They shine light on the barren wasteland that is the interior of our populaces skulls.	1
Really, Who Gives A F**k	None	That&#x27;s probably what the directors said when making this movie, though that should come as no surprise to anyone at this point. Once again Friedberg and Seltzer have teamed up to drive countless moviegoers to suicide with a new cinematic monstrosity the likes of which haven&#x27;t been seen since The Garbage Pail Kids Movie.The acting is terrible. I have no idea who any of these actors are (I refuse to acknowledge Kim Kardashian as an actress after all the awful things SHE&#x27;S put out) but pretty much any hope they&#x27;ve ever had of a career was more or less destroyed by this movie. I&#x27;m still baffled that Tim Curry managed to survive Scary Movie 2.The plot... There is no plot. There is no story. There is no CONFLICT. It&#x27;s just a group of stupid kids going around ripping off every single movie made in recent years (at the time of its release) while tornadoes and other disasters strike the area.I wish a tornado had struck this movie during production...And remember how previous Seltzer and Friedberg movies had &#x22;parodied&#x22; genre films (if you&#x27;re using the definition of someone who doesn&#x27;t know what parody is)that they were named after? Of course not, seeing as like me you&#x27;ve tried to pretend these movies never existed up to this point, but humor me on this. The title itself is a complete lie, holding no ties to the genre from which it takes its name other than being a complete disaster in and of itself.Consider this my review for ALL Seltzer and Friedberg movies: they&#x27;re all a huge pile of cinematic fodder that should be cremated, buried and forgotten and their creators kicked out of Planet Earth.	1
Never has a movie had a More Appropriate Title!	United Kingdom	Having seen the Scary Movie Series and many of the other works by this group of stars and Directors, my hopes for laughs were low...But even i could not have predicted how bad this really would be...Within the first 10 Minutes, we see possibly the WORST Amy Winehouse Look Alike EVER in one of the most UNFUNNY Movie Moments ever created... I was never a fan of Miss Winehouse, but dear god - How could anyone find this parody of her even remotely funny?It seems that the Directors have now reached a pinnacle since the first ideas they ever had... Scary Movie was Rude and Crude and Broke Barriers - It was funny...... Where this movie is like Epic Movie, Just plain CRUDE! So Crude that it is NOT FUNNY - END OF!I watched it simply because it was on the TV... I am damn glad I never saw it at the Cinema or wasted my money buying the DVD...There is an ART to doing PARODY... Being Crude is Great but only if you can do so with Intellect...These people need to take a step back and look at the works of the Wonderful Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder and many more... They may be old and their humour may not match the new generation, but they had a class that made it work and made it funny!Face it Fellas... You have no class... And trying to be crude when you have no class means you are just plain crude... And that means you FAIL!How would I rate this Movie? Sadly, We cannot do Minus ratings... So My honest view is I don&#x27;t... Not even ONE STAR... But to submit my review I need to add one... And thats all it is getting!	1
This movie is a full crime.	South Korea	My friend said &#x27;never watch this movie. It sucks it hurts your eyes and it&#x27;s bad for your brain&#x27;. He said this movie was the second worst film he ever saw. Because of the fact that my friend watched like thousands of films, I was a little afraid to watch this movie. Unfortunately, My curiosity won my worries. After I decided to watch this movie, my friend told me about a hundred times not to watch this movie. But I was to curios. Then last Sunday while my friend was watching the Simpson, I watched this film. Before I start this review, let&#x27;s go over some types of movies. The first one is a movie that&#x27;s so good, you can hardly say anything after you watched it. Second: great, but not as good as the first one. Third: just good, forth: harmless, fifth: bad, sixth: very bad, seventh: a trash, and the last type: a movie that is used for torturing. This movie is used for the worst torture the humans has ever made.I should have listen to my friend. This movie was a total disaster. I should have known that when I saw the title. This movie starts with some not-funny slapstick and a Cristal skull.(Yeah I know it sounds familiar but let&#x27;s just go through it). It&#x27;s something about &#x27;if you don&#x27;t place the Cristal skull back in it&#x27;s place then the world will come to an end&#x27;. Yeah really great plot. Let&#x27;s give a medal for it. So anyway, this person name Will breaks up with his girlfriend and celebrates his sixteen year-old party....... even though he&#x27;s not. Here, High School Musical comes out of nowhere and it&#x27;s worst than the original. Think about it, worst version of high school musical. Than the story suddenly turns into save Will&#x27;s girlfriend and Will meet&#x27;s all kinds of characters. Here comes some great shocks like BATMAN IS FLEEING, CARRYING A SUITCASE. I am dead serious batman is fleeing, carrying a suitcase. Not satisfied? How about this? Ironman and Hulk gets defeated by a cow and so does Hellboy. Juno gets killed by Elvin and the chipmunks who are really monsters, Kung Fu Panda is a man wearing a mask, Hancok is some guy drinking, Giselle is eating glass bottles, and Indiana Jones is an old man who is really really short. There are some other characters but I don&#x27;t want to talk about them right now. No don&#x27;t cry yet, because there is one last thing: a song on the last scene. Which is a song that I like to call f**k song. I&#x27;m not giving this name because the song is bad. I&#x27;m giving this name because THE SONG IS ABOUT F**KING. I&#x27;m not lying. There is a song like this. This song is.........terribly horribly, horridly, disastrously, painfully, sickly, awful. I&#x27;ll tell you this. Batman is playing the guitar. Okay? I repeat, Batman is playing the guitar.Maybe there is a bad movie that you should watch or maybe there is a movie that&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s funny. But this film is not one of those films it cannot be one of those films. My friend caught a cold right after he saw this movie and so have I. This movie is just.........awful. No, awful isn&#x27;t the right word. There is not word in this whole universe that can describe this movie. Don&#x27;t watch this it&#x27;s bad for your brain, your eyes, your ears, your mind, and yourself.	1
Whoever gave this film the green light...should be arrested	United States	because he actually got the red light and thought it was green.See what happens when you democratize a medium and make it available to everyone. I mean, give someone a bunch of 35mm film stock, a Panavision camera and 25 million bucks, some hot chicks and dorky guys and they think that they can make a movie.Movies like this are good though!Because they can&#x27;t get any worse! And set the Jerry Springer crap bar even lower.The plot is as thin as Kate Moss and the brain dead humor is lifeless even with real people saying the lines.Just think, 25 million dollars could have: saved some turtles, fed some people, provided shelter for others, helped Red Cross, built houses in New Orleans, kept in the bank to load out to people needing money, provided 25 good filmmakers with a million bucks each, kept Leslie Nelson alive for a few more years, and could provide a dollar each for some 25 million people.	1
Please, burn this	United States	This movie falls into the very rare category of films that are an example of &#x22;what NOT to do.&#x22; The plot is 100% muddled (makes no sense whatsoever). Try to imagine an episode of Family Guy with no plot, just one incomprehensible comedy clip after the other--that is Disaster Movie in a nutshell.The only question is &#x22;Do you want the aspirin before or after you see this?&#x22; Please take my advice and don&#x27;t keep watching hoping it will get better -- it won&#x27;t! Just save your brain cells for a night of binge drinking or heavy metal music. Damaging your brain on those will be less painful. I hope everyone who saw it in the theater walked out and demanded a refund.Yes, it&#x27;s that bad...I can&#x27;t even think of how to describe it...I just watched it and my head hurts so bad I have to cut this review short to get aspirin...later.	1
Poor	Australia	horrendous!!! I didn&#x27;t laugh once during the entire movie. Save yourself 80 minutes! Give it a miss. Sadly I have to make up 10 lines about this movie. The movie does not deserve 10 lines but here we go anyway. I watched the superhero movie and that was funny, this was just not even worth a chuckle. I found this movie disjointed and it just basically struggled. I would be interested to know if anyone found it remotely funny. I gave it a 1, but it should be minus 10. I first saw the unbelievably hot Vanessa Minnillo in the TV show &#x22;True Beauty&#x22; and thought that she was pretty good in that. It is hard to believe that she went from the host of a TV reality show giving a good performance and then blew her credibility out the window by actually agreeing to participate in this garbage. I knew that this movie was going to blow by the four minute mark but I persisted with it hoping that it would get better or I would get a chuckle every now and then - but no - FAIL!!! The most ironic part of my day was that i watched a movie called Harpies - and that was worse! I think I have pi**ed Karma off, and I don&#x27;t know what I have done wrong!! ha ha ha	1
Why.....?	United States	I had been almost certain that this was going to be better than &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22; but after I watched this, I actually thought about watching Meet the Spartans again. This movie was an EPIC fail! I don&#x27;t know what gives people the idea that we actually want MORE of these types of movies. They all pretty much fail. Scary Movie was entertaining but once they had made things such as Date Movie and Epic Movie, It all began to suck! I read though other comments and I saw a majority of people agreeing that this movie blows! I would NEVER even think about THINKING to recommend this movie to another person. Even taking the time to look at the back of the DVD case would be a waste of time! In conclusion of my review, I recommend that NO ONE picks up this movie. I don&#x27;t think even an 8 year-old could find any enjoyment of this film. ***DON&#x27;T WATCH IT!***	1
Havent we seen this sort of film 1479 times already?!  And, it was funnier the other 1478 times.	Bradenton, Florida	This film begins in 100001 BC and we see a caveman fall into a pile of Wooly Mammoth crap. Then, he&#x27;s attacked by a guy who looks like he&#x27;s from &#x22;American Gladiators&#x22; and then an Amy Winehouse look-a-like with fangs. Then he awakens and a Flavor Flav lookalike is in bed with him and his girlfriend in the present. Shortly after this, a dwarf exits the bed and gives the leading man the finger. While parody is supposed to be silly, these images are so random you wonder if the film was written or they just too darts and threw them at story ideas--all very, very fast and all which fell completely flat--and many of which were just very, very crude to hide that it wasn&#x27;t funny. And this, in a nutshell, is what follows for the next 90 or so minutes--one supposed parody after another after another--none of which made me laugh.Here are my suggestions should they want to make another &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; or something like it: 1. Less jokes and slow down so you have time to work out the parodies. Quantity is NOT better than quality. Yet, at other times, unfunny skits go on and on and on and on and they had neither quantity nor quality. The Hannah Montana and &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; bits were beaten like dead horses.2. Hire professional writers, not squirrels. I know they work cheap, but humor is NOT their forte.3. Jokes about performing abortions with coat hangers aren&#x27;t funny. The film DID this and I am sure the entire theater when deadly silent. Like cancer and 9-11, this is NOT a good topic for comedy.4. Jokes involving dwarfs can work, but generally not. Unless you can get Mini-Me, don&#x27;t bother.5. Find talented actors and people who really can do parodies. It would also help if they vaguely look like the subject of the parody. Some did, many did not (like Hannah Montana).6. &#x22;I just s#%$ myself&#x22; is not a particularly funny line. Avoid it.7. Same goes for &#x22;suck on my placenta&#x22;. Not funny.8. Keep the &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; stuff--it&#x27;s not great but compared to the rest of the film, it&#x27;s gold. Just shorten it A LOT--this skit went on way too long and became 100% stupid. In fact, it was only funny for about 30 seconds. 9. If you&#x27;re gonna use a lot of actors from &#x22;Mad TV&#x22;, try to get the more talented ones.10. No poop jokes. Poop is not comedy gold. Poop is just poop.11. No &#x22;Kunk Fu Panda&#x22;. No.12. Get rid of Alvin and the Chipmunks unless you are willing to spend more than $13 for the puppets.13. Keep Beowulf--one of the only funny characters in the film who stayed funny throughout. He came late in the movie, though, and by then I am sure most of the patrons left the theater or killed themselves.14. And, speaking of kill--kill the director, producers, writers and all the actors. I&#x27;m not sure if this is legal, but I assume most judges and juries would allow this if they saw the film.	1
Worst movie of the decade,worst parody movie ever.	Canada	Wow...well i saw this movie not too long ago and its hard to imagine someone actually finding the strength to hold in all they&#x27;re anger after spending even a penny on this piece of royal crap,I at first had no idea what to expect from this i thought it was going to be another parody film but this time about i guess disaster movies like maybe twister,volcano, or maybe &#x27;the day after tomorrow&#x27; or something but instead all we saw where a bunch of seriously disastrous attempts to make humour out of some of 2008&#x27;s best movie events like dark knight and Indiana Jones,and randomly Alvin and the chimp mucks..okkk,the entire movie was pointless and the protagonists where boring as hell,and at some times looked as though they knew they were committing a crime for being soo bad but tried anyways to make the audience laugh but then fail again and make me twice as angry.I don&#x27;t personally know anyone else who saw this movie except the people i was with when i saw it,but i never actually talked face to face with anyone else about it and i have no questions as to why,this movie should never have been in theatres or even directed at-all,other then maybe in someones basement on a cheap webcam by a guy who had nothing else to do and was probably high!...then erased	1
Worst Movie Ever!	Canada	Easily the worst movie of all time! Not much more can be said. I can&#x27;t even begin to understand how any sort of time or effort was put forth into making this film a reality. Every joke was fail and absolutely nothing about this movie made me laugh in the slightest.I will never get this time back, but what bothers me more than that is the fact that I could have used my own hand-held camera to make something better than this. Hell give me a 1000 budget I could make something 10x better than this absolutely disgusting piece of trash.Anybody who reads this view on the movie or any others similar don&#x27;t even take a peek at this movie to see if it really is this bad. Just take peoples word for it and do something better with your life. I personally would have rather endured episodes of Barney and Friends.	1
Id thought Id never see the day when Id see something worse than Home Alone 4, but with this monstrosity, it just goes to show how much I could be proved wrong.	United Kingdom	Disaster Movie gets my vote as the &#x22;new&#x22; worst movie ever made, and there have been abominations like Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat and NeverEnding Story 3, but none of them are as terrible as this, and that is saying something. I thought Disaster Movie crude, lazy and looming towards offensive, (what they said about Amy Winehouse was bang out of order) and some of the repeated gags wore well thin before the first attempt was finished. The script was laughable, the writers display no comedic talent and there is a complete lack of laughs, and I am sorry I found the characters very annoying, Giselle especially. The acting was terrible, in all my life, I have never seen such terrible acting, and believe me, I have seen a lot of films with terrible acting. Matt Lanter and Vanessa Minillo were not only given next to nothing to work with, likewise with Tony Cox, but their performances went nowhere. Everyone else was bad too, especially Carmen Electra, whose career I am surprised isn&#x27;t over yet, in every film she&#x27;s in, she shows a complete lack of acting ability. The film looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, and even the soundtrack was awful. Plus the title was completely irrelevant, very rarely did it spoof a disaster movie, all it did was try and be funny and failed miserably. Not even the characters spoofed here like Batman, the Chipmumks(a gross ditortion in character and more disturbing than cute and funny) and Hellboy could save this contemptible piece of excrement(I am trying to refrain from swearing, honestly I was seriously considering turning the DVD player off 20 minutes into the movie). My dad and brother told me it was very stupid, but unlike them, I am 17 by the way, I didn&#x27;t find it entertaining in the least bit. If you want a good spoof try the silly but otherwise hilarious Loaded Weapon 1! Avoid this thing at all costs! I rest my case, 0/10. Bethany Cox	1
An Honest Review....	Canada	Anyone going into this film would automatically assume it would suck. The other films in the ______ Movie franchise have been garbage. Ladies and gentlemen, Disaster Movie is different.The film is so funny and spot on with the spoofs that I almost died from laughter. All the actors turn in near perfect parodies of their characters. I actually thought I was watching Juno and her baby fight Sarah Jessica Parker from Sex And The City. The guy who played Hancock could be a twin for Will Smith, that is how good he is. He channel the Hancock character so well that I thought I was watching the Hancock sequel.The film is so witty and on the spot with it&#x27;s comedy, it feels natural. So natural that there probably was no script. With a film like this, the joke write themselves. Throw whatever story you want in because it&#x27;s the comedy here that works. On second thought, the story works too. It&#x27;s leap and bounds over films that have been Oscar nominated. The story centre&#x27;s around these people and a crystal skull and some disaster that happens. Everything about it works.The fight scenes are phenomenal. G. Thang plays a character called Calvin, he has a fight scene with a real life panda. Or at least I thought it was a real life panda, the animatronics and special effects in this film will rival Avatar, and it came out a year before it!!! Take that James Cameron. The fight between the two is so well choreographed that it makes Jackie Chan and his stunts look like child&#x27;s play.The film has so many unexpected events. Who knew that a meteorite would come crashing down on Kim Kardashian. I sure didn&#x27;t. Speaking of Kim, she is more than just another pretty face. She was channeling something else here, I think she must have been in character for months before and after this film, because it is just too phenomenal. Daniel Day Lewis should be offering her his Oscar, that&#x27;s how good she is.Ike Barinholtz, of MADtv fame, pulls an Eddie Murphy and a Mike Myers, by playing multiple roles. His range is out of this world. Who else could be able to pull off Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf, a police officer and Javier Bardem look a like, and Prince Caspian. I can only think of one man...and that is Ike Barniholtz.I can&#x27;t stop recommending this film. It&#x27;s what the movies and film and cinema is all about. I wish I could watch it everyday for the rest of my life. Which is why I&#x27;m giving this the absolute best rating I can possibly give a film like this.	1
I Lost Almost 90 Minutes Of My life...	Bulgaria	Very few laughs, bad acting, writing and directing-what else can I say-I know that was actually the director&#x27;s goal, but that sick?! Every time when a movie like this comes out, a &#x22;.... Movie&#x22; I watch it, but I don&#x27;t know why anymore-Epic Movie was fine most of the time, had it&#x27;s laughs, Date Movie wasn&#x27;t even half as good as Epic, but this... huh, maybe it&#x27;s the right time to stop-the success of the Scary Movie franchise was big, but here I can&#x27;t see the fun anymore-I watched it, despite the fact I didn&#x27;t want to, and I felt sorry.I felt sorry for me, for the cast and crew and even for the director, who&#x27;s winning, I don&#x27;t know, maybe 3 or 4 times in a row the worst director of the year award.The movie isn&#x27;t capable of delivering the laughs, and this means all is lost, because those movies were all about them-the plot is...well there isn&#x27;t one, because they&#x27;re parodies and there&#x27;s nothing left...The last 10-15 minutes weren&#x27;t that bad, but that&#x27;s all(by not that bad I mean 4-5/10 not more), everything else was crappy and garbage.2/10 for those few minutes and for a couple of decent laughs.	2
Overindulgent, sophomoronic, throwaway crap.	United Kingdom	Something rather peculiar happened today whilst watching the third (yes, count em, third) lethargic spoof movie of this year alone; something bizarre and surreal, and quite unlike anything that I have experienced before: I didnt laugh. Yes, thats right, no once, not a guffaw, not a smirk, smile or one instantaneous moment of amusement; nothing but agonising pain soared through my bones when watching this production line slice of spoof comedy regurgitated on screen from the liquefied brains of hack writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Spearheaded with tired, overdone writing; predictably crass, shallow characters; a meaningless, lobotomised plot; mundane dialogue; dull, lazy, downright childish humour; lacklustre performances and the production value of a shoestring, Disaster Movie did eventually manage to provoke one moment of joy; when it was all over and I realised I could go home, far far away from the evil torture that had just unfolded in front of me.Like its inept predecessors, this latest offering from dud-duo Friedberg and Seltzer has the writers rummaging through all of this years biggest movies in search of something, no, anything to poke fun at in a demeaning manner as if these two actually know what theyre talking about. From Iron Man to Sex and the City, Juno to 10,000BC, Disaster Movie takes time to incorporate a lot of titles into its murky waters to try and get a laugh from someone, no, anyone, and its this transparent, kitschy appeal that eventually leaves the movie feeling lacking any value or substance. The saddest thing about the feature however lies in scenes where the writers go out of their way to directly and overtly mock several movies, yet in doing so end up making more of a mocking statement about themselves than of their targets.This misstep most firmly resonates during the many instances where Diablo Codys Juno script is called into question by the writers, spoofing its quirky, culturally referential dialogue and trying to pass it on as pretentious and overwritten of all things. Of course, instead of achieving what any decent spoof does in managing to make you laugh at a movie even if you enjoyed it, Disaster Movie instead only achieves in demeaning itself to point of embarrassment. Throughout the feature I couldnt help but feel that maybe if Jason and Aaron spent as much time on their script as Diablo obviously did, then maybe, just maybe theyd manage to make people laugh rather than ask for their money back. The writers try to create laugh out loud parody, and they seem to think theyre pretty good at it too, but, much like a bloated star, Disaster Movie ends up collapsing into itself under its own gravitational pull of overindulgent, sophomoronic, throwaway crap, resulting in a black hole void of any light, or signs of life.Of all the forms of comedy, the spoof is probably the easiest way in which to deliver a joke; its stand-up comedy on the big screen, joke after joke with little reliance on substantial narrative. So it goes without saying that even with such misgivings for any sort of coherent, well thought-out plot, and lacking any compelling, memorable characters whatsoever, as far as dumb spoof movies go, it should still be able to make you laugh regardless. Yet even here the movie goes in the completely wrong direction. Friedberg and Seltzers earlier effort this year was similar; it was stupid and inept at telling any sort of meaningful tale, but it at least delivered some moments of laughter. Here however we have references slapped in lazily, all of which feel suspiciously like theyve be written up after having seen the trailer, and not the full movie; there are no moments of relevancy and the writing constantly feels lazy and unremarkably indistinct from everything else. Often jokes will be dragged on and on incessantly and infuriatingly to the point where the initial disappointment of another bum-note turns into a cacophony of middling annoyance. Take for example an early jab at Hannah Montana (I wonder if anyone who goes to see this will have even seen her movie), as it is presented once, repeated again, and again and again; it isnt funny the first time and it certainly doesnt get any better from there on in. Then theres the same formula used with slapstick violence, and a caricature Amy Winehouse burping over and over like its meant to be hilarious. No, it really isnt.Often I will find it hard to adequately review a comedy movie simply due to the fact that humour is one of the most subjective forms of entertainment there is. Yet leaving Disaster Movie and overhearing comments of how it was alright followed by the brave conclusions of but, it wasnt very funny, I knew I wasnt alone. Indeed I would be surprised to find even the most immature, brain-dead of audiences enjoying this; I laughed at Superhero Movie, I laughed at Meet the Spartans&#133; hell, I think I even cracked a smile during Epic Movie, but I didnt do anything during Disaster Movie. Theres something to be said about a comedy that doesnt even raise one moment of laughter, never mind a spoof movie such as this which puts all of its chips on the line just to deliver the jokes. A perfect example of the market having a greater say over substance, Disaster Movie is a disaster, and the biggest catastrophe of the year.- Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)	1
I now know I had a soul, for I felt it die...	United States	This movie, along with Epic Movie, Date Movie, and Meet the Spartans, are pure trash. I love bad movies like Plan 9 and Manos, but they are not merely bad. They are cinematic abortions. These movies dont seem to be even trying to amuse me. It feels like theyre personally insulting me.On a side note, a previous comment stated that this movie is on par with Schindlers List in laughs. That is a lie. Schindlers List, while a serious and tragic film, had some funny parts. For example, the scene where Oscar Schindler is looking for a secretary. Each secretary is more attractive and a worse typist than the last, and Oscar (a notorious womanizer) keeps leaning in more and more. Then it cuts to a homely woman typing really fast and Oscar leaning as far away as possible. So he hires all of them. That is funny.If you had to list a movie on par with Disaster Movie in terms of laughs per movie, I would compare it to Salo: or The 120 Days of Sodom. However, Salo, disturbing as it is, is art with social messages. This Epically Disastrous Spartan Date franchise has no redemptive properties whatsoever.	1
Disaster Movie Is A Disaster!	United States	Disaster Movie lives up to its title. The latest lowbrow movie lampoon from the writing and directing duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer qualifies as their least imaginative burlesque of blockbuster movies. Friedberg and Seltzer contributed jokes for the last two Scary Movies. Afterward, they ventured out on their own and their first and third spoofs Date Movie (2006) and Meet the Spartans (2008) fared better than their lamentable sophomore effort Epic Movie(2007). The theatrical movie poster shows a tidal wave swamping the Statue of Liberty. Nothing as large-scale as a tidal wave engulfs Disaster Movie. When the earthquake strikes, Friedberg and Seltzer do little more than wobble their cameras to simulate cataclysmic events.The best Friedberg & Seltzer parodies single out a specific movie and flesh out the fun with gags from other movies that have nothing to do with the narrative. Date Movie, for example, ribbed the romantic Will Smith comedy Hitch, while Meet the Spartans skewered the homoerotic spear & sandal saga 300. Ostensibly, Disaster Movie appropriates the Cloverfield plot, but omits everything else plot that distinguished Cloverfield. Disaster Movie doesnt consist of first-person video footage recovered from a camcorder. Friedberg & Seltzer have no Godzilla-type monster trampling the city. The humor consists of diametrically opposite characters colliding with each other as mobs of panic-stricken people swarm the streets amid chaos. Sexual and scatological jokes brimming with PG-13 profanity and partial male nudity seem rather tame because after four movies bowel noises lack hilarity.Disaster Movie opens with a dream. The protagonist, Will (Matt Lanter of Heroes), dreams that the year is 10,001 B.C. This is a clear reference to the prehistoric potboiler 10,000 B.C. Will imagines that he is a caveman with dreadlocks and a rampaging dinosaur is chasing him. Our hero dodges a gigantic dinosaur foot as it pulverizes the ground nearby. Instead, he plunges headlong into a pile of dino poop. Afterward, he encounters a saber-toothed, alcoholic Amy Winehouse (Nicole Porter of Mad TV) with her bizarre beehive hairdo. Winehouse conjures up a Mac laptop from her beehive. She forecasts the end of the world on August 29, 2008. An alarmed Matt awakens from his nightmare. He discovers two more guys--a tattooed midget and Public Enemy rapper Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) in the raw--in his bed between him and his cute girlfriend Amy. Amy (Vanessa Minnillo of The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer) walks out on Will with the midget because he refuses to commit to her. Actually, Wills obsession with the end of the world prevents him from committing to Amy.Later, at the sweet sixteen party he never had, twenty-five year old Will and his friends are shaken by earthquake tremors originating near the loft where they are partying. Amy leaves the party to check on the National Museum where she works. Will and his Fat Albert best friend Calvin (newcomer Gary G-Thang Johnson) rush into the streets to witness widespread panic. A pregnant teenager, Juney (Crista Flanagan of Mad Men), the spitting image of Ellen Page in Juno, a movie about a wisecracking, knocked-up teenager, joins them. Flanagan gets some of the best lines in Disaster Movie. The closest thing to a catastrophe in Disaster Movie are the smoking vapor trails that huge green meteors make as they streak across the sky. One meteor pins Hannah Montana (Crista Flanagan again) to the ground, but she continues to sing and advertise her wares.Meanwhile, an Enchanted princess (Nicole Parker) emerges from a street man-hole and accompanies our heroes across town to the Natural Museum where an Egyptian statue has Amy pinned to the floor. Like the Clovenfield heroes, our heroes find shelter in an abandoned building. First, they encounter a look-alike Sex and the City quartet. Juney and a transvestite version of Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie (Jason Boegh of First Kiss) tangle like vicious cats. Juney kicks Carrie not only with her own feet but also with the feet of her unborn baby. Second, our heroes encounter pugnacious animatronic, sweatshirt-clad chipmunks like those from Alvin and the Chipmunks. Predictably, one chipmunk turns rabid and takes a chunk out of Wills crotch. Eventually, Will, Calvin, the Princess, and Juney reach the museum and release Amy. Amy produces the crystal skull from Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. In the second best joke, we see Indianas fedora on the floor and the shadow of the famous adventurer scooping it up. This time little man Tony Cox, the midget who played singles counselor Hitch in Date Movie, fills in for Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.Unfortunately, Friedberg & Seltzers fourth movie amounts to little more than amateur high school skits. They love humiliating celebrities. The impersonations of Amy Winehouse, Dr. Phil, Justin Timberlake, Hannah Montana, and Michael Jackson are appallingly inept. You may grin at the bawdy song lyrics, but there is nothing worth laughing-out-loud at in this potboiler. Disaster Movie pokes fun at Cloverfield, High School Musical, Superbad, Juno, Iron Man, Enchanted, The Dark Knight, The Love Guru, Night at the Museum, Twister, Wanted, Kung Fu Panda, No Country for Old Men, Beowulf, Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Speed Racer, and Sex and the City. Good spoof movies imitate what they mock, but Disaster Movie does a execrable job of merely imitating. Crista Flanagans letter perfect imitation of Ellen Page is the sole exception. Indeed, Disaster Movie contains more perspiration than inspiration. Sexy Carmen Electra, who has been in every Friedberg & Seltzer movie, plays the Angelina Jolie character from Wanted, but her role is more of a cameo. Incredibly, the filmmakers havent included any Brittany Spears scenes but Michael Jackson takes a beating twice. He is hiding in the trunk of Speed Racers jalopy between the monkey and Speeds young brother. Altogether, Disaster Movie is a disastrous line-up of lame skits thrown together without a clue.	1
So bad it sucks	Sweden	This movie was on TV once so I decided to watch it since I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay any money for it.The main character Will (played by Matt Lanter) has a dream where he meets a stone age Amy Winehouse (I think it&#x27;s supposed to be a joke) who tells him that the world is going to end the day this movie premiered in the cinema (Coincidence?) and to stop it they must find a crystal skull. Matt later wakes up to celebrate his super-sweet sixteenth birthday (despite him being in his twenties) in a scene where we get one unfunny joke and celebrity impersonation after another. Then disaster strikes (it seems kinda redundant though since this movie already is one), hurricanes, earthquakes, meteorites and other classic disaster movie ingredients hit planet earth one after another. Will, followed by his friends: Juney (Crista Flanagan), Calvin (Gary &#x22;G Thang&#x22; Johnson), and Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go out into the city and tries to find his girlfriend and a safe place and later realizes that he has to find the crystal skull to set things right.The problem with this movie is, just like other movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, that it doesn&#x27;t stay on the theme but goes all over the place and try to spoof almost every popular movie that was made that year, and some that even came later (Enchanted hadn&#x27;t come out that year, they could only have seen the trailer). And I use the term &#x22;spoof&#x22; lightly. Once again &#x22;Seltzerberger&#x22; show that they only grasp the most superficial concept of what humor is and never really bother to dig deeper and see what it is that makes things funny. Sometimes doing things outside the theme can work but not if it takes up a majority of the movie. And (for me) this movie is worse than Epic Movie. Yes you read right, Worse than Epic Movie. That movie at least had a story. Sure it was borrowed and &#x22;crapified&#x22; but at least it was a story. In this movie, everything that happens during the second act, when they try to find a safe place/figure out where they should go, just feels like a filler where the gang stumble into one reference after another. &#x22;Seltzerberger&#x27;s&#x22; over-reliance on potty humor, movie/TV references, random musical numbers, deliberately obvious stunt-doubles and crappy special effects does not save them this time.Seltzer and Friedberg, your movie sucks horribly. If I may paraphrase a line from &#x22;Billy Madison&#x22; I&#x27;d like to say: I award you only one star, and may God have mercy on your souls.Once again, if you want to see a GOOD movie made in the style that this train wreck was trying (and failing) to emulate, watch &#x22;Hotshots&#x22; &#x22;Airplane!&#x22;, &#x22;The naked gun&#x22; movies, &#x22;Top Secret&#x22; instead.	1
This aptly named movie is the worst film of 2008, the worst film of the 2000-2009 decade and possibly the worst film since the birth of motion pictures...	United States	Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be ashamed of themselves. Completely and utterly.I&#x27;m an extremely easy guy to please, especially when it comes to movies. I&#x27;m the one guy in the room who will admit to having enjoyed &#x22;Pluto Nash&#x22; and &#x22;The Mummy 3.&#x22; I&#x27;m the guy who will try to find something in every film to like. I enjoy movies, and am very rarely disappointed in them.Except for films like this, which are complete and utter idiotic failures by every stretch of the imagination. The team of Friedberg and Seltzer, whom are responsible for this abomination, should be ashamed. They have fundamentally failed understanding or displaying even the most basic ideas of filmmaking and comedy. They have failed with this film in a way which I have never before witnessed. This movie has literally made me angry in the few times I tried to sit through it, it was so insulting.How can they release such complete and utter trash like this? I actually cannot comprehend how they could have so little respect for the audience that this filth would be released.OK, fine, I&#x27;ll write an actual review. But this film ain&#x27;t pretty.This film has no plot. Literally no plot. It revolves around a group of people fleeing various disasters, while encountering a random array of pop-culture figures (including Batman, Amy Whinehouse, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, Princess Giselle from &#x22;Enchanted&#x22;, Iron Man, Hellboy, Flava Flav, Juno from &#x22;Juno&#x22;, etc.) who show up without any hint of irony or humor, introduce themselves to the camera, then awkwardly leave after a failed attempt or two at humor. Eventually they encounter a dwarf that is supposed to be Indiana Jones (played by Tony Cox) who tells them that in order to stop the disasters, they have to return a Crystal Skull to an altar. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the plot.The acting is atrocious all around. The main actors are completely unlikable and their characters are made into incredible jerks. (We&#x27;re supposed to root for our hero to get back his girlfriend even though she&#x27;s some sort of serial cheater, and the main character is the single most bland, undeveloped person you could ever encounter.) The celebrity look alikes don&#x27;t resemble the celebrities they are &#x22;parodying&#x22; in the least and make no attempt to sound or act like them. (Nicole Parker is the only one to come vaguely close as the parody of Princess Giselle from &#x22;Enchanted&#x22;, but it still fails and is ruined by a random joke that destroys the character completely) You may notice I put &#x22;parodying&#x22; in quotes above. This is because, by definition, this film fails to serve as parody even though it&#x27;s meant to be. Parody is by definition meant to comment upon or mock established original works through humor and satire. This film doesn&#x27;t do that, the characters merely show up without making any sort of comment on the original works, and are too unfunny to mock them, hence, this fails at becoming parody, hence, it isn&#x27;t parody, and Seltzer/Friedberg failed at making what they set out to.The production is among the worst I&#x27;ve seen. The direction is stale and uninspired to the point of frustration for the viewer. The special effects are some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;ve seen YouTube clips made by 12-year-olds with high production values than this. Costume and set design is painfully bad. The editing is abysmal and destroys a lot of the jokes, the animatronics are just crap. This is one of the worst productions I&#x27;ve ever seen.And the humor makes no sense. Every joke in this movie falls flat as a pancake. Jokes have no set-up, no humor, no irony and no payoff. It&#x27;s just random quips and nonsensical pop-culture references that date the film horribly.I really just an thrown a loop as to how Seltzer/Friendberg can live with themselves knowing they make films like this. This is by far their worst film, but all of their other films are nearly this bad as well. It&#x27;s honestly upsetting. They have no respect for audiences, no respect for their actors, and no creativity.This is without a doubt the worst film of 2008. It&#x27;s without a doubt the worst film of the 2000-20009 decade. And it is possibly the worst film since the birth of cinema. This makes films like &#x22;Manos: The Hands of Fate&#x22; and &#x22;Space Mutiny&#x22; look like high art. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, you should be ashamed. 1 out of 10.	1
Disaster (of a) Movie	United States	Remember the good old days when Mel Brooks did &#x22;Young Frankenstein&#x22; or David Zucker did &#x22;Airplane?&#x22; This movie will have you wishing you were watching those movies. Seltzer and Friedling don&#x27;t do movies; they create really bad sketch scenes strung together without a plot, usually embarrassing their actors along the way. It&#x27;s not funny at all, nothing has a point and at no moment does anything come close to making sense. It&#x27;s like watching the thoughts of the stars of MADTv under marijuana overdose. There are no jokes, not a decent impression and one scene is dragged on one after another. It&#x27;s basically twenty to fifty characters running into each other in search of a plot. Nicole Parker acts as if she&#x27;s on acid, Crista Flanagan looks wasted and the rest of the cast look embarrassed they agreed to do this. It&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;re looking at each other wondering &#x22;Was this in the script you read?&#x22; or &#x22;When do we start the movie?&#x22; or &#x22;I hope this isn&#x27;t used in the final draft.&#x22; Bottom line: Seltzer and Friedling need to be stopped from doing these movies. I could do it better. Anyone could do it better.	1
Rusty Nails....	United States	Yes, the title of this review is relevant. Because said instruments for bonding wood which have largely changed into iron oxide are what I wanted to shove into my eyeballs after watching this... No. I refuse to call this a movie. It&#x27;s rather closer to something you might find behind my dishwasher.So let&#x27;s dive behind said appliance for the cleaning of dinnerware and have a look at just what makes it so disgusting, shall we? Starting with the (Highly Appropriate, but not in the way they intended) title. Disaster Movie, huh? Because I see no semblance of any form of film based upon natural events which cause devastation and- oh, let&#x27;s cut the big words, there&#x27;s pretty much nothing linking this to any form of disaster flick in existence.The humor.... Seltzer and Friedburg. No more need be said on this issue.... you know, actually, that pretty much covers the entire thing right there. But, I suppose you want more in-depth... Suffice to say, humor is the wrong word; I&#x27;d call it &#x22;something that a failing-grades immature twelve-year-old who thinks toilet jokes are the pinnacle of all humor might laugh at&#x22; and even that might be a stretch. The jokes aren&#x27;t funny at all, the random scenes don&#x27;t fit in whatsoever, and they&#x27;re not even parodying their targets, just making references and effectively saying &#x22;See how stupid these movies are? Er, I farted, dur hur hur.&#x22; In short, I need to go find some rusty nails. While I don&#x27;t advocate piracy, if you must see it, go find it on the internet somewhere; it&#x27;s not even worth the two dollars to rent it from Redbox.	1
Imitation Is Not Parody	United States	Someone needs to tell the producers, the authors, the director, and everyone else involved in this film that mere imitation is not parody. To make a film satirizing whatever pop-culture is current, it isn&#x27;t enough just to string together a bunch of skits imitating those pop-culture icons. Each parody must not only imitate, but caricature the icon, whether it be a person, a particular movie, a hot toy, or whatever. It must be able to point out the absurdity of popularism while still being, in and of itself, funny as well. I can go around with a giant clock on a chain around my neck and use Blackjack gum to make myself look as if I have bad teeth, but if I don&#x27;t also have something both original AND funny to say about Flava Flav, then I am merely an imitator, not a satirist.These filmmakers may have hit it big with prior efforts, but this one was clearly phoned in. What is sad is that the bulk of the movie is so sadly, embarrassingly bad, that when the one or two genuinely funny moments occur (one character &#x22;bends&#x22; a bullet a little too much and it hooks around 360 degrees, hitting the person he was trying to avoid anyway) the audience is so stunned they forget to laugh, as if asking themselves if they really did see something genuinely funny or was so much of their intelligence already sucked away by this toilet of a movie that they are imagining humor where it doesn&#x27;t really exist? It is wicked hard to get a genuinely original and entertaining film made in Hollywood these days, bad form by these filmmakers to take money that could well have gone into a much better project and squandering it on this four reels of rubbish!	1
Well Ill give them this: The title was dead on.	None	What I mean by that, is that this move WAS a disaster. So to call it Disaster Movie is completely suitable. But that&#x27;s the only good thing I have to say about it. Now, I adore some of the actors in this movie. And I died a little bit inside because they can do SO much better. Now, my question is how did this movie ever end up in theatres? The best I would expect of it would be some MTV or MuchMusic movie that they played over the summer, but no.I just hope that those two get expelled from the business. Personally, I really want to hear them justify their movies. I just don&#x27;t get it. From the beginning there&#x27;s a full minute scene in which a bad Amy Winehouse look-a-like just burps. How is that funny? It&#x27;s not! Friedberg and Selzer, or whatever your names are: GROW UP! GROW A PAIR! And start making some really movies that are for people who aren&#x27;t 12-yr-old boys sneaking a late-night movie behind mummy and daddy&#x27;s back.	1
TVBRobotnik at the Movies: Disaster Movie	United States	Parody movies. Ah, yes. They were an opus for National Lampoon, Monty Python, Mel Brooks, the Wayans brothers, and Zucker, Abrahams, &#x26; Zucker.But, what happened? What happened is Friedberg and Seltzer. When they wrote Spy Hard and Scary Movie, they were great. Nothing idiotic, or pop-culture referenced.However, there is a major problem. They make parody films as spinoffs of Scary Movie. The first three were Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, and they were only cash cows to fit the benefit of parody films. Unfortunately, they suck! This is when Julia Jones got in rehab, Lucy, Edward, Susan, and Peter get their part-time job at McDonald&#x27;s, and the homosexual Spartans were selling cocaine for the price of one.But, I digress. They were terrible, but their next project... was MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worse! Hence is the name, Disaster Movie was born. Born to kill comedies.Seriously, why would it be successful? At least the name is correct. I mean, these films were critically panned, so why make this movie? Basically, it makes Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen look like Gone with the Wind, Epic Movie look like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the ever-so-decent Space Chimps look like Star Wars.Well, this movie barely parodies Disaster movies, it parodies pop-culture references, pre-tween Family Guy-like jokes, and movies in other genres that don&#x27;t have to do with Disaster-related films. I mean, in my school, the classmates are entertained on this film. Not me! The movie opens with a shot spoofing the one in Armageddon. In the year 10,001 B.C., a caveman runs away from a mammoth before getting in a fight with Wolf. He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse, who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008, revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull. The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will has a &#x22;Sweet Sixteen&#x22; party at his house, despite the fact that he&#x27;s 25. Will has a dream where he is a Jumper and accidentally impales.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she&#x27;s trapped under a statue, they run into Batman, who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it&#x27;s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills Speed Racer so they can hijack his car in the trunk and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will&#x27;s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive, including Kung Fu Panda, who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing &#x22;his&#x22; wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into Beowulf, who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will&#x27;s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by The Guru Shitka, who tries to get Amy to &#x22;tickle his pickle&#x22;. Then all the characters come sing a song about &#x22;dating&#x22; each other which sets of a chain (&#x22;Disaster Movie Sex Song&#x22;), ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.Generic plot-line for a parody film, hell, the jokes aren&#x27;t even funny! I can&#x27;t believe they would make this! Good news is, on Labor Day weekend, it bombed, making it 8th place at the box-office. Thank you, Tropic Thunder! You saved the day.I don&#x27;t wanna know of what they&#x27;re making next. Wait, Queen Kong??? Nooooooooooo! I don&#x27;t wanna watch Disaster Movie again. I wanna watch WALL-E again. But, it may not be as bad as... *shudder* Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen or *EVEN MORE SHUDDER (with a facepalm)* Air Buddies franchise.FINAL VERDICT: 0/10!!!!!!!!	1
Complete & Utter Rubbish	United Kingdom	I dont usually review anything, but this film is so bad that i felt i had to tell everyone i could and this seemed the best way to do it.I have never been a fan of the Movie films that have been coming out non-stop for the last 9 years, as i dont think any of them are even remotely funny, the films have no story, make no sense and the gags are almost all the same.This reaches a new level mediocrity however. The title bears no resemblance to disaster style films at all, other than one poke at twister. The whole film consists of bad impressions of superheroes, celebrities and other movies like juno, indiana jones and the incredible hulk.In summary, they really need to stop making these movies. They are outdated and unoriginal now.If Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer are reading PLEASE STOP WASTING YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY.Its just not funny anymore and hasnt been in a long, long time!!	1
What a perfect name for a terrible movie...	Sweden	Just the name of the movie itself is bad enough, but if you&#x27;re really curious about finding out what&#x27;s behind that white, disastrous poster, just one warning: You won&#x27;t be happy again for a long time afterwards.Just as &#x22;Scary Movie&#x22;, &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22; and &#x22;Epic Movie&#x22;, it is build up of cheap, ridiculous and really bad jokes. But this time they apparently didn&#x27;t care at all or even tried to make it entertaining.They make fun of celebrities in ways that has to be seen to be believed, one actor has around 10 different roles and he acts in them in the worst kind way, the supposed-to-be-funny moments are just plain stupid instead, the &#x22;special&#x22; effects aren&#x27;t special at all and the main characters are so annoying that you might start to weep just because of the bad and annoying acting! There&#x27;s nothing funny or memorable about this film, it&#x27;s just a cruel joke that shouldn&#x27;t have been made or even thought about in the first place.They probably named this film &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; because they knew it was bad but needed millions of cash extremely fast.Stay away from this truly awful movie at all costs!	1
And the title says it all!	Leeds, UK, Europe, Planet Earth, Space	Seriously. When are people going to stop making this garbage? It&#x27;s just so stupid. First we have the trashy Scary Movie series then people got inspired and made films like &#x27;Date Movie&#x27; and &#x27;Epic Movie&#x27;. And then this piece of junk blew in. I mean come on! This whole conspiracy is just going too far. Do the makers even know how agonising these movie are?! Have some dignity people! Unlike the same old hideous gags, the film makers got one thing right about this movie. It had the perfect title! Disaster Movie. Yes, it is a disaster. It&#x27;s a disaster in so many various ways. In fact such a disaster that within the first 5 minutes of this film...I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. It was just torture. I then switched to a different channel, relieving myself from the sheer disturbance I let my eyes and ears go through.Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a short definition of this trash - look no further than it&#x27;s 2-worded title! It just simply says it all! And sorry for my rating, I couldn&#x27;t rate it below 1 star. I would rather have gone for -10000!	1
stupid!	United States	This movie was 100% stupid, I am very simply amused I thought Epic Movie was great date movie is OK, but this is so stupid. When I first walked into the movie theater I wondered why I was the only one there but after 5 minutes it made perfect sense. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, avoid it at all costs! There was not even one funny scene in the whole 1 and a half hours. I think the movie might have been directed by blind, deaf and retarded monkeys! The first scene had potential, it started by saying 10,001 B.C. and that can be so funny. I wonder if the editors meant to say 9,999 BC of if they really meant 10,001? Do not ever watch this movie!	1
No Redeemign Qualities	United States	Honestly if youre thinking about watching this go watch Anus Magillicutty instead. At least that film had some redeeming qualities. This film is to cinema what Hitler was to the Jews. In future decades when people look back and saw that this movie came out and people actually went to see it theyll regard us the same way we regard cultures that believed stars were burning vents on giant chariot wheels pilot by the Gods. This film had no jokes. Picture going to see a stand-up comedian whos act was saying remember smurfs, remember snorks, remember superman thats basically what you get here, except this has even more irreverent pop culture references than a Shrek movie. Ignore this garbage.	1
You know its no good	United Kingdom	When will they stop? Not content with Scary Movies 1-500,000, Not Another Teen Movie, Date Movie, Epic Movie, Superhero Movie and Meet The Spartans, Hollywood has churned out Disaster Movie - another comedic spoof of the years biggest blockbusters - which for the most part were decent films; and in some cases Oscar winners: No Country for Old Men and Juno for example.So why spoof popular films? They were popular for a reason; and were, for he most part 1000 times better than this lazy, half-finished old horse tripe.The fundamental flaw of Disaster Movie is that its just not funny. Having Princess Gizelle from Enchanted eating glass for example is not only disgusting but also cynical and in the worst possible taste, and then theres the films attempts to be topical, by having Amy Winehouse spring up from out of a bush drinking Whisky and talking of having gasoline which was good - surely the potentially fatal drink and drug problems of such a famous person is not something to flippantly joke about, and more to the point - unashamedly cash in on; as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have.There is no plot to this film - people run around on the 29th August - as I said, not a plot, and because of this Disaster, ahem Movie (can it really be called a movie?) feels like one and a half hours of ear-bleedingly, eye-wateringly unfunny outtakes, which by the end makes one wish that like Iron Man, The Hulk and Hellboy, a cow would fall from the sky, and crush one to death.Give the &pound;5.20 ticket price for this film to charity instead.0/10 (If only IMDb let you score that)	1
its so bad its bad	United Kingdom	disaster movie is just a bunch of poor skits of movie trailers & of the moment B to Z-list celebrities, thrown together in an incoherent way. when they do try an actual JOKE they are built up and delivered with the poorest of wit and timing, with hardly any connection to each other or the story, even classed as inane comedy the jokes and delivery still fail. and the rest of the comedy is as much effort as showing a character from another film, telegraphing who it is by shouting their name and doing a bad impression of them, thats as much effort there is to it. i think in a celebrity obsessed society kids are titillated by the mere sight of a celebrity or character from another film being on screen, and thats all the joke is, another character being on screen. character from another film/celebrity+being told this is a comedy=funny? The movie is only 1 hour and 15 minutes long, which is kind of strange for a modern movie, its very short, why do you think it was so short? because they couldnt think of anymore jokes to fill in time. Seltzberg had ran out of jokes and couldnt even pad time out with actual plot or character development(the main characters are introduced by just appearing on screen in a fully formed stereotype) which would have made the movie a little(not much) better. no they just padded it out by dragging the joke out till they couldnt keep it up any longer and dragging the musical interludes out to the fullest, there is no actual tangible plot to base the skits around, the plot is just a backdrop, to show the different skits and celebs with different background scenery so the audience dont get bored. the acting is terrible, the script is terrible, the characters had no depth or real like-ability unless you are fond of stereotyped clich&eacute;d characters and arnt developed in any way, the directing is terrible. thats why its still stuck at the bottom in the IMDb list, because its probably the worst modern movie ever made.	1
The title speaks for the whole movie - its disastrous	Philippines	Just read the title. That pretty much sums up my review for this tripe. Dont come near me if you actually LIKED the film, I might snatch your eyes out and forbid you from watching movies ever again.Disaster Movie gives us a birds eye view of whats happening to Hollywood these days - harebrained sluts and ho-bags are taking over the movie industry, producing these cheap, recycled, swallowed-and-then-vomited movies which insults the intelligence of 45% of the human race.What Im trying to say here is, if you actually find the movie well-written and downright hilarious, there must be something wrong with you. Disaster Movie doesnt have a plot, no comprehensible characters, no tangible conclusion... its as shapeless as gas. It doesnt have a destination, it loiters on triviality, and the so-called Disaster goes nowhere.Comedy Value Theres only ONE scene which actually made me crack a smile. The Carrie Bradshaw and Juno MacGuff encounter. What bothers me the most is the screenplay writers/directors Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg violently raping Diablo Codys award-winning screenplay, copying every catchphrase that it has, like committing an act of plagiarism, thereby giving another reason as to why should the two of them be expelled from Hollywood.The movie is chock-full of clich&eacute;s. Whod laugh at Iron Man, Hellboy and the Incredible Hulk getting crushed by a falling cow? Whod laugh at Hancock hitting his head on a lightpost? Whod laugh at that stupid Women of Wrestling (WoW) skit near the beginning? (Well for those who actually found these scenes funny and risible, you better check if your brain is still functioning.)Story Disaster Movie doesnt have a story. Seems like all the two blockheads have done is to collect as much movie characters as they can and alter their image by transforming them into obscene, cussing retards. Then, they line them up, and one by one, they get a share of their screen time. Theres your story.DISASTER MOVIE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST STUPID MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Do not watch this film, for the sake of humanity. This film will ruin your day by feeding you huge doses of sheer stupidity. Its like every time you laugh while watching this film, your IQ is reduced by 2. Every applause that youd give to this film persuades more stupid parodies to come and make men lose their sense of humor. If you actually enjoyed this, youre as air-headed as the two screenwriters.PLEASE, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM AT ALL. YOU WILL TOTALLY REGRET IT. Ive watched it from start to finish, and my intellect just lost its virginity.	1
A disaster of a movie doesnt even describe it	United Kingdom	Will (Lanter) has always struggled with relationships and wants to prove to Amy that he has it in him to make it, only the world is coming to an end on the same day.Any review, any trailer or anything relative cant show how bad Disaster Movie is unless you actually go to the cinema to watch it.The plot is conventional and boring, the spoofs of current cinema releases are inaccurate and too crude and every other joke drags and drags until you cant look at the screen any more.The naked gun trilogy provided plenty of giggles but these modern day spoofs including Date movie and Epic movie just basically ruin the originals, with exceptionally poor jokes and stunts, and this film is just pathetic in every sense. Is there a point to these films other than short term profit? Will these be made into long term classics? Who will remember certain films or celebrities in 10 years time when watching this? The movie opens in 10,001 BC, really poor choice, and prehistoric Amy Winehouse sets the tone of what the film will be like, cheap digs at celebrities and other films.Hellboy, Batman, Ironman, The Hulk, Enchanted, Hancock, Juno, Beowulf, Indiana Jones and Sex and the City among others are the main films to be spoofed, while Winehouse, Miley Cyrus and Jessica Simpson are also slated, not to mention a really stupid skit on Justin Timberlake.Stupid, inaccurate, boring, predictable, the only positive thing to say is this film seems to know that its goal is to entertain, which it does so by being so unfunny that you have to occasionally laugh at how poor it truly is.I personally felt robbed of &pound;7 after I left, not to mention embarrassed at actually sitting through the whole film. We pay honest money to go out and have a good time, and even if a film is not to our taste, then there will be some consolation to our night, but Disaster Movie made me want to stop watching films all together.This niche will continue to grow which is very sad in the industry. Parodies can be funny, but not if they are crude, predictable and down right shocking.Disaster Movie is an awful thing, and not worth the time or energy.	1
Awful ... and awkward!	United States	There arent enough negative words in the dictionary to adequately describe how awful this movie was. No plot. No continuity. The writers seem to think profanity is a valid substitute for witty dialogue. The only disaster was that this movie was released on an unsuspecting public. But wait! Theres more. We had the ultimate awkward experience! Not only were we subjected to one of the worlds worst movies, but the star and a large group of his family & friends happened to be seated in front of us and next to us. We wanted to walk out on the movie, but how do you tell the stars aunt, Oh, sorry. Your nephew is really cute, but nothing he does can save this total piece of crap. Were out of here! At least my husband learned a valuable lesson from this experience - if the movie title contains the word movie... dont waste your money! Run, dont walk, away from this movie as fast as you can!	1
Disaster of a movie	Germany	Well, normally my time is too valuable to comment on such crap, but this movie sucks so much, that i see it as my duty to warn you against this movie. Where shall I begin? I think its the best to start with the trailer: I hate trailers of comedies because you usually see the best jokes before watching the movie. But this time, even the trailer wasnt funny. Then i saw the movie and the only time I was laughing was when i actually saw someone who laughed about the movie... I cant even recommend this movie if you are a trash-fan. Because there is no movie to compare it with, I chose something else. If you enjoy staring into space, then you MIGHT find this movie funny. While writing this comment, this movie is at the top of the Bottom 100. And this is the only place to be for this movie.	1
Awful! Awful! Awful!	United Kingdom	This left me speechless......and not in a breath-taking &#x22;Shawshank Redemption&#x22; type way! I literally wanted to rip my arm off and throw it at the TV it was so bad. My husband and I made a bet with one another as to who could keep watching it the longest........the loser buying the weekend beers! I was quite happy to lose that night. I had no idea what was going on, it kept skipping from one sketch to another with no plot, no reason and NO POINT! Awful acting, awful impressions, awful film! Pretty much is what it says on the tin, A Disaster. Do not watch this movie. You&#x27;d be better off stapling your genitals to a table for an hour...it&#x27;ll be less painful for you!	1
How to make a parody without jokes	Belgium	Whenever someone doesn&#x27;t like a movie, a common go-to criticism to hurl at it is that it has no plot. In reality, this is usually a load of crap. A movie can have a plot you don&#x27;t like, or it can have a plot that&#x27;s a bit contrived, but pretty much every movie has a plot. This brings us to &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22;. This movie has no plot! I mean, there sorta kinda are four main characters, but they&#x27;re basically just mannequins who stand there while unfunny things happen around them. The order of the scenes honestly doesn&#x27;t matter at all, this is almost like a sketch movie but without the punchlines. I&#x27;m not a big fan of writing classes (read my reviews for further proof), but what ever happened to the classic story structure where protagonists have to reach some kind of goal while fighting some kind of adversity? Have I just gotten too old-fashioned for the movies, is this the kind of experimental filmmaking that will become a standard for further generations? Well, as of this writing this movie&#x27;s got a whopping 1.9 rating, so I think I&#x27;m safe. Got to admit though, I did laugh once during the otherwise terrible &#x22;Sex and The City&#x22;-spoof. Sue me, I probably deserve it.	1
Worst ever	United States	I have had root canal surgeries that were more fun. This mess makes &#x22;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#x22; (long considered the worst movie ever made) look like an Academy Award contender. The basic idea is good, make fun of all the disaster movies, but the actual movie is horrible. I get the feeling that the makers got high on something and just threw whatever came to mind into the script, figuring the audience would be too dumb to understand. These people should be banned from ever making another film and kept away from all movie cameras. I managed to sit through a total of 15 minutes and felt like I should wash my eyes and brain out with bleach to get rid of the memory. Terrible doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it.	1
Ronseal. Does exactly what is says on the tin. Disatser Movie. Does exactly what is says in the title!	United Kingdom	This is without doubt a contender for the worst movie in cinematic history - past, present and future!The humour is painfully unfunny and can be interpreted as offensive on occasions. There is nothing wrong with offensive humour (well there is), if it&#x27;s rather humorous, just ask Sacha Baron Cohen - however this is unquestionably offensive to any human with an average intellect.Jason Friedberg I actually admire for evolving the &#x27;horror spoof&#x27; with his fine comedy &#x27;Scary Movie&#x27;, which occasionally had me in stitches. This however, borders on the lines of disgracefulness.Matt Lanter prancing around for the entire duration with woeful lines and abysmal acting may appeal to the less intellectual women who need to keep there eyes occupied for approximately an hour and a half. However, everyone else will be left feeling mugged, either for the fact they have wasted their precious lives on this drivel, or - even worse - they have spent good money on this drivel.I think my verdict is loud and clear!	1
I laughed at how ironic the title is more than anything else.	United Kingdom	I might have only sat through only half of the film, but from that I came to the decision that I didn&#x27;t want to watch anymore. It&#x27;s not funny in the slightest. In fact, I laughed at how ironic the title is more than anything else. Whoever gave this the green-light should be sacked immediately. I do have a couple of the films in which this tries to parody and fails miserable, like Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, and all I can say is that it completely destroys them - it actually made me angry. This is truly a Disaster Movie. This film made me cringe with all the incredible badness of it all. I will never watch this film all the way through. However when I do, I want an award.	1
Excruciatingly unfunny	Ohio	There have been several different movies that I&#x27;ve seen in my life that were so painfully awful I was sure there would be no other to be worse, I have sat through movies like Alone in the Dark, Battlefield earth, North, and this piece of shi* trying to pass itself off as a comedy is unquestionably the absolute worst thing I&#x27;ve ever seen.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are the most talentless hacks ever to pick up a video camera or use a keyboard. My head felt like it was going to explode after I finished watching because it enraged me so much.Here is a small list of things this movie tries to parody, and somebody needs to explain to me what any of them have to do with the disaster genre.Juno, American Gladiators, Mylie Cyrus, Flavor Flav, Amy Winehouse, Jessica Simpson, and lots others that I feel should have sued the hell out of these assholes for including them in this vomitorium of a film.This plot makes absolutely NO SENSE AT ALL! It consists entirely of jokes so awful that it&#x27;ll make you sick having to hear them. At one point they accuse Juno of having bad writing, the hypocrisy and Irony was big enough to see from space.I don&#x27;t want to continue thinking too much about the horrible experience I had viewing this wretch, so I will end by saying this is no doubt the worst movie ever made in history and If you laugh at ANYTHING in this heap you are an idiot and a waste of life, plain and simple.	1
Id rather be tortured than watch this again!	United Kingdom	Undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching in my life!This film, and I use the term loosely, was so awful that it is one of only a handful I have ever switched off in order to be bored instead- as being bored is preferable to having your eyes gouged out by this dreadful piece of garbage. The story is non existent, even to the extent of parody, and the parody itself is done abysmaly with virtually no reference to the source material at all. In fact, this film is almost entirely made up of &#x27;parody&#x27; versions of clips from other films that were only taken from the trailers from said movies- the vast majority of which aren&#x27;t disaster movies in the first place. How this is supposed to pass for a comedy film when it has no plot, virtually no parody and fewer jokes than the most dirgeful funeral I have attended is beyond me. Perhaps that is the joke? If so, it&#x27;s not funny.Whilst the rest of the genre made by (some of) the same production team such as Date Movie and Superhero Movie at least made parodical reference and jokes based upon films from the genre the relevant film was named after, Disaster Movie instead is just a description of what the end product turned out to be. We can but hope that this film puts nails in the coffin of the directors careers so they can go and be more productive in the film industry sweeping floors or emptying bins- footage of which would be more entertaining than this drivel.Mark my words- no matter how bored you are, how cheap this becomes on disk or how free it may be on the internet- do not waste your time watching it. You will only regret the loss of those precious minutes of your life, which could have been spent more satisfyingly and less painfully by watching paint dry whilst being beaten about the head with a mallet.Forced watching of this film should be added to the bans under the Geneva Convention as torture. I for one would rather be water-boarded than see this film again. You have been warned!	1
Awful	None	I must say first of all, that I did not expect this to be a very good movie, or even all that funny, just a few laughs. What I got, was a complete lack of humor. Not a single joke made me laugh say but two where I mildly smiled. First of all, this barely had anything to do with as disaster happening, except for a few earthquakes now and then. Most of the movie consists of 1. throwing in as many references from other movies as possible, in context to absolutely nothing and 2. abysmal rap numbers every 5-10 minutes, that just made me want to bash my head in with a hammer. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of crap.	1
The masterpiece without a message	Baltimore, MD	One of the early scenes in Pulp Fiction features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and its also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didnt know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, Pulp Fiction wouldnt be Pulp Fiction. I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.Its no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. Pulp Fiction, is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or art about art. It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives Ive ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, Be cool and no ones going to get hurt, which is just the type of line youd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines arent just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mias statement to Vincent, Thats when you know youve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.What is the movies purpose exactly? Im not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.Theres a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but were never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really about anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind.	10
Simply The Best	England	To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.	10
One of the best movies of the century!	Warsaw, Poland	If you think Pulp Fiction is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many f words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is cool, he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about Pulp Fiction? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece.	10
Unbelievable.	Canada	Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it.	10
The Movie that redefined a genre	Halifax, Canada	Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film.	10
It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!	United States	My oh my.  Pulp Fiction is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.	7
Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece	Barcelona, Catalunya	Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a tough guy image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger... is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.	8
One of the Best Films Ive Seen In A LONG Time... and still is	United States	Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? Its filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that weve seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jacksons superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time youre surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... Ill leave to you.	10
Awesome!	None	I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they werent sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didnt think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930s (even to my one fairly hip relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travoltas pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jacksons sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Williss deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you cant help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later films sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990s, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, dont miss another 1990s Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.)	6
Tour de Force	Oregon, USA	Thats what this 1994 film is, a tour de force cinematic expression by Quentin Tarantino. A film with which Tarantino staked his claim to the title of genuine Hollywood wunderkind, auteur, young genius, all ala Orson Welles. Pretty heady stuff.By what means? First, with a snappy script with witty if not cerebral give-and-take dialog, written mainly by Tarantino himself. Then, by populating the cast with an intriguing hand-picked array of actors to deliver those well-written snappy lines. This film oozes inspired casting, of actors who either played against type or at least became offbeat and edgy in ways in which we hadnt hitherto known them. Then, through the editing process, by telling the story in a maximum non-linear way, out of time, reducing the film to a series of seeming disjointed non-sequential vignettes, each vignette featuring the aforementioned snappy dialog delivered by the aforementioned hand-picked edgy actors. It is only after watching the entirety of the movie, and reflecting back on it, does the gestalt emerge for the viewer. And, it may take more than one viewing to get there. Then, lastly, by topping it all off with a snazzy soundtrack. Thats how. Add all that stuff together and you get Pulp Fiction.The film received its share of acclaim, and deservedly so. But that said, while seen by most as a good film, Pulp Fiction is not regarded as another Citizen Kane, and Pulp Fiction is not ensconced in the pantheon of the greatest of the great Hollywood films of all time. Those are for a reason. As good a cinematic achievement as Pulp Fiction is, the fact is that as a film it plows turf thats just way too coarse for comfort. Over-the-top blood, guts, and brains-blown-out violence. Gritty gutter language. Subject matter dwelling in the underbelly of life that goes way beyond seedy or unseemly. And its all presented in a very graphic way. Some people really like it that way. Hey, I understand. Thats what Tarantino wanted too, right? But the simple fact is that such fare isnt for everyone. Period. In this way its own intentional and unrelenting coarse nature is what self-selects it out of the greatness category. To achieve greatest of the greats greatness it has to be seen that way across the board, amongst every audience. Pulp Fiction by Tarantinos design isnt intended to appeal to everyone.And whither Tarantino? Thats the real question. His career didnt actually begin with Pulp Fiction, what with the auspicious start he made a couple of years earlier with Reservoir Dogs (1992). And Pulp Fiction of course certainly wasnt his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol. I and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and ambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But lets be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more like Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasnt moved much beyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, hes still earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it too, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a measure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films in him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new directions, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways as a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus. Which isnt a terrible thing. Pulp Fiction is a remarkable movie. But, hey, we thought thered be more.	9
The rebirth of a genre  and film history	wherever good films play	I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what weve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines  its a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if its just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then theres the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with Pulp Fiction. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of chapters  there is so much playful creativity at play here, its just a pure joy to watch.If youre a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats  and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even stealing from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantinos masterpiece today, its impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after Pulp Fiction. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, its got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - its such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. Its  well: its Pulp Fiction. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/	10
The Most Overrated Film in Existence...	Latvia	Pulp Fiction is the quintessential 90s crime film. Pulp Fiction changed the cinematic landscape when it was released, it broke new grounds in terms of screen writing and revived the career of John Travolta. And so on and so forth. In other words, Pulp Fiction is important film in the history in cinema, but its not the best film ever. I have seen Pulp Fiction several times and after each time seeing it, I tend to enjoy it less. I saw it first time a few years ago and loved every second of it. But after seeing few hundred more films and especially grindhouse/exploitation films, Pulp Fiction starts to loose its charm. Before I continue this thought, I should name the good stuff first. I loved every moment with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. They did a phenomenal job and elevated the already strong dialog. Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel were also great and so are the scene with Christopher Walken is still amazing. But aside from the strong acting and great dialog, there isnt a whole lot to Pulp Fiction. Its just bunch of stories that happened in non- linear fashion. Its all being hip and cool and saying clever dialog. There isnt any complex characters like in Jackie Brown and it lacks the creative visuals of Django Unchained or the tension of Inglorious Basterds. I wont deny that Pulp Fiction is very entertaining but there just isnt enough substance or craftsmanship involved to endure multiple viewings.Films like Apocalypse Now, Lady Vengeance, Taxi Driver, Clockwork Orange and many others, holds up much better after watching them multiple times. Those films can be enjoyed purely from the technical aspects and as well as the story and characters. Pulp Fiction is a popcorn film for those who enjoy dialog, cool characters and movie references. I like films with an emotional core, strong characters and impressive visuals. Pulp Fiction is a film that most of the people have seen. If you havent then go watch it because its entertaining, very accessible 90s crime film. To me Pulp Fiction feels dry and lacks the elements that draw me in films.	7
Why Did People Like this?	New Haven, CT	Why did people like this?Tiresome streams of pop-culture references?(like kane in Kung Fu Elvis or Beatles? Brady Bunch or Hogan's Heroes? Buffy St. Marie or Dusty Springfield? Leo Sayer or Captain & Taneall?)mundane out of context dialogue?(wow this coffee sure is good. I didn't expect you to have such good coffee.  this is one mean cup of joe!)Hip depictions of Drug Culture.?It's annoying bellyflop into the middle of the retro craze fashion herd?one dimensional characters pointing guns at each other's heads? (the cheapest, most half-assed, most cliched way to generate drama = person pointing gun at another person's head.  And yelling. over and over.)cool sunglasses?Take these things out, and the movie still isn't very good. Leave them in and it's trendy and annoying.If you are a teenager and don't know anything about HK films, films from the 70s, or the 70s in general, are easily duped by hype, I urge you to see this movie. It was made for you!! It will TOTALLY BLOW YOU AWAY, MAN! Dude!	5
Too long, too boring with poor story development	None	It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesnt work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isnt.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He played a dance, which isnt the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesnt dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isnt a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys arent just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isnt like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didnt have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesnt last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isnt a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece dont know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they dont really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip.	3
9 IMDb? Really?	Egypt	Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.This is the most overrated film of all time. Im even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didnt like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothings wrong. Its a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were OK movies but didnt deserve the huge credit they received.I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. Im not going to tell those of you that havent seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Dont listen to anyones opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then youre COOL!	1
Could Be Most Overrated Movie Of All Time	Bayside, San Andreas	Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isnt.First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they dont.Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isnt a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess.	1
Flat and Brainless	United States	As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. Id discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadnt before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving Pulp Fiction just as much as I did back then, but I didnt. There was nothing there, no core. All the things Id loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that cant decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? Its violence thats harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.Its a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in its favor is that its somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but thats not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like Andrei Rublev is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. Pulp Fiction is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. Its very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. Its so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But its paper thin. This is exactly what I dont want in cinema	2
Umm...?	United States	So there is a lot of hype surrounding Pulp Fiction. It won Original Screenplay. It was nominated for six other Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. I see it is given four out of four stars if it is on TV. It is also in IMDbs Top 250. (But) what is the big deal about it? I was bored and disappointed. Pulp Fiction did not really make a whole lot of sense. I can not remember if it was nominated for editing or not. If they wanted to be in that category or have a better chance at winning then obviously more editing should have happened. I do not see the point of Vince and Mias date. All if not a lot of that should have been cut. Why drag on Bruce Willis being on the run from the mafia don? That took too long. Was the whole story about the watch necessary? Couldnt Bruce and his woman just talk about it? Aside from being disappointing and boring Pulp Fiction was confusing. Bruce shoots John Travolta. And kills him. So how is he alive in The Bonnie Situation? Does Quentin Tarrantino not like editing too much? Well more editing could be needed a lot of times.(PF hint hint.) So yeah Pulp Fiction was boring, disappointing, confusing, etc. It should not have won Original Screenplay. It should have gone to someone else but if all five nominees were bad then it should have been none of them. Too much hype. Too much movie. Overrated. I can not remember much of this movie and happily so. So what is such the big deal?	4
the most over valued film of the '90s	Rome, Italy	Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min!	2
blood and f****** spirituality	Virginia	I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole Jules redemption-speech by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.	8
A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.	Toronto, Ontario, Canada	There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called style. There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve.Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesnt necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldnt wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines).The strangest thing is, while the characters are in character, as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. Theres really only a decent short film in all of this.The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesnt connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing.Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70s music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there.While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because hes alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesnt have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roths character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler.As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated.	1
Unadulterated dreck	Wisconsin USA	This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB.	1
Redemption? Spirituality? Yeah, Right.	Seattle, WA	The comments for Pulp Fiction generally fall into one of three categories: 1) Awesome Dude! The best movie ever! raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.I had read about Reservoir Dogs (but not seen it) when Pulp was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. Apocalypse Now and Seven are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of Pulp. I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that Pulp Fiction has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.***SPOILERS*** One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.***END SPOILERS***Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new (Rashomon), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue (Scarface, for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk.	3
The worst movie I've ever seen	United States	I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do.	1
One-dimensional modernist pap (minor spoilers)	United States	Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people?  Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content?  I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.Why is this movie so bad, you ask?  Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here.  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off.	1
Enormously Overrated	Backwoods Canada	The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadnt finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.Indeed, thats the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. Its a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who cant get the story straight and have to keep going back: Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . . I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I dont think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and thats why so much is so pointless.The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they dont fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. Its like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when Shut the f*ck up, fat man! is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy.	5
Hands down, the best film of the '90s.	south carolina	Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product.	5
Good Yet Over-rated	United States	Quentin Tarantino is a good director who has a knack for combining wildly imaginative music selections for his movies that seem to work so well you have to laugh with joy.He also is known for dark comedy, combining unexpected twists that dismay audience members to the point they often refer to him as a genius.The problem with genius is that what is genius to some is mundane to others. Tarantino is also known for his plot twists. However the excessive focus on plot twists creates an expectation from the audience, which opposes the basic appeal: the element of surprise.In Pulp Fiction, twists are introduced with little finesse. Tarantino has improved with the years, but Pulp Fiction, an early film, becomes boring before it is over.Certainly worth watching, but early and raw compared to Tarantinos later films.	6
Didnt like it at all! its just me, I guess...	Greece	I have watched 75% percent of this film twice: the first time, I watched it on TV, and about 3 quarters of the way, I gave up... However, due to the films cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didnt like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...Why is that?First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didnt like at all...Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantinos films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldnt be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasnt the actors that disappointed me, but the films script...So, the verdict:It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems Im one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction...	3
One of My Favorite Movies Ever	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	The hit-men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that Gods hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. Pulp Fiction is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption and the winner and weakest Forrest Gump) with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. Pump Fiction saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult Reservoir Dogs. The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Pulp Fiction  Tempo de Violncia (Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence)	10
The worst Movie ive ever seen in my life.	United States	Absolutely no idea why this film is so popular. I was bored out of my mind from the first scene to the last waiting patiently for a twist of some sort to tie the multiple stories together, which never happened. Probably my least favorite movie ive ever watched. The acting wasnt bad and the film did tie in some aspects of popular culture and previous films, but if the viewer doesnt give a crap about any of the characters whatsoever, or the plot(if you could call it that), then whats the point. I gained nothing from watching this movie besides an intense feeling of emptiness that usually comes after wasting 150 or so minutes of your life watching a pathetic piece of crap film about nothing. Was I at the edge of my seat, yes, however It wasnt because of the suspense, I couldnt keep my head from falling forward or my eyes open. And the way that the scenes were arranged, terrible. The movie memento is hard to follow sometimes and slightly dull at some points but at least there was a freaking point in the way the scenes were arranged, considering the main character had memory problems. In this movie, there was no reason for the random mix up of the scenes, except to just do something different and make a movie so weird and disgusting the critics think its a masterpiece. I usually like movies that are critically acclaimed, like The Godfather, one of my favorite movies, but Pulp Fiction isnt even in the ball park. There isnt the dark complex characters like in the godfather, just a bunch of rambling idiots tripping over their stupidity.	1
Terrible	United Kingdom	This movie is definitely the most overrated piece of sh*t ever.No story, no plot, no message, just Tarantino so totally in love with his own witty dialogue.The movie is empty in every sense of the word. In addition, its also horribly boring and therefore ridiculously hard to watch. I always try to sit through every movie I start, but damn, with this one it was a hard task not to simply get up and walk away.Pulp Fiction does not deserve to be on top of IMDbs list of best rated movies with actual masterpieces like The Shawshank Revenge. The latter is a work of art, Pulp Fiction is merely a piece of sh*t dressed up as one and its amazing how many people fall for it.	1
Boring	United Kingdom	Boring. Rubbish Film as per most of Tarantinos stuff. The only good film Tarantino ever directed was the first half of Dusk till Dawn. True Romance was good as well,though he didnt direct it. It was also let down somewhat by Tarantinos poor dialogue (see Patricia Arquettes speech where she reveals shes a call girl. Appalling dialogue. Very Tarantino.) I recommend you spend you time better by watching all the films hes paid homage to (ripped off) such as Vanishing Point, Death rides a horse, the Baby Cart series, The original Inglorious Bastards etc Tarantino and his rehashing of films which have passed out of the collective conscious is pretty unpleasant and not clever. The whole point of taking influence from other peoples work is to then create something of your own which is greater than the sum of its part. This Tarantino fails to do repeatedly.	1
no substance	None	The 90s sucked. It was one of the major eras of entitlement, and dagnummit, Quentin Tarantino was ENTITLED to the stylistic gimmicks he absorbed from French new wave, 70s exploitation and martial arts films. He was entitled to use every character as a mouthpiece for his preciously quirky, offbeat voice. He was entitled to that word that makes Spike Lee mad when white people use it. He was entitled to co-opt obnoxious heroin- chic, hip retro-fauxhemian fashion trends. Tarantinos movies echo the problem with Modernism: okay, you think the status quo is Bad, but if what you do is just a kneejerk reaction to that status quo with no values, ethos or any sort of moral core, how can you be sure the result wont also be Bad? In fact, chances are it will probably be Worse! Right? Nonsense. The emperor doesnt appear to have clothes, but thats just because only the most profound, virtuous people can see them. You want to be part of that group, right...?	6
People Acting Stupid	Terra	*********Spoiler Warning**********When this movie came out a lot of people I knew were making a big deal about it because it was made by a guy from Knoxville who even talked about K-town in the movie---and guess where I lived at the time?  Most people overlooked that Tarantino was only born there and lived most of his life somewhere else, and both Tarantino and Knoxville are highly overrated.  Trust me.I can't see why this movie is regarded as highly as it is; it seems the key to Tarantino's storytelling is to mix together story elements kind of like a blender.  So we get things like the cab driver who's a sexy latin woman who'd look more at home in a luxury restaurant than a grungy cab, or the very seventies looking Samuel L. Jackson running around with the nineties looking John Travolta.  The result is the average person goes that's kind of strange, while the intelligentsia go yes, the man is a GENIUS!I put off seeing this movie for several years because of the supposed extreme violence and the notorious rape scene.  When I finally broke down and watched it I was surprised how tame it was, even the rape scene was mostly people shouting behind a closed door.  It was nowhere near as scary or unnerving as the one in Deliverance.  In the end the violence was mainly psychological or limited, although the guy getting shot in the car and bits of you-know getting everywhere was a real turn-off.But really what did the movie in for me was the plot, or lack thereof. Supposedly we're getting an homage to film noir and hardboiled fiction novels of the forties, done up in a modern story theme.  What we see on the screen is a confused mess of people running around and doing the most stupid things.  It's not a horrid movie, but there's a lot better ways to spend a few hours.	7
Overrated  C R A P	Norway	Yes, thats right. Crap. This film is just that. If you take a closer look at f.ex. Bruce Willis, who seems to make people scream their head off every time hes near the screen, you can clearly see that this person lacks personality. He has two expressions: One that says ON, (with a little wrinkle above his nose) the other is of course OFF, when hes asleep. a machine of a man, which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home, because hes in desperate need for a personality, some feelings, a higher IQ and an even bigger paycheck.Why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there. Voting, cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors, musicians, artists etc. That is why this world goes straight down the toilette. Making your modern remarks that everything is so Cool all the time.Pulp Fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director. There is no inventions, no good or natural acting, no deeper meaning with this movie at all. Just exploitation.The era of good movie-productions are long gone. Classic actors like Chaplin, Bogart, Cooper, Peck, Holden and Quinn dont get born any more. Today its just you gray and unpersonalized people out there (With some exceptions), watching to see if theres something that can kill your brain even more, with splatter and gore above your ears. Yeah, youre a really cool bunch, drowning on dry land.	1
Totally underwhelmed	Manchester, England	This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma & Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.But it's fashionable, so it's popular.By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it.	2
I'm afraid it's no good what-so-ever.	Croatia	What is it with this film? What IS IT!?!? Gangsters walking and saying absolutely nothing. A lot of idle and boring dialogue. Boring stories. Clich&eacute;d camera angles and borrowed materials from other films. And a whole lotta f-words to fill a space-cruiser. Some acting is good, but that's the actor for you...Everything else is empty, empty, empty... Peer-pressure and the moronic masses of people say this film is a masterpiece! How? Because they talk about Quater Pounders with Cheese? Because of the morale of the gangster? What morale? We cool? We cool. Yeah those phrases have absolute impact...ooh hoo, bobby!Yeah this is the movie that re-defined cinema... without re-defining it at all.Skip this trash and watch something else... for the love of movies,please do that!	1
A creative and slick waste of time	United States	You want to do something really neat? Take the movie Pulp Fiction and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks.	1
The most ludicrously inflated reputation of any film	Eel Pie Island	The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.Its only entertainment, I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two.	1
The most overrated and unimportant film of the century	The Greater Southwest	It is neat to believe in your heart that you are hip. And if you can obtain coolness by watching a movie, wow! I believe that everybody who says they like Pulp Fiction thinks they are cool. They think that a movie with such style and witty banter is only for the hip. The only problem is that this film is as empty as a Scottish pay toilet and perhaps the most pretensious piece of nothing ever. If you have not figured it out yet, there is no story here. Tarantino simply shoots a pointless movie and then breaks it up so that we do not see it in its proper sequence. So things that happen last come before things that finished before and vice versa. You start to wonder, gee, am I not intelligent enough to follow this? Then you realize, uhhh, no, it is actually fairly simple. He is just stringing a bunch of scenes along in no particular order. Then he gives unrealistic and long-winded speeches to characters that are not particularly realistic. It does not make the film really bad, but at the same time, it does not make it good either. You can paint a piece of crap all kinds of different colors, but it is still a piece of crap. I wonder if Tarantino has the talent to actually tell a real story without having to resort to fancy tricks, shocking scenes and other gimmicky tricks. I doubt it. Oh well, I guess I am just not that cool. I mean, Samuel Jackson sure did say some funny things.	1
What a great but useless attempt........	India	Pulp Fiction is a movie all credited to its director....Mr. Q. T. This movie is such an amazing and fast track of events all tied up nicely and cohesively that one cant deny its grandeur.But here comes the boom. It is a highly un-required movie that is overrated just due to its above mentioned qualities. But when something is made there must be a purpose behind its existence but the film is so useless and itchy that in my opinion this film is not the best film in history of cinema. Yes the film has a huge potential to influence movie making and direction but it itself is nothing but a crap of laughable and senseless events.So to mention Sir i am not buying any of this movie but lets just consider the direction and cohesion of events.	5
Crazyness all over the board	United States	for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vinces heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lances house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film.	8
A few interesting moments but no classic	Stockport, England	Ive never really understood the love for this film. There are some good actors in it (Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Harvey Keitel), there are some mediocre actors in it (John Travolta, Uma Thurman), there are some very funny moments and the different stories colliding is an interesting idea. However all the characters are two dimensional and when Tarantino himself appears it becomes apparent that the characters are all him really: limited in imagination, mouthy, insecure and angry. Really Ive seen 30 minutes TV episodes with more depth and characterization. There are some laughs and genuine suspense but none of it really leads anywhere. Any time a character begins to say anything interesting another character has a sudden attack of tourettes and its brushed over quickly. It irritates me that one of the main characters dies halfway through but features in the rest of the film because its shown in a silly order. Its a bleak world-view and its not one I share. Id say this is an above average film but only just.	6
nothing but a bullshit art-house stuff	None	i watched the film 20 years later since its making and attain 0% satisfaction of viewing pleasure considering its 5h top position on IMDb. The movie is an experimental art house crap that chooses no destination and lack brilliant, appealing sketching of its theme. The dialogues are the heartbeat of the film that lose its rhythm every moment when stretching same words to make viewers understood the characterss stand, view in perplexing crime world and how they perceive.The one thing, the film depressingly is in desire of clapping is Bruce Willis part of a boxer, who is feared but not a coward. The rare male protagonist with conscience.Uma Thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug, lust and hunger to live free.Tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity, but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty.I have watched it and guarantee You waste of time	1
Pretty bad!	None	The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone whos afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema!	3
Random scenes	None	The movie is as bad. If Aleksandr Nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful. YOur Tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of Aleksandr Nevsky. His movies are not badass nor funny. Aleksnadr Nevskys movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes. the movie has not script it was directed on the go. Tarantino no scirpt means bad business. I thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as Treasure Hunters by Aleksandr Nevksy but it is no. No no no just very really no. Avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch Aleksandr Nevskys movies. They are very underrated. Pulp fiction is overrated because Tarantino is no Aleksandr NEvsky. I know good you know bad.	1
Violence and Redemption Underscore Pulp Fiction	United States	Pulp Fiction is considered Quentin Tarantino masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although its not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, Pulp Fiction has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between Pumpkin and Honey Bunny as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and were seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- hell drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasnt been working on the level of Pulp Fiction. Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallaces (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date thats not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When hes on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I dont know why it never gets old, but it doesnt. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with The Bonnie Situation. The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincents heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle thats cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, Reservoir Dogs, and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of Pulp Fiction has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in Reservoir Dogs you wont see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesnt quite flow like a Tarantino film that weve become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. Hes not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is The Gold Watch section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his Die Hard facial expressions, especially when theyre not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we wont care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard its pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. The Gold Watch has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. The Bonnie Situation may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally shot Marvin the face. The Bonnie Situation offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he walks the earth. Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesnt make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing Pumpkin (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be Pumpkin and Honey Bunnys last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways.	10
Not very original	Long Beach, CA	It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two.	2
I hate this movie	None	Pulp Fiction in my opinion is the most overrated movie of all-time.  I really don't understand why many people claim it to be one of the greatest movies ever.  It's cruel, stupid, idiotic.  It's full of violence & f-words to the point that it's sickening.  It's like, let's get a couple of guns, a couple of f-words, a couple of murders and let's combine them to make a movie.  I hated everything about it.  EVERYTHING.  To me, all the positive comments on this site about this movie are written by only 1 fan under different usernames.  So the scenes were not in chronological order, big deal.  That doesn't make it a masterpiece.  This is hollywood garbage. There are some scenes that are sick.  The movie is SICK.  This is my review. I gave it a 2/10 just because the actors are respected.  Everything else is idiotic.	2
A groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking	Portugal	What can I say about Pulp Fiction that hasnt already been said before? That it is arguably one of the best movies ever made and that after twenty years since its release remains a dazzling and original piece of brilliant filmmaking? Well, of course I could say all that, but I still wouldnt be making this magnificent movie justice. Theres the amazing screenplay, exploding with pop culture references, and whose merits raise far above its plot and are really more related to the brilliant character development and the awesome mix of comedy and tragic that are so beautifully brought to life by the awesome cast. And then of course theres everything else, the amazing direction, the superb editing and the even more superb soundtrack. Tarantino has this ability to select an handful of songs that, far more than just cool and nice sounding (ala Goodfelas or Boogie Nights, for instance) manage to give meaning to the scenes in which they are played. And thats just one of the million things that makes this movie so special and above all with such an high rewatchability value. And among those things theres also of course the unlikelihood of everything we see happening on screen and the unfolding of events that makes glued to the screen even after dozens of views... Summing up my thoughts, Pulp Fiction is a groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking that still manages to dazzle and surprise audiences after 20 years of its release. Its not just one of my favorite movies, its also the movie that made me look at films from a different point of view, almost forcing me to love them as much as I love books. Please, if you havent watched it yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it. But get ready, cus its gonna be a bumpy ride!	10
Pulp Fiction.	Cardiff	Quentin Tarantino has to be one of the best directors of the 90s and Pulp Fiction is without doubt one of the best films ever made. This film also has one of the best casts ever assembled, the list of big names is endless. If you havent seen this film then you need to watch it as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed. How it won just one Oscar I will never know, it defiantly deserved more in my opinion. If I had to describe it in one word it would be Cool, From Samuel L Jacksons speech to John Travolta and Uma Thurmans dance. When all the story lines come together it is magnificent, and it is one of the few films that deserves a 10 star rating.	10
Pulp Fiction - A Masterpiece of Cinema	Portugal	It is one of the most important movies of the 1990s if not ever, because it put Quentin Tarantino on the map as one of the directors to look out for. Pulp Fiction stars Tim Roth, Amanda Plummer, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and many many more and was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Why is Pulp Fiction considered a masterpiece? Because it has really well written dialog  the driving force behind this movie is the dialog, despite all the mob and gangster elements this movie has. If you love superbly written dialog in movies you will probably like Pulp Fiction. From the get going Pulp Fiction you know exactly what movie you are in for  great dialog, a lot of racial slurs and the movie being obscurely original. Instead of running in chronological order from start to finish the movies chapters are all mixed up in a really stylish way. Half of the fun you will have with this movie is piecing the movie together after the first time you watch it. Moreover the characters are awesome as well  Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta make this movie, however they are not the only ones who make the movie great.Another thing that works for Pulp Fiction is the soundtrack. After you watch Pulp Fiction you will have all these songs in your head that will make you buy the soundtrack CD, because they are all so catchy. The songs are also very well edited into the scenes in this movie. A dialog based movie? That should be extremely boring, but in this case it is not  great acting, a great premise, great dialog, it even proves that violence can indeed be funny.	10
One of the best films ever	Germany	I love this movie, it is a perfect mixture of crime, joke and wisdoms (Quarterpounder = Royal Cheese).Since today I have seen this film a dozen times. Cant belief that this film is over 20 years old! In my opinion this is the best Tarantino movie.Every time I can recognize new things. I love the para-language from John Travolta and the black humor from Samuel L Jackson.This movie has three different stories (Vincent Vega and Marsellus Wallace Wife, golden watch and Bonnie situation) with no time chronology. Since today I have no idea what is in the suitcase ;-).	10
The Greatest Film Ever Made	None	This is a Masterpiece. Tarantino changed cinema forever when he created these characters, it is not one individual effort that makes this film what it is however, from the sublime direction to the quick witted script that keeps you on your toes throughout to the phenomenal and underrated performances by John Travolta and Uma Thurman Pulp Fiction is perfection. I went into this film with high expectations, I had recently been introuduced to Tarantino through his previous feature, Reservoir Dogs (which was also very good) and so was anxious to see how he would handle a bigger production with a bigger budget and some of Hollywoods best, Willis, Jackson, Travolta but there was no need to be as I was delivered a masterclass in film. A very simple premise of two mob men dispatched on a daily round evolves into something much more and the with regards to the mystery of the contents of the briefcase, a risky move by Tarantino but it ultimately paid off as people still speculate to this day about it. My belief is it contained his soul. The way in which Tarantino takes these apparently different stories and mixes them together to create some truly spectacular scenes is applaudable to say the least.	10
Love this movie!	Brazil	Well directed, well produced, love the photography, and the script is amazing. Quentin Tarantino is one of my preferred directors, and the Pulp Fiction was the first film from Tarantino that made me start looking different for this directors work. The arc of this script is super well created, once the story connects all the scenes and characters in an order which makes you get into the movie. The photography of this movie is also amazing, very well planned in a way which brings all the atmosphere of the entire movie. The characters are amazing super well acted by this super list of cast. About Tarantinos direction, there nothing that I can tell ... in my opinion this guy is a genius with enough sensibility to put the audience on the right climax, at the right moment. One of the best movies I have ever seen.	10
A Bit Over Rated But Good	United States	I did like pulp fiction to a degree - that is mainly because I love the casting in it: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.The movie is a good crime thriller that all movie lovers should watch. And in some ways the movie does live up to its hype because the story is well written and acted out good too.But, to me, the movie is overrated. It seems that *some* of the people that loves this movie will act/talk like its the only movie worth watching - like it is the King of Films. Yes Pulp Fiction is a very good movie but there are so many great movies to enjoy watching - not just this film.7/10	7
Pulp Fiction?	United States	Does he look like a bitch? proclaims Jules, the character played by Samuel Jackson. Holding a gun in one hand and a suitcase in the other, he repeatedly berates and interrogates his victim. The victim stutters in response. English, motherf*cker, do you speak it? Jules yells again. Vincent (the character played by John Travolta) rests easily on the wall as if this was nothing new to him. Before inevitably killing the poor man, he lashes out another series of vulgar yet shockingly hilarious slur of swears, punch lines, and bible quotes before pulling out his gun and shooting him to death. These quotes are not merely for shock value, and they are spoken in the climax of the movie. They appear within the first 20 minutes of the movie, and are some of the most quotable lines in movie history.This movie isnt intended for children. If the R-rated warning didnt already give that much away. The movie contains many instances of drug use and profanity. Although it is a movie about hit-men and the drug business, the central themes of the movie do not completely center around it. There is a deeper meaning to the movie itself. Not just every violent, gangster drug related movie can make it to top-ten movie lists (IMDB rates it number 5). While this movie is for adults, its also for the more intellectual audience. Morons will be attracted to the movie through its violence and profanity, but intelligent people will walk away with much more. The time line of the movie itself is jumbled and isnt portrayed in the way everything happened, and that alone takes time to figure out. The symbolism of Bruce Williss struggle to get his golden watch is not many will pick up on. Not to mention the symbolic right vs. wrong roles played by Jules and Vincent that inevitably lead to their separate fates. The characters, despite their rash language and dangerous professions all have redeeming qualities and are constructed individually and interestingly. Samuel Jackson, or Jules is more or less the main character who travels around with his companion Vincent doing various tasks for Marsellus Wallace(Played by Ving Rhames). Though all characters carry the same profession, all of them are different in their morals, attitudes, and composure. It doesnt come up until later in the movie, but what separates Jules and Vincent are their decisions whether to stay in the business or leave. This ultimately leads to Vincents death as he chooses to continue his involvement with Marsellus. Jules, being the more superstitious of the two, reaches a moment of clarity early in the time line of the story which enacts him to change his ways as he believes that a higher power is telling him to quit. Vincent and Jules contrast with each other, which in turn makes them the perfect combination. Vincent, more reserved. Jules, more sporadic. Vincent, a heroin addict. Jules, a clean man. Vincent, calm, cool and collected. Jules, loud and controlling. All characters intertwine themselves and hold various attitudes to each other that amount to gore, violence, death, and even rape. No character is looked down up on.The movie itself carries many references to pop culture and the movie is constructed around such. Vincent keeps his hair long and in a pony tail and Jules keeps his in a jerry curl  two styles relevant to earlier times (not to mention these hair styles somewhat reflect their characters). The movie for the most part is fairly present, if not a decade earlier than the year it was produced (1994). The music is mostly older music  from the 1960s and 1970s  and no real original score exists as any music played is from these periods in time. At one point in the movie, Vincent takes Marselluss wife on a date (not a real date, just good company as he puts it) to a 1950s diner where many famous celebrities can be pointed out, such as Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. The music is mostly American rock music, and it is fitting to a story that is very much American.	6
One of the Greatest Dialogues for One of the Greatest Films Ever Made	United Kingdom	Pulp Fiction is the 2nd film directed by one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Quentin Tarantino. It won an Oscar for best dialogue and was beaten for best picture by Forrest Gump.Pulp Fiction tells the story of two mob hit men played by John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson, a mob boss played by Ving Rhames, the mob bosss wife played by Uma Thurman and a boxer played by Bruce Willis. Every single actor/actress in this film plays the role brilliantly especially Samuel L Jackson. The part which makes this film so good is its dialogue. About 90% of this film is just people sitting around talking, but the dialogue is so well written and interesting, you could sit and watch them for hours. This film deserved its Oscar by miles. All those who go into this film expecting lots of shoot outs and explosions, are not going to be impressed due to its long, dialogue heavy scenes.It has no philosophical messages or parts where you need to read between the lines, if you want a film like that, then I suggest you go and watch something directed by Stanley Kubrick. Its a straight up entertaining film which you dont even need to watch all the way through once youve watched it a few times. This film will go down in cinematic history as one of the greatest films of all time. In my opinion, it is the greatest film of all time along with Schindlers List.	10
One of the best movie I ever seen..	Sweden	This movie has is all.. Good actors, good story, and a helluva speed all through the movie.. You will never be bored when watching this movie.. With so many good actors in one movie, you could think that it would not be a good movie. But In my opinion, This is the Best movie John Travolta  Laurent Fishbourne ever acted in.. They both are in their peak performance.. One very cool thing about this movie, is that you may THINK, that you know whats gonna happened next... But believe me, you dont have a clue... I have seen this movie at least 50 times already.. And I could easily watch it 50 times more, without getting bored.. It deserves a BIG 10/10..If you havent seen it, go get a copy immediately..	10
Great Director, Great Movie	United States	Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time. It is not a coincidence, therefore, that Pulp Fiction, one of his most well recognized and known movies, is one of the best movies of all time. Between the eclectic and comedic plot and the supreme group of actors that Tarantino used for the movie, it is inarguable otherwise. For many people, for instance some of my friends who have watched Pulp Fiction, the plot is a negative. These people have got to be Type As who require a structured and well planned plot with a more developed and organized background and character set. They usually think this because the movie simply picks up at different places and is not in chronological order. The movie also introduces characters to the audience without any name, background or insight into the character. These two things can most easily be seen in the beginning and middle of the movie. In the beginning, when the Honey-Bunny scene is introduced for the first time, it is easy for the audience to be dumbfounded and confused as to what the movie is about and who the characters are. The audience may also be confused in the middle of the movie when Marsellus Wallace is talking to Butch. There are no obvious indications as to who the two men are. The audience has to draw from context clues that the black man is Marsellus Wallace and that Butch is a boxer who is supposed to go down for him. It is easy to see that this may irk somebody who has a Type A personality. To me, however, this is a very positive and refreshing aspect of Pulp Fiction. Movies are too predictable today. They present too many known and common variables. All of Quentin Tarantinos movies, or at least most are unpredictable. This unpredictability is refreshing. The randomness, especially in Pulp Fiction, is positive, new and makes watching the movie fun and exciting. Much of the randomness factor in Pulp Fiction comes from random little extras that mean nothing to the plot of the movie. An example of this is when Vince and Mia are on the date and Mia calls Vince a square. But rather than saying square, she outlines a square with her fingers in the air, and lines follow her fingers on the screen. Another random yet comedic part of the movie is when Butch comes home to his girlfriend Fabienne and she says she wants a pot belly. This is where the audience first learns that Fabienne is quite weird and oblivious. Besides these two scenes, there are many other strange little jokes or bizarre piece of humor intertwined into the movie. An excellent example of this is when Butch learns that the watch he receives from his dead fathers comrade was kept inside both of their rectums. Of course the vocabulary Tarantino uses for these for these scenes is quite vulgar, but the vulgarity adds to the hilarity factor. The actors are also part of what makes Pulp Fiction as good a movie as it is. Tarantino usually uses many of the same actors, especially Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken. Thurman plays Mia and Walken plays a more minor role. Besides Thurman and Walken, many acting greats including John Travolta, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson take major roles. In my opinion, Pulp Fiction is the best movie I have seen Bruce Willis play in as he does not play some cheesy, clich character with clich lines like in all the Die Hard movies. John Travolta also plays his role very well, as he also does not take himself too seriously. Samuel L. Jackson, in many aspects is the funniest and best character of the movie. His violent rants and outbursts are hilariously awesome and challenge his famous Go the _____ to Sleep. Pulp Fiction also leaves the audience with questions. The biggest question is what is in the suitcase. All that is known about the contents of the suitcase is that they glow orange and that Marsellus Wallace is the owner and needs them back. The audience also gets to see that anybody looking at the contents freezes and stares when they see what is inside. When I saw the movie for the first time, I thought that the content was gold bars, which may explain the orange glow that hits characters faces when they opened up the suitcase. But, after investigation on the internet, unaware that the subject was of hot debate, I learned that Tarantino wanted the suitcase to hold diamonds, but used diamonds in another movie so he just did not show the contents at all. It is these small mysteries that add interest and debate over the quality of movies. Because of the actors, hilarity, and mystery in Pulp Fiction, it can be considered one of the best movies of all time. Tarantino did not disappoint with this 1994 movie. He intrigued many with a more artist and abstract way of making plots and directing movies.	10
Pure genius!	United States	This is one of my favorite movies of all time. My favorite parts are the characters of Sam Jackson and John Travolta Jules Winfield and Vincent Vega. Quentin Tarantino did a fantastic job. Other movies have tried to compare but none will. My good friend out in Los Angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of Jules and Vincent driving around town and having a discussion about Vincents recent travels abroad. And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that its the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the gold watch speech to Harvey Keitels dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh. He combines utilitarian prose with flights of rough poetry and a wicked fancy.	10
How to make a cool movie	Newcastle, England	Tarantino might not be the best actor in the world and a lot of people just dont like him and his movies full stop but I really do think he has created a master piece when it comes to pulp fiction and if you ever get the chance to watch it in a movie theater take that opportunity with both hands.I think the real reason Tarantino has been able to make such a classic movie is because he is a film fan and only a film fan could have ever put together the pulp fiction movie and made it work, I watched pulp fiction on my 50 plasma screen last weekend probably for the 20th time and it has everything, gangsters, hit men, drugs, comedy, extreme violence but most of all it has COOL this is the movie that makes you feel like smoking or giving up your day job and being someone more interesting...in reality cool is not very cool at all and you most likely end up dead but as far as movies go this is cool.	9
Great	Ukraine	Outrageously violent, time-twisting, and in love with language, Pulp Fiction was widely considered the most influential American movie of the 1990s. Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noise mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La Joete. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic.	10
Art in the film form	United States	The most fantastic movie Ive seen, its going to be considered classic even 100yrs from now. A must watch cult movie that can teach actors and filmmakers the real way to make great art. I have watched this movie tons of times, and each time i watch it i get more in depth of what things actually meant. Also Reservoir of Dogs is very recommended. One of my most favorite movies of all. I am a big fan of filmmaking in general and its very important to watch classics to really put yourself in the mind of the filmmakers at the times when action and horror movies hasnt yet trashed Hollywood. Have Fun watching and Happy Journey!	10
Tarantinos Masterpiece	United States	Zany, witty, funny, stylish, classic and masterful. Pulp Fiction is my favourite film of all time. Its delivers its laughs through phenomenal performances from Uma Therman, John Trovolta, Quentin Tarantino, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson especially. Tarantino is one of the few film-making geniuses that hasnt graced the world with enough of his works. His visual excellence and stylish storytelling techniques are on complete display in this film. Tarantino also gives us an ensemble of characters with flawed and yet unique personalities only Tarantino characters have. His characters are impressive and yet very flawed, very human and yet each and every one of them manages to be ridiculously charismatic and witty. The writing in this film is absolutely flawless, providing one of the most quotable scripts in history. Pulp Fiction is a masterpiece of contemporary cinema that manages to be both effective and enjoyable.	10
nomen est omen	None	When Pulp Fiction hit the theaters it had an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation. And Palme dOr cemented its reputation. Bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. Therefore it was a must see. And after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: Was that it?Some years down the line ive seen more contemporary TV shows from the US and it became clear why Pulp Fiction stood apart. As the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. Why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isnt. There were other things where Pulp Fiction excelled. For example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any CD collection at the end of the 20th century.The way i understood Tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. Although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it.Overall, Pulp Fiction is an exercise in marketing. The title, as well as authors statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. However, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating its reputation to being one of the best movies of all times.	6
Still got it	None	Pulp Fiction has always been up there for me, and it has been a long time since Ive seen this film, but I marvel at its complexity, both in its form and its meaning.When Jules utters lets get into character at the beginning of the film(near the end, depending on how you look at it), Tarentino is forcing us to examine what is fictitious and what is real. His conversion at the end of the movie I think is the triumph of character and virtue over shallowness. He quits killing and decides to wander the earth as so many people of conviction have done(the Disciples of Christ as well as many other historical/religious figures.Moreover, this film is about protecting the dignity of people. While most of the characters are despicable, somehow they manage to save someone else in the film. Examples: When the junkie save Marcellus wife Mia; Butch saving Marcellus from further harm.In the end, Pulp fiction forces you to discern the difference between fact and fiction.	5
Great film.	Suffolk, England	I dont deny that this film is 100% entertainment and the dialogue is solid gold; but that would be nothing without the terrific actors. To be honest, I think the screenplay is massively overrated (although it is commonly cited as one of the best of all-time). It generally mixes ideas from lesser known films and used irrationally to create an ambiance of cool. Though this film is wonderfully cinematic, it mustve been tremendously exciting back when it first premiered. I think its exploitation of violence and drugs is a tragedy, and although these consequences do lead to something bad, it doesnt disencourage them. I cant help but resent the film for the fact its usually the film that gets people into film (cant disagree that it was one of the films for myself, but it has been 7 viewings since) since it offers absolutely nothing new, it just doesnt have a point nor is it a realistic representation of anything - not that Id like to know, to be honest. If it wasnt such a cult film none of the images would recur. It has a pretty flawless soundtrack though. However, I cannot discredit a film for being overrated and what this film does preach does not offend me. I completely understand the acclaim it gets.8/10	8
Master craft film making	United States	To put it simply this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino obviously spent a lot of time carving out this masterpiece. Quentin prides himself on being very talented at writing dialog and he proves it here more than in any other of him films in my opinion. Be warned though this movie is not for the faint of heart as it has sternum puncturing needles, drugs and a lot of violence. But that just adds to the movie for me. The plot lines are masterfully interwoven and the characters are lifelike and very believable. When I turned 40 I did something I always wanted to and rented out a movie theater and the one film that I chose for my friends and I to watch was Pulp Fiction. It is at the top of IMDbs top 250 and it is on AFIs top 100 for a reason, it is master craft film making and it is one of my personal all time favorites.	10
Tribute to On the Waterfront	Toronto, Canada	I have read some of the comments on this website concerning Pulp Fiction and perhaps I missed it but no one has mentioned the fact that Tarantino used an element from Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront in 1954 staring Marlon Brando. In Pulp Fiction, Marsellus Wallace told Bruce Willis that he is supposed to intentionally lose to a boxer named Wilson:Marsellus: In the fifth, your ass goes down. Say it.Butch: In the fifth, my ass goes down.Bruce Willis, not only doesn't go down and lose the fight, he kills Wilson. When I saw this, I became flushed with movie deja vu and felt very satisfied. Why was the boxer called Wilson? In On the Waterfront Marlon Brando has a famous monologue in which he expains how his boxing career ended: He went down intentionally against a boxer named Wilson because of greedy mobsters. Wilson, therefore was the invisble antagonist against Marlon Brando. Tarantino, being a smart guy, knew that in the deep annals of the film buff world, he could redeem Marlon Brando and all us film buffs that hate Wilson more than anything by killing Wilson. If it wasn't for Wilson, Marlon Brando coulda been a contender. So, by killing Wilson forty years later, Tarantino effectively killed off the jerk that ruined Brando's Boxing career in On the Waterfront. I don't know if many people had already realized this but I thought I would bring up to people's attention.Also, for Tarantino fans, watch Kiss Me Deadly (1955) by Robert Aldrich. It has the answer to why the contents of the briefcase, when opened by Travolta, give a glowing lightbeam on Travolta's face and we never see what's inside.	7
Ladies and Gentleman, fasten your safety belts as the cine-bar has been raised!	United States	The first gangster film to make inane yet paralyzing dialog the star of the movie. Brilliant and engaging, endlessly quotable and visually alluring, PF made all the top lists, regenerated John Travolta, solidified Bruce Willis, centered Samuel L. Washington as a leading man and cemented Christopher Walken among creepiest of cameos ever. The side characters are more accessible and reminiscent as friends of ours then they are as plot worthy points of interest. They discuss everyday trivial matters intensely while the viewer is wondering about the ramifications of the events just watched or know is around the corner.... and we actually see very little violence play out! Tarantinos use of the chopped up time line only added to the Pulp mystique as well as its charm. Imbecile gangsters charming? Regressive American social interaction cinema worthy? When combined , it remains a perfect storm for Quintin  company.	10
Classic Pulpy Amusement	Fraggle Rock	Its no surprise that Pulp fiction is a movie that made cinematic history and defined the pulp fiction genre. It features a series of conversations and events coherently, but not chronologically, told. Tarantino tells three different but intertwined stories. Each of the stories are clich&eacute;d and have a noir feel but Tarantino gives them a different and unique treatment and adds sharp witty dialogues full of truth and irony (and references to many classic movies and popular TV shows). He uses a lot of warm colours and the film is slightly sepia tinted. Also theres a lot of attention to intricate detail and it is a finely layered movie such that one discovers something new with every subsequent viewing. Theres also a certain ambiguity about it. Its not certain in which time the film is set or what was it in the briefcase that stunned Ringo...lots of questions and the answers are open for discussion. The cinematography is slick and sharp and the soundtrack is a classic. Then theres the outstanding cast that includes, John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Uma Thurman, Rosanne Arquette, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, Maria de Medeires and Amanda Plummer, all of whom have a magnificent presence and memorable dialogue delivery. There are so many classic scenes that people discuss, even today. My personal favourites are the date sequence (and the scenes that follow) with Travolta and Thurman and the series of conversations between Travolta and Jackson. I doubt theres anything to say about Pulp Fiction that hasnt been said. Whether one likes it or not, this movie is here to stay and even today it is among the most talked about movies. I have already seen it at least four times and it still amuses and fascinates me just like it did during first viewing.	8
A violent, vicious and egregious movie	India	There are movies that open you up, and make you feel relaxed. Some of the movies can give you strength and make you feel hopeful. They are full of messages. But there are some movies, which are just the opposite. They cause a violent feeling within you. After watching those movies you may say to yourself shit! what did I see? That is so vicious! or something similar.It is obvious that I am referring to Pulp Fiction to the second type. I am sure everyone must be shocked by the way the film progressed. The executions, drug consumption, the lifestyles of thugs, conversations etc. are shown in such a raw way that it will make you think for days about the movie and make you say to yourself shit! what did I see?. The movie gave no explicit messages and just had shown lifestyles of certain kind of people. But this no-message story, is shown in such raw and real way that it will make you see and think about this movie again and again. Hats off to direction.Thats why the name :Pulp Fiction	9
Love-Hate:   Been There/Done That	United States	From what I gather, and my own reaction, people either love this movie or hate it. Strangely, I have been on both sides of the fence with this film. I never look at it in the same light, for some reason. At first I hated it and on a second chance, really liked it. Then the same two things happened on the third and fourth viewings until I finally stopped.This is an extremely profane film laced with a lot of dark humor. I have a machine that can filter out much of the profanity and I often appreciate dark humor, but blowing a guy's brains out in the back seat of a car is funny? What am I missing?Two things I will say: the film doesn't lose me despite being two-and-a-half hours. There are no boring lulls and the dialog is fascinating in parts, mainly between John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. Their discussions are unique, to say the least, and one certainly remembers Uma Thurman's role and Travolta slamming a syringe into her chest. With 240 f-words and the Lord's name in vain 28 times, I miss a lot of sentences with the filter. It's still an interesting film.....in a perverse way. The other thing: yes, there is some dark comedy in here but overall this should NOT be labeled a comedy, or God help us all.	6
Energetic and imaginative - making up for it's lack of real heart with a great wealth of dialogue and characters	United Kingdom	Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are thieves who plan their next job whilst drinking coffee in a diner.  Jules and Vincent are hitmen in the employment of top man Marsellus Wallace who must retrieve a stolen suitcase for him.  Butch is a boxer near the end of his career who is ordered to take a dive by Wallace. Mia Wallace is Marsellus' wife who Vincent must show a good time while her husband is out of town.  In a flurry of violence, double crosses and accidents their stories collide in their world of murder, theft and drugs.It is perhaps easier to view this film now than it was when it first came out in the cinema.  At that time the TV schedules were full of interviews with Tarantino and lots of hype.  While it is still considered one of the best films of the 1990's, it is easier to watch it with a fresh eye now. The best film about the film is just how striking each part of it is.  The plot is well constructed in a weave of stories that all stand up well on their own but support other strands.  Often films that jump around within time will be hard to follow but here Tarantino does a great job of not only avoiding this but actually using his structure to propel the film forwards to good effect.The stories are never dull and, although some are better than others, they all pretty much stand up well.  The dialogue in the film could have been annoyingly inane - indeed at points I did tire of the constant pop culture references, but it mostly manages to engage and add to the characters.  It is consistently witty but open to sudden moments of action or violence that are all the more shocking for their suddenness.  There is a point where the film could have been better in the area of emotional involvement.  Most of the violence is met with laughter or interest by the audience rather than real shock or loss; the reason for this is simply that we don't ever really care about the characters on that emotional level - they are players rather than friends.  This is not a major problem as it is something that the pulp genre is happy without and in fairness Tarantino never pretends he is trying to do that.The only other problem with the film is it's glamorisation of both drugs and crime.  This would be a bit of a problem if I wasn't aware of the type of film it was, but I was and I just accepted it; like the man himself said `you don't go to a Metallica gig and tell the f**kers to turn the volume down', so too you don't watch this film expecting it to be anything other than darkly funny, violent and so on.The cast are very good in their various roles; nobody plays it totally straight and they all seem aware that they aren't playing this story in the real world but in a trashy world of pulp fiction hitmen, gangsters and their molls and so on.  Travolta is very good, it's easy to forget now that he had been in the wilderness before this film.  He gives a good performance and manages to make his character likeable without making him pleasant. Jackson impresses more in support and he deserved to win the Oscar that alluded him (`sh*t' he was seen to mouth in place of the usual `oh well done' fake smile!).  His character drive the main part of the film well and is enjoyable.  Willis actually acts here and does well despite not having that much of a range to deliver across.  Thurman is much better here than in Kill Bill and she brings her character to life reasonably well.  Rhames is imposing in his small role and the rest of the cast includes actors such as Whaley, Arquette (times two!), Stoltz, Gallagher, Buscemi, Walken, Greene and a wonderfully enjoyable turn by Keitel.  Tarantino makes a cameo himself and reminds the world why we prefer him not to act, but in fairness he is not as bad as he can be.Overall this is a great film.  It may be a little soulless and cruel if you are not expecting it to be a film that lives up to it's title and is `pulp fiction' but if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it a great deal. The interweaving stories and witty dialogue all keep the film moving forward and, while not a serious or worthy film in any way, it has a great narrative to it and is exciting and enjoyable.	9
the best movie ever	United Kingdom	To contradict my summary line, this film is actually one of the least appealing films I have ever seen. Its violent, disgusting and crude, and none of these are particularly bad traits, its just that it offers me nothing, and leaves me with an emptiness, the fact that I have wasted 2 1/2 hrs watching this, then not to be compensated.This is entirely my opinion, and clearly mine alone. Nearly everyone loves this film, and they are honest enough to clarify it, but if my review is completely the opposite, I still feel compelled to write.Im sorry, but 9th on the list of the top 250 films, seems grossly inappropriate.	1
Honestly, do people talk or behave this way?	USA	Golly, everyone is falling all over themselves about this one.  Why, please? It's silly violent, nihilistic, pointless.  And every character has the same way of talking -- talking about clever things in that pseudo-way that only Quentin could possibly dream up.  Ooooooh, the talent! Pass.	1
Disgusting	Cologne, Germany	This is one of those movies (like Fargo) which expects the audience to laugh about the most cruel scenes of violence. That's not only disgusting but even dangerous, because in spite of It's only a movie, you know we all should know how influential screen behaviour might be, don't we?	1
worst movie ever	U.S.	After 4 years, I still consider this the worst movie I have ever seen.  I have yet to watch any thing else with QT's name attached to it. Everything about this film is annoying, (the presence of the ubiquitous Sam Jackson and Steve Buscemi, the weak attempts at shock value, the cameo by the director) but the one element that makes this number one on my all time worst list is the obnoxious dialogue that tries to be hip and funny.  THREE'S COMPANY reruns have better dialogue (and I hate that show). It's such a shame though, because QT and I do have a lot of the same obscure tastes in movies. My advice is to try a project that tries not to be shocking, funny or hip, because PULP FICTION fails in all three departments miserably.	1
You have to be a Himmatwala to watch Himmatwala	United Arab Emirates	You need to be brave, courageous and strong to watch this Movie. This more like a Torture than an Entertainer. Sajid Khan Claimed that this is the best movie he made. HE must visit a Doctor. Ajay Devgn shouldn&#x27;t sign movies which are remakes. It&#x27;s sad and disappointing to see a fantastic actor losing his track by doing these crap Masala movies. Well Now for the Movie Direction : It&#x27;s weak and not worth commenting. This worst Sajid Khan&#x27;s Movie ever. Dialogues are average. Looks like a 10 year old wrote it.Performances : Ajay Devgn tries hard but the script is awful. Ajay Is just okay. He looks convincing though. He has a one or two good scenes but that &#x27;s not enough. Tamannaah Bhatia is wasted . She is beautiful and has a screen presence but she is more like a Talking Doll. Mahesh Manjrekar is good. Paresh Rawal is the SAVING GRACE of the movie. His performance will make you laugh. Rest of the cast is purely average.Music : The original was famous for it&#x27;s music and it&#x27;s dance set pieces. The music isn&#x27;t great expect the 2 songs &#x22;Taki Taki&#x22; and &#x22; Naino Mein Sapna&#x22;. But the choreography is AWFUL.There are 2 item songs. Not Great.Action : It&#x27;s over the ROOF TOP. Senseless to be frank. Overall : It&#x27;s a Waste of time. Better watch &#x22;JOLLY L.L.B&#x22; or &#x27;Mere Dad Ki Maruti&#x27; Wait for It : It has A TIGER!!!! AJAY DEVGN FIGHTS WITH A TIGER AND WINS!!! YES A TIGER!!! OHH GOD WHY???0.5/5This is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!This movie can can be Compared his Sister&#x27;s with Tees Maar Khan and His Brother-in-Law&#x27;s Joker.	1
Insult to the humanity/movie lovers....please ban this guy from making movies	NYC, United States	I usually do not write reviews as I do not have time to do so. But for this movie, I am still in shock and could not resist to register and write a review. Sajid Khan, as always is the worst director and a movie maker in the bollywood industry ( may be in the entire world). While watching the movie, I could not believe what I was watching. The movie was so pathetic that I was ashamed on myself for watching it. My confidence level has really gone down after watching this movie. Sajid Khan needs psychiatric treatment with shock therapy. I wish there is a class action law suit against him for making such movies, for mental torture and making people feel idiots. I urge everyone to watch this movie so everyone in the world must know how pathetic, poor, terrible, shameless director this guy is. but please do not spend money for this movie.	1
One of the Worst Bollywood Movie u will ever see	New Delhi	Help me guys. Rate this shi*t 1/10 and throw pup on Sajid Khan&#x27;s face.Also thumb up the review so everyone can see only one line and save their time._______________________________Cant believe why Ajay and Pervesh would do such a film. This movie make Tees Maar KHan and Joker award winning movies. Hope Akshay don&#x27;t do his films in future. He thinks all of us are jokers wating to get fooled.Only Good thing is songs (those reused)are reasonablly well. Tamanaah look very good but cant be said about her acting.Cant believe why Ajay and Pervesh would do such a film. This movie make Tees Maar KHan and Joker award winning movies. Hope Akshay don&#x27;t do his films in future. He thinks all of us are jokers wating to get fooled.	1
Insult to Human Logic	Bangalore, India	Climax scene, very intense. Son (Ajay Devgan) is getting beaten inside a temple compound by villains in front of his mother, sister and girlfriend. Mother, finally enters into temple and pleads to god &#x22;Bas Maa Bas, Aur Kab Tak&#x22;.Entire cinema hall bursts into laughter! I doubt there can be any bigger insult to a movie maker than this - he is trying to create an emotional scene and viewer is getting comedy out of it. If I could, I&#x27;d request govt to consider giving out some sort of award - not to the movie, but to the viewers for going through this tormenting, nerve-racking, torturous assault on human logic. I wish I could get my money back and sue the director for wasting my 2 hours.Well, this was probably the most confused movie I have ever seen. The treatment is pathetic and the entire movie is shot casually without any brains. It being a remake of an old movie (well, almost all the decently launched Hindi movies now a days are either remake of some Tamil / Telugu / Kannada / Hollywood film or some sequels like Murder 3, Jism 3, Race 2, Saheb Biwi and Crap returns, Ashiqui 2, Yamala Pagla Deewana 2 etc) always brings additional expectation of it to be slightly better than the earlier one. Not with this one. Forget being better, if Jitendra sees it, he might contemplate killing himself for approving such a shady remake.Movie starts with a street fight which is idiotically shot. Then suddenly jumps to a railway station called Ramnagar. Ajay Devgan gets down from the train with dress and shades of 2013 for a movie which supposedly is of 1980s. Meets mother - mothers tells some senseless story - they move in to their home and starts taking revenge on villain. I guess my narration of story is far better than how Sajid Khan has managed to display it.Presence of Paresh Rawal doesn&#x27;t help with comic quotient of the movie. Its ridiculously meaningless - but I guess we must have gotten used to it by now with Houseful and Houseful 2. I am yet to figure out why Sajid Khan is loosing his brain with each movie he is releasing. Hey Baby was a much better entertainer and after that, he seemingly has lost his sane in making movies.The tiger fight scene is absurd and nonsensical. In 2013, where CGI is so far advanced, the entire stretch is shot as if the director is running on budget crunch. Guess, it is more of a intellect-crunch at directors end than anything else.Well, not everything is bad in this movie. There are two good things - call them eye soothing if you wish - Tamannah, who simply looked fabulous, and 5 beauties dancing on &#x22;Dhoka Dhoka Dhoka&#x22; item song. The song is ludicrous (like rest of the songs and the movie itself), but I guess having 5 item girls helped a bit to glorify the screen.Should you watch this movie? Well, go ahead if you want to see how an illogical movie is made to abuse human brain. I lost my senses after watching this movie and had to wait 24 hours before I could gain some of it to write this apt review.In my opinion, you&#x27;ll be much better off sipping some drink and enjoying a biryani with that money in some decent restaurant than wasting it here. If you are not hungry, give that money to some beggar for god&#x27;s sake, better than wasting on it. You would not miss anything in life if you haven&#x27;t watch it - trust me!	1
Himmatwala is not worth a ticket.	India	I clearly remember when I first saw the trailer of Himmatwala and at the end of it written A Sajid Khan Entertainer, I was sure that another trash from sajid&#x27;s kitty is going to see the daylight and this time I promised not to watch the movie in theater at least. Then finally i watched it in my Laptop and i was so happy that Sajid khan didn&#x27;t prove me wrong.Each and every scene and the nuances of each character&#x27;s depiction was so silly, unfunny and annoying that i completed the movie within 1 hr and 10 mins.The shocking thing was how could an actor like Ajay Devgn&#x27;s caliber sign a nonsense movie like this? just for the sake of 100 Cr moolah that could make a hat trick other two being Bol Bachchan and SOS. Tamannah, please go back to south and if Trisha fails to grab a position in Bollywood, then of course you can&#x27;t. Again as there are so many other bimbos flying high with success with khans without knowing acting then chances to sizzle on bollywood screen gets higher courtesy Sajid Khan.Sorry Jacqueline Fernandez. And yes Sajid, as you hate critics, so let me tell you am no critic and love Hindi films but know the difference between good and bad.And yes in a recent reality show where you were one of the judges,you were saying repeatedly &#x22; Your performance is like Sajid Khan&#x27;s Blockbusters&#x22; gone horribly wrong at least from the multiplex collections of Himmatwala. And Multiplex audiences are more of a class. Rest You can think yourself..Please No Himmatwala 2....EARNEST REQUEST!!!	1
I dont want to believe this movie Really exists	United Kingdom	From The First day when I have seen first time seen trailer of this movie I know this was going to be a bad one. but My kid (5 year old is Big fan of the Singham...Mean ajay devgan with mucchhe) insist me a lot after seeing trailer with lion fight.I knew it was bad by the looks of it from a fifteen-minute review, but I wasn&#x27;t fully convinced. This movie COULDN&#x27;T be as bad as Ram Gopal Vermas AGG, right?? Boy, was I proved wrong.This isn&#x27;t of course an exact copy of Old Himmatwala (1983... I even don&#x27;t like that one too).... The director makes freewheeling changes both in terms of characters and situations. But no amount of tweaking can do much to save this piece of tawdry twaddle from being a complete washout.My massala Movie gore kid who even enjoy crap like RA-one, Is come out of Hall Silenced as he have seen ghost! Avoid this movie at all costs. Unless you like to watch movies that will give you headaches and begin to question humanity in this world, then knock yourself out. But other than those people, don&#x27;t waste your time. 150 minutes will be wasted from you if you dare watch this.The end.	2
Pathetic simply pathetic	Pakistan	I just wasted 2 hours of my life for this crap. After seeing Joker and Tees Mar Khan i was expecting that those were the worst things ever happened to me but boy , Sajid Khan proved me wrong. This crap is senseless and a torture to anyone . U must be a real himmatwala to watch himmatwala (bullshit). Sajid Khan please use some logic before releasing a torture cell. Do not waste your time and money . Acting by each and everyone in the movie is pathetic. Ajay Devgan disappointed me a lot . Im a huge fan of him but he is a total waste in this movie. Direction from Sajid Khan is too bad. I think he was confused while making this movie and did not know what to do . Tamanna Bhatia is beautiful but her acting was not up to the mark. Paresh Rawal is way out of his own league in this flick. In a nut shell this movie is going to be the biggest flop of this year.	1
HIMMATWALA is the one who can watch this movie second time...	India	I usually don&#x27;t watch such movies but I don&#x27;t know what it was that convinced me to watch this one... The movie touched each and every aspect of boredom. In fact, the movie sets a new benchmark in the field of irksomeness. The movie starts with a song featuring Sonakshi. Well, no comments on that. Then comes a (practically impossible)fight scene. There you get a glimpse of what this movie is going to be. Then comes Paresh Rawal&#x27;s character. The character played by this great actor was the most irritating, annoying, aggravating, abrading (idk add some more words) character I had ever seen in my entire life. The same goes with Mahesh Manjrekar&#x27;s character. Ajay&#x27;s and Tamanna&#x27;s characters were so-so. Now, Good and bad aspects of this film: BAD- 1. &#x27;Dangerously&#x27; uninteresting story. 2. Super Boring songs. 3. Irritating comedy. 4. Impractical fight sequences. GOOD- ... ...(plz suggest if you find some)The movie has the potential of making you feel like going home (multiple times). This movie, as rightly said in the other review, &#x22;questions humanity in this world.&#x22; Sajid Khan himself is not capable of watching movies like this (provided it is not made by him). But this movie can be used as &#x27;an April fool&#x27;s day prank&#x27;. You can tell your friend that the movie is awesome and send him to watch this piece of s***...And I&#x27;m sure your friend will never forget that...P.S.-You still go to watch this movie after reading this....then you are an IDIOT	1
bad totally bad movie of this year	India	this is not at all good movie compare to sajid khans previous movies. this movie is tool long .only good thing about this movie is its remake of 1983 movie - himatwala.this movie is full of stupidity comedy which does not make audience laugh at all.i would give 1 and half out of 5. Fashioned exactly on the same story as its 1983 saga, the story is typical of that era.I don&#x27;t think anyone except Sajid Khan could have found the script of Himmatwala interesting.In the film, perhaps the most notable moment was Ajay&#x27;s fight sequence with the tiger that leapt out straight from the sets of Ang Lee&#x27;s Life of Pi.Personally, the film made me miss the intense and passionate actor Ajay Devgn was, before mindless comedies got the better of him! He is obviously way more Himmatwala than Jeetendra was and performs his stunts with inexplicable exhibition of power and strength.	1
Himmatwala:A Idiotic piece of work by Sajid Khan in the name of  Entertainment!	Bahrain	Himmatwala directed by Sajid Khan is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen.The 1983&#x27;s Jeetendra-Sridevi&#x27;s Himmatwala was entertaining while 2013&#x27;s Ajay Devgn-Tammanah&#x27;s Himmatwala is horror offered to the audience in the name of entertainment.While the movie has a running time of 150 minutes,I could not endure this nonsense for more than an hour and I had to leave the theater!The action sequences,too,are boring,because they are the same repetitive action scenes which we have seen in many movies before.The direction by Sajid Khan is done to death.The screenplay is badly written.The music is sonorous.The dialogs written by Sajid-Farhad are awful.Performances: Ajay Devgn is strictly okay.Tamannah overacts.Mahesh Manjrekar is fine.Asrani hams and is wasted in a small role.Special mention of Paresh Rawal,who steals the show with his fabulous performance!All in all,Himmatwala directed by Sajid Khan is an Idiotic piece of work presented to the audience in the name of Entertainment!I am giving it a generous one on ten(Solely for Paresh Rawal). A Disappointment!	
Is this the WORST out of the sajids AEGEAN stables......nah dont think so !!!!	India	the first existential question that arises after watching this movie is whether this trite is worth reviewing....the answer was an overwhelming NO,then i thought of the snotty and obnoxious manner in which the sibling director duo has been panning all and sundry in their movies and in award ceremonies.The so called TALENTED DUO has been directing some pathetic movies such as housefull,joker etc.Himmatwala, the latest in the khan assembly line production is another DUD in the offing.It seems no one is advising the all knowing brother sister duo to clean their stinking Aegean stables once and for all.Himmatwala amply displays that Sajid khan is no director.....he&#x27;s merely a mimic harbouring gargantuan ambitions.SORRY.....but thats what the dirty rotten truth is !!!!!!	1
Need Himat to watch Himatwala	None	This is overconfidence of Sajid that he knows how to make 100 cr from movies.These days everyone is making their life time worst movies. Ram gopal verma ki AAG, Farah Khan - Joker, Sajid - Himatwala.Don&#x27;t watch this movie, I stopped it after 30 mins and I haven&#x27;t laughed once :).So all the best if you dare to watch ;)IMDb should have 0 star or 1/2 star option.Now i can really understand the 1 star movie.Don&#x27;t know why critic gave it 2 starswaiting for good one..	1
After watching this movie Now i can say i am real Himmatwala	India	The problem with Sajid Khan&#x27;s &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; is the director can&#x27;t make-up his mind whether he wants to make a spoof or whether he wants to recreate the nostalgia of the 1980s. The film thus hangs in a precarious balance vacillating between the two extremes.Ravi (Ajay Devgn) is a street fighter who discovers that his widowed mother and sister are in dire straits in his native village. He returns to Ramnagar to avenge the death of his father and seek justice for the people of his village. Sher Singh&#x27;s (Mahesh Manjrekar) daughter is equally spoiled and walks around the village in very small dresses, brandishing a whip. The spoilt brat soon falls for Himmatwala Ravi and is then swishing around in salwar-kameez plotting her father&#x27;s downfall.A very typical Bollywood revenge saga like this one in the hands of a better director could have become a laughter riot. Sajid Khan however, hopelessly grapples with the treatment finally completely losing track by the climax. The dialogue-baazi quite often doesn&#x27;t have the desired effect, the action sequences look very Rohit Shetty style and the humour falls flat quite often. Even Ajay realizes that his jokes are not that funny and even mentions it more than once in the film.What works for the film is basically Ajay who seems completely convinced with the flimsy script. It&#x27;s as if his presence is enough to make the film a Rs 100 crore enterprise. Tamannaah looks good and shows enough flawless skin in the &#x27;Tathaiya Tathaiya&#x27; and &#x27;Taki Taki&#x27; song, to ensure they will become the most popular songs of the year.Why we start the film with the &#x27;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&#x27; song or why we suddenly throw in a totally redundant item song, is completely beyond comprehension. Farah had very deftly handled the rebirth saga and turned it on its head in &#x27;Om Shanti Om&#x27; to deliver a complete entertainer, unfortunately Sajid completely fails to do the same.	2
The worst film can get	Pune	The worst the worst film ever, i won;t spend even a single rupees for this pit film. Sajid Khan feels he is the best director of the film industry but he should knows this that he is the worst in all. He doesn&#x27;t have any writing sense or directing sense. I wonder why great actor like Ajay Devgan is doing such films like this and wasting his talent. It is pitiful that a national award winning actor that does film like Bhagat Singh can do Himmatwala. Already i disliked the original film but how could the makers even think of remaking it on such a heavy budget. I think as this has gone flop the director will now take few years to come back just as his sister&#x27;s brother. It&#x27;s funny film for the makers not the film.	1
It will raise a big question on the intellect of 21st centurys Indian viewers  their choice of entertainment if this becomes another notable Hit of 2013.	India	Remembering the day, when I first heard Sajid Khan announcing an official remake of Jeetendra, Sridevi starrer HIMMATWALA released in 1983, I was really shocked since it was not a great film in terms of content despite of being a big hit in those tough years. Now the phrase &#x27;those tough years&#x27; has been used here, since the decade of 80s is apparently considered to be the most forgettable, amateurish and indecisive decade of Bollywood in the history of its 100 years of film- making as far as the commercial films are concerned. So making a remake of a film selected from that era was quite strange and weird to accept all of a sudden. Yet considering the successful track record of Sajid Khan, I thought that probably he might have cracked some worth trying comic idea within the same storyline and maybe would come up with something interesting rediscovering the 80s in his own version.But surprisingly it was really unacceptable to find that Sajid does nothing of that sort in his over-hyped film to please the new age viewers and just sticks to the same old melodramatic script full of all clich&#xE9;d plots not appealing to the present net generation at all. Now here an important question arises, that if one really is willing to see a film chosen from that forgotten era of the 80s, then he can easily opt for the original only, which at least would provide him the feeling of that &#x27;Pleasant Nostalgia&#x27; watching the jumping jack, Jeetendra and the owner of thundering thighs, Sridevi along with the incomparable witty Kader Khan performing at their best. And if he can easily get to see the film on the net just for free or on a DVD for only a few rupees then why on earth he would like to see the same outdated acts being performed by the present big stars at a cost of a high priced ticket?In other words, if Sajid simply assumed that the viewers in 2013 will really be amused to see Ajay Devgan deliberately doing all those over the top fights and emotional sequences without any contemporary touches or favourable changes introduced, then he was gravely mistaken in doing so, because the films utterly fails to make any kind of entertaining or emotional connect of that sort with the viewers in its pretty long length of 150 minutes. And the same can also be said for its entire cast too wherein Ajay Devgan looks like a clown performing in that peculiar style of the 80s hero, Tamannajust manages to look beautiful awfully speaking &#x22;I hate Gareebs&#x22; in a childish tone and one truly feels pity seeing an extremely gifted actor Paresh Rawal performing such a silly act wearing a horrible wig. To add further Sajid&#x27;s own self praised film falls completely flat in its soundtrack department too with the remixed tracks missing the required bubbly spirit and the fresh songs simply falling into the category of below average. However the cinematography does try to give you something to watch and so does the background music desperately trying to pump up the blood at regular intervals.Further replying to the bragging statements given by the director weeks before the release of his film I would like to say that for me neither Ajay&#x27;s entry had anything exceptional to cheer for nor I could appreciate the stupid spoof played on Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s cult classic PSYCHO. So, if Sajid is firm on his statement of paying back the ticket amount to those who didn&#x27;t feel like clapping on Ajay&#x27;s entry in the film, then probably he would have to spend a lot paying many like-minded friends disagreeing to his assurances given like myself. In addition I also have another question for the director that if he was really making a film for that common man of the interiors who comes into the theater just for his escapist entertainment, then why were the few subtitles shown in the film written in English and not Hindi?Anyway, coming to the only silver lining in this black cloud, I would like to mention its two action sequences with the TIGER which easily transported me back to those years when we eagerly used to wait for a tiger fight in a film particularly the ones featuring the Garam Dharam. May be the kids would enjoy this more than the mature audiences which might become the only saving grace of the film to sustain in the home video market. Nevertheless, the truth remains that while watching the tiger in this bad remake, I just had the famous slogan in mind in a different form which said, &#x22;Save This Tiger&#x22; instead of &#x22;Save The Tiger&#x22; ironically.Summing up, one really needs guts to see this HIMMATWALA made with some questionable expectations by the makers, religiously following its outdated original of the past lacking the much needed appeal for the current generation.	1
Sajid Khan needs a life	India	Sajid Khan ought to learn that being humble will help him survive not ego and showing off The arrogance he showed during the interviews proved that he thinks himself as a numero uno, after the success of his last 3 films he had the reasons and he thought he can take audiences for granted but he was proved wrong. The film is a remake of Himmatwala(1983) but barring the main plot(which is changed a lot) and some scenes the film is different from the original Sajid Khan minuses some characters like the mute guy, Shoma Anand, Asrani&#x27;s role from the original and adds new characters here In the original, Ravi was an engineer here he is a street fighter. Even the twist at the interval is different here The film however reminds us of the bad films made in 1980s and is cringe worthy to the say the least. Sajid Khan claimed that if people don&#x27;t clap at Ajay&#x27;s entry he will give the money back, and the entry is one of the best ever seen but sadly it isn&#x27;t. In the film, Ajay keeping into the trend of Son of Sardar does all Rajnikant type jigs like breaking the lock with his bare hands, fighting with a badly CG enhanced tiger, bending a rod.etc He also has to dance and compete with Jeetendra and he is a laugh riot The film has all the masala and everything that we wanna forget of the past. Sadly now days filmmakers have found a new mantra to success, rehashing old masala in the name of tribute, but sadly it is a farceDirection by Sajid Khan is nothing great Music by Sajid Wajid is ordinary, Naino Mein Sapna sung by Kishore&#x27;s son Amit Kumar and Shreya Ghoshal is well choreographed but lacks the zing of the original(obviously Ajay is no Jeetu and Tamannah is no Sridevi), Taaki sung by Mika and Shreya also isn&#x27;t that great The new songs Bum Pe Laat is ordinary and also Dhokha Action scenes are nothing greatAjay Devgn ought to change his script selection, he does a good job as usual, but sadly the actor in him is restricted, after all he has to please the chawani crowd but doing such films will not help him anywhere else.His dances are very bad Tammannah makes her comeback to bollywood after a debacle Chand Sa Roshan Chehra that released in 2005 and also starred another forgotten d&#xE9;butante Samir Aftab and then she went south and got famous, her acting isn&#x27;t anything great Mahesh Manjerekar tries to fit in Amjad Khan&#x27;s shoes but isn&#x27;t that effective, he doesn&#x27;t resort to his now trademark hamming but he is average Paresh Rawal does a mimicry of Kader Khan, amalgamating 2 roles of Kader Khan, Bhajrangi from Ghar Ho To Aisa(1990), he keeps speaking to the camera and the other from the original and he is good at times but overdoes it too often. Amongst rest Zarina Wahab repeats her Agneepath act and is getting typecast, we fear she may become the next Rakhee Adhyanan Suman is plastic in a role done by Shakti Kapoor in the original. Asrani who was in the original too is as usual rest are all okay	1
Himmatwala is a threequel to TEES MAAR KHAN and JOKER !!! Thanks to Sajid Khan	India	When you remake a classic 80&#x27;s movie , you carry a big responsibility of living up to the audience&#x27;s expectation. Himmatwala carries of the genre of 80&#x27;s era but falls flat on the face with horrible direction and over- top-performance.Ravi( Ajay Devgan) returns to his village after 20 years to avenge his father&#x27;s murder from a cruel and heart-stoned Sher Singh ( Mahesh Manjrekar).Director of somewhat-OK Heyy Baby and pathetic Housefull series, Sajid Khan made of a fun of himself and the movie which will give you nothing but severe headache once you will leave the theater. The running time of 2.30 hrs does seems elongated with a pale script which has more loopholes than the government services. Have not we witnessed such kind of story in India cinema before ? When you have so many talents and creativity this year for trying out something new , you have a film like Himmatwala which is a reflection of bad light in Bollywood. Worst scenes include the spoof on Psycho ( yes you heard it right) - the classic scene where a woman in shower is murdered by a stranger, the fight scene between tiger and Ajay Devgan , the chemistry between Tamanna and Devgan - the list is endless. I feel bad for actors like Ajay Devgan and Paresh Rawal wasting their talents in film like this. Music is irritating . Cinematography is good. Art direction nice depicting the era of 80&#x27;s very well. Performance by other stars are insignificant. Overall , a bad film at every aspect. Sajid Khan completes the series of disaster right after TEES MAAR KHAN , JOKER and now HIMMATWALA.	1
Great story, disaster movie	London, England	On the surface, it has the potential for a great film; a poor family being grossly mistreated by a local wealthy landowner resulting in the death of the father and the getting away of the son.Several years later, the deceased son&#x27;s closest friend returns to that village to get things right.Yet, despite the pedigree of the main story, the powers that be decided to make a B film, or even C, out of it. Tacky, tasteless it falls short of expectation.Even when this is somewhat improved on the second half it is not enough to save this whereby had it not been for the moral of the story I would have walked out the theatre long before it was over.Perhaps I ought to see the 1983 original.	2
Himmatwala Review- An old fashioned but entertaining film	india	Movie: Himmatwala Rating: 4/5After seeing my rating, most of you will think why I did this. Actually, I liked this movie. I did not find a reason to dislike it at all. Except of the fact that the film is a bit old fashioned, there is nothing bad, its an entertainer.Himmatwala, in other words, has a good story, screenplay, performances, comedy, action, music etc as per the hype. Ajay Devgn does his role with perfection as always. He is able to do full justice with the character. Tamannaah is not only cute and beautiful, but acts as well. In fact, her performance is the best in the movie. Others also do well. The songs are good and manage to recreate the retro feel. The action scenes are well choreographed and performed, they are the ones to come up with perfection after a long time. The story is good and also some emotional scenes are also well enacted.On the whole, Himmatwala is an entertainer, without any negatives, but if you have to watch it, be sure you haven&#x27;t watched the original one first, just like me!	8
Stay As Far as Possible from Sajid khan Film!!!	Bangladesh	I remember Sajid khan made an statement prior release this film where he claim HIMMATWALAWill be the biggest hit of the year. That is my only guide to this movie and it was a massive blunder To trust this unabashed, dismal guy! I just lost my word after 10-15 minute &#x26; wonder whether cry or laugh!!The jokes was awful, unbearable&#x85;I never seen any 1 try this hard to make audience laugh and yet him/her Become ridicule. There was no story at all, Emotional seen make you laugh even more than joke, action seen were ridiculous,Better suit to a comic hero than film hero (slap a Tiger!!!).Heroine looks good in all songs but acting left lot to desire,Ajay must be ripping his hair off for his decision to sign this film..he could easily do without a sloppy role such as this. All I can say about sajid khan is he is a big NOTHING, a big disaster, a shameless, brainless, useless, hopeless fellow! Even Sajid &#x26; his family member could not watch this nightmare for 2/3 Hour let alone audience. If any 1 even thinking Of watching this movie just FORGET it, even if some 1 pay you to watch..now you know how bad is this movie!!!	1
Text book example! how not to do a movie!	Cambridge, UK	Usually I don&#x27;t mind no brainer entertainers at least they bring some smile on your face. I am not going to comment on story because lack of it was expected as I knew I was going to watch Sajid Khan&#x27;s movie. But this movie didn&#x27;t even do justice even with its genre. There was only one good joke and that was on save the tiger which was already running TV adverts day in and day out. If Sajid Khan didn&#x27;t come with a good movie anytime soon then this might be his career&#x27;s last. I reckon that everyone from film crew who must have seen pre-screen should have stopped the movie. If projects turn out to be so bad then it should be benched.	1
U need a lot of (himmat) courage  to sit thru this one.....	Bangalore, India	The 1980s were the dark ages of Hindi Cinema. The worst films came from there. Actually, its very easy for any person to make a list of the 10 best Hindi films of the 80s (due to lack of competition) and a difficult task to make a list of the 10 worst Hindi films of the 80s (due to heavy competition).The original Himmatwala belonged to no mans land. It was neither good nor bad....OK for the 80s. But hats off to Sajid Khan, he ensure the remake will hands down appear in the list of the worst films of this decade.What was Sajid Khan smoking while writing this movie?? Frankly, he is an idiot who thinks he makes gr8 cinema. Sorry Sajid but every time crap can&#x27;t make money at BO. I&#x27;ve no words to describe this film and had lost my senses by the time it got over. Many yrs ago, In &#x27;Yaadien&#x27; to make Hrithik and Kareena fall in love, the legendary Subhash Ghai used a crocodile. Guess what, Sajid uses a tiger...yup !! And he goes a step further. In the climax, when Devgn&#x27;s character is being beaten up and his mother calls for help, the same tiger reappears and saves Devgn. Yup !! U have to see it to believe it.I really don&#x27;t know why Devgn who such a brilliant actor is doing such crap. And over the years, he staring in crap films like Golmaal series, Rascals, Son of Sardar and now Himmatwala is baffling. The original worked because Amjad Khan, Kader Khan and Jeetendra shared some good on screen chemistry. Nothing works here.My sincere advise...if u want to watch Devgn, watch him in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam or Company or even Singham. And if want to watch a tiger on screen, then Life of Pi is a far better choice.	2
Himmat Wala - A Tribute To Amitabh and Not To Jetendra	Karachi, Pakistan	Before reviewing the new Himmatwala, allow me to introduce you with some facts related to 1983&#x27;s Himmatwala. K. Raghavendra Rao&#x27;s Himmatwala (1983) was an experimental film, in which he signed a sinking mega-star of early 1980&#x27;s Jetendra, whose movies were drowning deeply at the box office back in those days. Similarly, Sridevi was signed because of limited budget as she was planning to leave the industry because of constant flops. On the contrary, Kader Khan, who used to play negative roles, was also not getting any movies. The concept of remakes of south Indian movies was also fresh at that period of time. So, all in all, it was their hard work and commendable script with astounding performances which made Himmatwala a fare that not only started the team (Jetendra, Sridevi, Kader Khan, Amjad Khan, Shakti Kapoor and Asrani) to launch numerous block-busters but also gave a reason to copy it even after 3 decades. Sajid Khan&#x27;s Himmatwala is a literal copy of the original Himmatwala. Although, he has mentioned at many platforms that his movie has a few elements of the original one but if you see the original movie, dialogues, character names, scenes and at places background score have also copied from it. There are minor amendments which add no weight to the movie.If Sajid Khan says that this particular movie is a tribute to 1980&#x27;s cinema then he should rephrase it as a tribute to the &#x22;Young Angry Man&#x22; of 1980&#x27;s Amitabh&#x27;s movies. The reason to quote this is that 5 action scenes from this movie reminded me of Amitabh&#x27;s movies. A &#x96; Title Track reminded me of Shan&#x27;s &#x22;Pyar Karnewalay Pyar Kartay Hain Shaan Se&#x22;, filmed on Parveen Babi. B &#x96; Cage fight of Ajay Devgan made me recall Amitabh&#x27;s cage fight from Naseeb. C &#x96; The scene where Ajay Devgan holds the dagger from sharp end while saving his sister from &#x22;Dhanna&#x22;, reminds me of the scene from &#x22;Kaala Patthar&#x22; where Amitabh did the same with a character named &#x22;Dhanna&#x22; (played by Ashok Saxena). D &#x96; The much talked about tiger fight again makes me recall Amitabh&#x27;s tiger fight from &#x22;Khoon Pasiina&#x22;. E &#x96; The fight sequence just before the song &#x22;Bump Pe Laat&#x22; where Ajay converses in 5 different languages with goons gives me a vivid remembrance of a similar scene from Amitabh&#x27;s &#x22;Laawaris&#x22;Anyways, the plot is similar and it tells a story of a malicious Sarpanch Sher Singh (Mahesh Manjrekar) who defames Ravi&#x27;s (Ajay Devgan) father to an extent where he commits suicide and his family suffers a lot of pain. Years after, Ravi returns to take revenge from Sarpanch. I am a fan of 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s movies, this was the mere reason why I chose to watch the new Himmatwala but experience was nothing but sheer pain. First of all, Ajay looks totally misfit for the role; he failed to pass the wittiness which Jetendra portrayed in his style. His &#x22;Atta Maajhi Sattakli&#x22; style has now stuck to him &#x96; its time to come up with something original and much entertaining. Mahesh Manjhrekar is a very talented actor but he looks cheap and acts loud in this fare. Even he failed to meet Amjad Khan&#x27;s comical expressions and terrifying persona. Adhyayan Suman as Shakti does not even come close to Shakti Kapoor in a single scene. Tamanna Bhatia (a renowned and successful Tamil actress) has screen presence but when it comes to performing, she needs to focus on that. The only character that stands out (to some extent) in the movie is Paresh Rawal (enacting the role of Kader Khan). He manages to copy the appearance and tone of Kader Khan and with his dialogues, his earnest attempt is visible in every scene. Asrani is the only actor who has appeared in both the Himmatwalas but in the newer version he is wasted. Ritesh Deshmukh appears in a cameo and he is as usual &#x96; typical. Zarina Wahab is efficient. It&#x27;s saddening that this film has great performers and super stars but even then the film failed to create a magic at the box office.If you really want to get heavy dose of entertainment watch the original one.Rating 3.5 / 10	3
entertainer	new delhi	The Film is a remake of the 1983 blockbuster &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; *ing Jeetendra &#x26; Sreedevi.Ajay Devgan as Ravi did a great job, except in dance sequences. The punch lines, fights, ferocity in the eyes etc hit the bulls eye. Tamanna looked beautiful but needs to work on her acting skills..Paresh Rawal,was great nd was really entertaining..Zarina Wahab was good, so is Leena Jumani, Ajay&#x27;s sister! Junior Suman as usual wasted, mahesh manjerakar was a biggest disappointment, he was total misfit , he lacked that cruelness nd even comic sense which was expected..	10
80s Reloaded has some good moments	nz	I have seen the Jeetu starring Himmatwala. And i have to admit the kind of humor and typical humor of 80&#x27;s. It has been captured well and reincorporated in this project by Sajid Khan. In my opinion because the audience has grown from 80s and has become more mature. It might seem too lengthy or boring or senseless. But that is how movies of 80;s were at that time. If you have patience and if you were charmed by 80s era. You will absolutely love the movie and think of it as a visual delight. Humour fun and lot of drama with fantastic comedy scenes. Music has been themed after 80&#x27;s era as well. Very peppy and upbeat music although fewer songs would have done more justice as audience is losing patience these days. I hope it appeals to audience who were born before 1990&#x27;s. I am sure Iphone might not relate to it much.	7
Movie of 90s	India	I watched the movie. It was a good movie. The Director has tried his level best to depict the scene of 90s movies. I want to tell all the people who has given such a horrible reviews saying that the movie was awful... that YOU don&#x27;t have the sense of watching movie. The director tried to take us back to enjoy the 90s movie. Istead you started comparing it to the latest movies. Think and than review. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. Just don&#x27;t judge too quickly. Any ways the movie direction was not too good. But we must enjoy movie. Movie is to be entertained rather than to use our brain always when we watch the movie. If we think too much, we will miss many good shots.And if anybody don&#x27;t agree with me .. I don&#x27;t give a F**k.Thank You!	5
Difficult to digest this typical eighties mellow drama	Mumbai, India	Now cinema has grown up very much so audiences are ready to accept new way of presentation of emotions. This is a typical hard core mellow drama film. A person life is in danger. Her mother prays to Goddess Durga, for saving his life and suddenly a Tiger appears and saves him. Makers have followed very closely the old Himmatwla (Jeetendra and Shri Devi starrer). There is no any new approach on this old subject. So, if you love to watch something new. This movie will disappoint you for sure. Even few dialogues from old one has been repeated. Performance wise Ajay Devgan s OK. Paresh Raval and Mahesh Manjrekar are superb. Tamnna fails to impress except in the song &#x22;Naino Me Sapna&#x85;&#x22; Actress who played Ajay Devgan sister is fine. They have also kept the old track of film and certainly they are very good in comparison to the other songs.	5
Blast From The Past!	India	An official remake of the 1983 blockbuster of the same name, which was directed by K. Raghavendra Rao &#x26; starred Jeetendra and Sridevi, &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27;, Directed by Sajid Khan, is old wine in an old bottle. Its A Blast From The Past! &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; takes us back in time, when Hindi Cinema relied on South-Remakes to keep the cash register&#x27;s running. Stars like Jeetendra, Mithun Chakraborty, Sridevi, Anil Kapoor, to name a few, starred in the remakes which were major successes back in the day.Sajid delivers &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; plainly, his film is a cut-copy-paste 80&#x27;s potboiler, that stays true to its genre. However, the film is strictly aimed at the masses. Its primarily for the front-bencher&#x27;s!&#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; tells the story of a Brave Son&#x27;s battle to abolish an evil landlord, who was responsible for his father&#x27;s death. &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; isn&#x27;t meant to be taken seriously &#x26; I not for a single minute took it seriously in any which manner. But, Sajid&#x27;s Screenplay, definitely could&#x27;ve been stronger. Sajid&#x27;s Direction, on the other-hand, is mediocre. Cinematography &#x26; Editing are fair. Action-Sequences will be loved by the masses, its target audience. Music by Sajid-Wajid is foot-tapping. Art Design is first-class.Performance-Wise: Ajay is a competent actor &#x26; he plays the unbeatable hero, with sincerity. He&#x27;s the soul of the film. Tamannaah looks stunning, but gets limited scope. Zarina Wahab is exceptional, yet again. Paresh Rawal &#x26; Mahesh Manjrekar play the villains with ease. Leena Jumani is functional. Adhyayan Suman is alright. Ritesh Deshmukh appears in a small role. Sonakshi Sinha sizzles in the opening song.On the whole, &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; is a film for the masses.	5
Terrible Movie for Dictator Propaganda	Lulea	This shameful movie is about how government of Turkey is run by idealist. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. They not only change real events to their fantasy world conditions, they also used deceased engineers for their own propaganda.This movie is 2015 edition of Triumph of Will by Nazi Germany. I hope everybody will remember terrible people involved with this movie and cast them out from society. P.S. Did you know this movie is screened for free to the audiences by government with tax payers money? Shame on anybody who watches this crap.	1
If you want to make propaganda, at least make a good one	Turkey	A really horrible film which only aims to increase support for the idiotic things the government did and will do. It implies that almost every bad event happened in the past 10-15 years is because of a terrorist organization which works together with CIA, Mossad etc. It is so idiotic that it shows the gezi protests like something that was controlled behind a screen by the same organization (which clearly doesn&#x27;t exist) What can I say, if you are stupid enough to believe these things (unfortunately many people are) you may like the film but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s a poorly written and pathetically directed propaganda and a decent director could do something better while he&#x27;s in the toilet.	1
This so-called movie is a propaganda !	United States	Shame on the directors, the purpose of this so-called movie is clearly politically motivated. The intention smells very bad a political propaganda reminding Goebbels. The movie presents the main non-fictional character Erdogan as a victim of a corruption case. North-Korea propaganda style. Many scenes are from political meeting where Erdogan shows an awful populism. Even the trailer is bad. Anyone can watch Erdogan lies on youtube instead of watching this movie. I would rate zero if that was possible. Keep your eyes away from that. Better to watch &#x22;the interview&#x22; which is at least a good comedy. Regards RK	1
Terrible movie	None	Really awful. Don&#x27;t waste your time. if even they give you money to watch it you will regret and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer. There is no subject on that movie I was lucky I didn&#x27;t pay because it was free I mean cinema was free. Can you imagine they put this movie free so. Ratings will be high. But I said even 10000 lira you will never take your hours back. I prefer to go and watch horse race or ice skating rather then this fully rubbish movie.i could sit and do nothing and still I will be more happy that hours than spend hours watching this thing. I mean who wrote this? Do they have a mind? Really? And how could you accept a role as a actor in such a ridiculous movie? Are you OK? Please tell me? Why did you do that to us? Why ?	1
awful	United Kingdom	This was the awful movie I have ever watched in my life.Please tell me how it&#x27;s possible to formally review a film titled K.O.Z.Do not watch it. It is an absolute waste of time. It was also too boring. Also I paid 10 TL it was a waste of money. Than I heard that one of Turkish Political party giving tickets to its members for free. Highly political movie . It was produced in order to support the views of a political party. Also the the actors and actresses are not acting very well. I have never seen them before. Very small budget movie.This film is sure madness; a mess of epic proportions with so many odd features, amateur features, wooden acting, and loose ends that should technically derail the picture but, for some reason, do not. This is a charismatic film. One that doesn&#x27;t allow itself to exercise more than what it is. It&#x27;s silly, never boring, and embraces badness with a sense of lax, carefree fun.	1
Worst propaganda film ever!	Sweden	This is presumably the worst propaganda film ever shot in the entire history of cinema. It gives a highly biased and re-written account of the recent political corruption scandals in Turkey; the so-called 17-25 December corruption and bribery investigations in the year of 2013. What happened in reality was that, despite obvious evidence, the barefaced government officials including the back-then prime minister (the current president of the republic) insisted to call the investigations as a coup d&#x27;etat, and produced a surrealistic storyline to cover the allegations. The film intends to prove the unbelievable and mind-blowing theses of the government. I admit, though, it would&#x27;ve been fun to watch for those who know the true storyline. Nevertheless, it is painful for me to watch it as I am a Turkish citizen and it reflects the unfortunate fate of my lovely country. The film is now free to see at certain cinemas in Turkey. Even worse is that employees of some pro-government firms are forced to go see the film.Do not ever spend your precious time to see this rubbish film! (unless you&#x27;re researching on contemporary propaganda cinema :)	1
awful movie. dont waste your time.	england	This shameful movie is about government crimes. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. To hide their crimes, They say some people are betrayer. they also used deceased engineers for their own propaganda. People should not watch this movie to support human rights. Did you know this movie is screened for free to the audiences by government with tax payers money? Shame on anybody who watches this movie. If you want to support dictator governments and want to waste your money you may go to this movie. Please offer your friends that they should not watch this movie because of awful scenario. This movie really awful and my advice is to share this comment with your friends.	1
Deserves to be the worst movie in the world	Turkey	If anybody is curious about this movie and wonders why there are so many negative comments about it, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the &#x22;WORST&#x22; movie ever, I mean it. It&#x27;s completely waste of time, don&#x27;t even spend your time to watch it if you still haven&#x27;t. This movie itself is the proof of how much Turkey resembles Nazi Germany nowadays. Since Gezi protests shown the world how &#x22;delusional&#x22; Erdogan is, his only trump card (&#x22;koz&#x22; in Turkish, I mean &#x22;K.O.Z.&#x22;) is now telling lies to people about how aggrieved and &#x22;Muslim&#x22; he is, however, at the same time, doing everything he can to utterly destroy his dissidents, even promoting civil war in order to do so. By the way, this movie would be less terrible if Necati Sasmaz (Polat Alemdar) took part in it. After all, he is able to dodge a bullet by simply crouching down...	1
The lies of a dictator	Istanbul	This movie is on Turkish Televisions everyday. Same fictional stories, same lies... Everyday we see internal mails from the employees of the close to government companies in which the managers threaten the employees to go to this movie and bring back the ticket if they want to keep their job. Turkey is passing through very rough times these days with its fascist government. This movie is trying to cover the billion dollars this government and their families stole (which are proved with many legal tapes, photos and voice recordings but darkened); trying to hide the innocent civilians they killed and trying to hide the evil leading the country. What is fortunate about this film for the Turkish people is that it is so bad. It is horrible and therefore no one will ever watch it in Turkey or abroad. It would have been a good movie with horrible lies but instead it is a bad movie with horrible lies...	1
this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT!	Turkey	WARNING: curse words This is such a shitty movie for several reasons: * This movie is produced only to lie about AKP government&#x27;s false policies, theft and murders. Such as; letting Iranian spies to occupy the intelligence agency of Turkey (MIT), hiding huge bribery (%10 of every business built in Turkey goes to the president of Turkey, RTE), and killing innocent people against their benefit - like the politician Muhsin Yazcolu, and so on.* This movie is produced with the money of AKP government. They gathered the money from the bribery %10 of everything, then pour it into a financial &#x22;pool&#x22;. They support the newspapers, TV channels and a shitty movie like this with this money.* This movie is produced by an ideology, very similar to ISIS. They attack the very foundation of Islam by so-called representing it in this way of pressing, cursing, undermining, and killing - if necessary - all the people oppose to them.* ...the more I continue, the more I have to think of their rotten system. This makes me sick already.To sum up, this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT!	1
do not waste your time and money	konya	This is an ugly movie. It is about government crimes.Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. It is boring. It has nothing to do a nice movie. Do not watch it. It is an absolute waste of time. Actually you do not need to pay Money, because if you go to an Ak p party Office, They will give you a free ticket for this movie.But even in this case, it is an absolute waste of your time. This movie is a total disaster, in terms of story, technical-spectrum&#x27;s.Poor acting. etc. And everyone, probably even the real dictator himself even agrees with this but who cares?.&#x22;hail for fuhrer!&#x22; he and king&#x27;s all men order.	1
IMDb please add no star option	New York	Dear IMDb! please add a no star option cause if I give this film one star this will be an insult for the films which deserve one star. This is the worst and most disinformatic film I ever watched in my life. Please surf on facebook chatting with friends or what instead of watching this film cause it really really full of lyings and I and the people of Turkey is sure that this film is ordered by the current government of Turkey ruled by dictator Erdogan and the government even can put you in prison if you have a poll company and the resutl of you poll is against the gov. There are a lot of journalist are in prison in Turkey that there sine is to write against the gov. And there are hundereds of legal sound and video recording of Erdogan and his ministers that are particpiating in the Turkey&#x27;s big corruption in the history, instead of answering for their corruption they put the polices in jail. and the government bought more than 90% of the media and even republic media are used actively against the people in Turkey and in this situation how can you believe this film that when asked the director about the film that is biased, he answered that I have chosen my side. Long Live Tolerance, dialogue and peace in the world.	1
Turkish taxpayers money gone to waste!	New Orleans, LA	Total waste of time. It is so obvious that the movie was commissioned by Erdogan&#x27;s corrupt putinesque regime. This could be shown in schools as an example of mass media utilization by an authoritarian government a la Hitler or Stalin.Apparently, they can&#x27;t sell virtually any tickets, so it is shown for free in many places.The film portrays Erdogan as the victim of a so-called &#x27;global conspiracy&#x27;, and this whole project seems to be an attempt to maintain his voter base, which his party started to lose after the recent corruption scandals about him and his family.	1
Mein Kampf	Germany	This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It is an analogous to Adolf&#x27;s &#x22;Mein Kampf&#x22;. Turkish Prime Minister lives in a psychotic mood. So does his inner circle. Kleptocracy is a good word that describes the Turkish government today. Crony capitalism takes over market economy, and country&#x27;s economy shrinks everyday. Erdogan tries to disguise the corruption scandals that were unearthed between 17-25 December, 2013. I heard that Turkish government subsidizes this movie, so that people can go to theaters and watch it for free. Overall, this movie depicts the shallow vision of the current corrupt and populist government.	1
Propaganda of a Fallling Fascist Regime	u.s.a	This movie is a just propaganda tool of the Fascist Erdogan&#x27;s regime. Like all fascists and their supporters who have no ability to use cognitive skills and creativity, Producers did a terrible job. Theme is stupid, actors played incredibly terrible. There is nothing related to art of film making. Just a propaganda of totalitarian regime. Fortunately, they are even bad in propaganda compared with previous totalitarian regimes. All public in Turkey employees are being either forced or encouraged to go this movie. Free sessions of this movie are available all over Turkey. One should ask this question when evaluating this movie. if you do not aim profit from this movie, how did producers finance it? The answer is obvious: from poor Turkish people wallets. Fascist Erdogan regime financed this movie. You should see free movie just for understand a Government(Erdogan&#x27;s) could be such a miserable.Erdogan&#x27;s regime are demonizing the biggest social movement in Turkey, the Gulen movement, through this movie because Erdogan wants to control all Turkey. Briefly, this movie is just an unsuccessfull attempt of totalitarian regime for demonizing ideological enemies.	1
Deserves less than 1 star	Istanbul, Turkey	Actually even 1 star out of 10 is too much for this horrible film. The movie is a propaganda of tayyip erdogan, who I think is a dictator. The worst thing about the movie though, is not the bad acting, or for that matter the inane plot or over the top acting, it is the main subject itself. I am wondering why tayyip erdogan didn&#x27;t act himself in the movie. Whoever made this film had a lot of cash, to bag all those actors/actresses to star in it. Now all of them wish they hadn&#x27;t starred in it, I bet they all deny they are in it, it&#x27;s that bad. Conclusion: there was only ever going to be one reason to watch this film and that was to see the Fat Slags, but, as they are not in the movie, there really is no reason to watch this film.	1
Terrible!	Turkey	These kind of films consist of falsified news. They are the films of the state. So they just try to prevent the people from seeing the right things. Also the movie quality is really terrible. The players are really amateur. And nobody has watched it since it was showed in some places. Because everybody says that these movies are falsifying the people. As a result I don&#x27;t recommend watching this film. It doesn&#x27;t worth watching. We need more professional movies. Even if you&#x27;re a talented filmmaker and you&#x27;ve made a movie that everyone is pretty much in love with, you&#x27;re still not guaranteed an easy ride. Because it is not easy to make grate movies in these days.	1
zero	ankara	THE trolls of akp come here and write good rewievs for this bad movie. troll means they gain money to make the akp propaganda on internet. at every where they are make comments and paid for this. believe me the movie is worst movie on earthEven 1 star is a lot for this movie. the producer says that it will break a record. he is right they break the record of the worst movie of world. this movie made by the order of the sultan tayyip erdoan. they try to make the people believe in their lies by this kind of movie and with some shows on TV. but modern people of my country don&#x27;t believe their silly lies. even this movie is free no one watch it. i wish we will break their lies and our country will go to the shinny days. the worst thing a country can live is manage by the peoples which says only lies to their public.you need to give a title to this movie. this title will be the most bad movie of all time.	1
The worst movie one can ever watch.	Istanbul, Turkey	That movie is a perfect reason reason why politicians should stay away from art. I don&#x27;t know if you know what is the story behind this movie, let me explain briefly.In December 2014, it was proved by numerous evidence that Erdogan (the president of Turkey), his family (Bilal The Clever (!) and Sumeyye The Evil) and some important governors from AKP (The ruler party of Turkey) were involved in some serious corruptions. Consequently the positive perceptions of public about Erdogan, his family and Akp were teared down. Since then, pro-Erdogan and pro-Akp media companies started a propaganda to cover these corruptions by creating an imaginary enemy: &#x22;the parallels&#x22;. Kod adi K.O.Z is work of those pro-Erdogan and pro- Akp media companies. With this movie, they aim to manipulate the facts and change the public opinion about those corruptions. They want people to believe that everything was a trap performed by &#x22;the parallels&#x22;.About the movie; regardless of the ideology behind it, casting, plot, music, etc. are at their worst. This is the worst movie that I have ever watched. If you want to make a propaganda to change the realities, you should do something way better than this.	1
Shameless propaganda movie	Ankara	After banning media to share clear corruption evidences, sending many journalist to jail and forcibly closing the cases without trial, Turkish government tries to convince voters using motion picture. Even though the scenario is absurd fantasy, production quality is above average. Seems like producers didn&#x27;t make any budget cut, that deserves one star for the sake of Turkish cinema.Considering that the movie aims people who is not into any form of art, it&#x27;s understandable that some theaters show it free. Due to it&#x27;s low box-office results, it probably will be shown in most of national TV channels just before the national general elections in June 2015. In summary, it&#x27;s a waste of time as a movie, but as a documentary it shows how politics can be shameless in order to keep their authority above public.	1
Extremely high propaganda with no sense of reality	Germany	It&#x27;s the most awful movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. From the beginning till the end just the propaganda of the dictator Erdogan in Turkey. There is no sense in the most of the scenes and the expectations of the viewers are not filled at all. Thus, the movie had a free entrance for a week. It&#x27;s a shame for the country, which mentions to be a democratic one. Very stupid end, very stupid story. Too much problems with the actors. The actors have no sense of authenticity and don&#x27;t play professionally. The story seems to be written by Erdogan himself. It&#x27;s a big problem, that this movie is a &#x22;must seen&#x22; in Turkish schools to manipulate the children. Avoid it.	1
It is not a movie, its AKP AGITATION.	United States	Well lets see here. I can&#x27;t exactly remember how or why I ended up seeing this movie It is so crappy acting, stupid story, no plot, dumb half wits, If I had the choice I would live with herpes in exchange for this movie being totally wiped from my memory. Words cannot describe how completely idiotic and boring KOD Adi K.O.Z is. And oh if you thought the previews had anything to do with the movie think again. They do not. A lot of people in the movie theater walked out never to return. Right now some of city mayors give free ticket to make AKP propaganda but apparently it is not working at all. here I am thinking Well, There is hardly a plot, but old, clich&#xE9; gimmicks to create a Enemy of the State. Does it work? Three? No. It does not. I have no idea how Cem Kurtolu, Hazm K&#xF6;rm&#xFC;k&#xE7;&#xFC;, Tolga Karel, Turgay Tan&#xFC;lk&#xFC;,Remzi Evren got persuaded to participate in the film (MONEY). What can I say? Awful film. That had to be the single worst movie in the history of cinematography. It is not a movie, it&#x27;s AGITATION FOR ELECTION.	1
Nazist Propaganda	Japan	This is a propaganda movie that supported by the president of Turkey and they tried to give their message with a terrible quality.Really awful. Don&#x27;t waste your time. if even they give you money to watch it you will regret and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer. There is no subject on that movie I was lucky I didn&#x27;t pay because it was free I mean cinema was free. Can you imagine they put this movie free so. Ratings will be high. But I said even 10000 lira you will never take your hours back. I prefer to go and watch horse race or ice skating rather then this fully rubbish movie.i could sit and do nothing and still I will be more happy that hours than spend hours watching this thing. I mean who wrote this? Do they have a mind? Really? And how could you accept a role as a actor in such a ridiculous movie? Are you OK? Please tell me? Why did you do that to us? Why ?	1
A bag of stinky lies	Japan	You can fool 45 percent of the population but not me. It is a movie version of the propaganda that we have been seeing for more than 1 year now on television, radio, newspaper, website and even in front of mosques after the Friday Prayer by distribution of fliers. How low will they get is the question and I think that they will try best to be the worst. You can fool 45 percent of the population but not me.

Ridiculous propaganda	Istanbul, Turkey	This is an insult to the art of cinema. Characters are forced with incompetent interpretations. The scenario is written by a point of view that is representative of senseless state repression. To watch this &#x22;non-aesthetic&#x22; film until the end, you have to be mentally retarded or you need to be one of them. The film is a praise to oppression, which nowadays has shown its ugly face in what it claims to be the movie format.. Do not waste your time on this ridiculous propaganda film: The only gain is a total awkwardness. Even Joseph Goebbels had done &#x96;at least- better ones in the Nazi Germany. This will be remembered as a significant disgrace in the cinema culture if remembered at all. This film should be protested on the international platform. What a shame!	1
A Dirty Scenario for Hiding Govts Corruption and Bribes	Turkey	Using Goebbel&#x27;s propaganda tactics, Turkish gov&#x27;t has successfully fooled the crowds in Turkey that it has no connection with corruption. And this &#x27;so-called&#x27; movie is their latest trick.Gentlemen, try to convince us with concrete proofs that 1. your ministers did not receive any bribe (in the form of an expensive wrist watch, for example). 2. the police, which you accused of international ensionage in this dirty movie, did not find thousands os dollars and money counters in the houses of your ministers&#x27; sons.Please don&#x27;t shoot a stupid, unrealistic propaganda movie in an attempt to show your &#x27;innocence&#x27;!	1
The worst movie Ive ever seen	UK	The worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen.. Don&#x27;t waste your time. It is quite obvious that Turkish ruling government commissioned that movie. Shame on you the producers.. You are just the marketing channel of lying government. On the other hand, the cinematography of the movie is awful too. Bad acting, worse directing. Total waste of time. Instead of watching that crap, close your eyes or stare at an empty wall will do more benefit for the soul and mind.I am just wondering, if the actors knew that they were a part of a crap project. Ah, they should be aware right? They must have earned a lot of money to be a part of that propaganda.	1
A communist era type of propaganda	United States	Imagine a totalitarian country leader pays to a media company to have a movie about himself, describing him as an angel/messiah sent to world to bless the human race! I bet you could have read this kind of stories in books describing a Soviet Union or North Korea type of countries. But to your surprise, it comes from a modern country in the middle of Europe: Turkey!The ruling party - AKP and its leader are trying to cover up the corruption they were accused of by any means: Dictatorship kind of laws, imprisonment of journalists, degrading anyone does not support them, and changing the judicial system to protect themselves from any lawsuits. Yes, this is what is happening in Turkey. And yet, financing a movie trying to make the &#x22;leader&#x22;-today&#x27;s president as a savior. Although technically you may call it a movie, but in fact it is a long version of an election advertisement of a corrupt political party.Still, do you want to watch it! You do not have to pay for tickets since this movie is FREE. Just go to the box office and get your tickets for FREE! I would go if they would give free popcorn and soda.	1
Waste of time	United States	This movie is as lots of people mentioned a propaganda movie. I&#x27;ve only watched the trailer but it was clear that it distorts the facts greatly. No one in their right mind would watch this non-sense.. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie.Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie. Crappy propaganda movie.Crappy propaganda.

Negative polar of cinema art	Turkey	As seen &#x22;Bottom 100&#x22;, this movie is the worst propaganda movie of all time. Writing a review for this &#x27;thing&#x27; is a holy mission for future and developing of cinema. Watching this movie is already free. Producers almost offer money to people to be watched. Unfortunately, number of these type propaganda films in Turkey tends to rise. Only a word is enough to explain story: &#x22;parallel&#x22;. This word has a different mean in Turkey. This movie claims that &#x22;parallel state&#x22; always has &#x22;bad role for Turkey&#x22; for significant events in recent years in Turkey even in middle east. Slogan of Turkish government and this movie is one thing: blame parallel state.	1
Propaganda techniques of the movie	Izmir	Propaganda techniques that movie uses: 1. The first, form of propaganda that film uses is assertion. Despite being the most basic technique of propaganda, assertion is surprisingly effective. It consists of simply stating a debatable idea as a fact, with no qualification or explanation. Government is good, opposition is bad.2. Card stacking is a technique in which the propagandist gives an unfair advantage to one point of view, while weakening another. In the movie there is no opposing view, at all.3. Glittering generalities is a colorful term for the appealing, but vague words that often appear in propaganda. Rather than explaining the use of these words, the propagandist leaves them to stand alone as a defense of his or her position. Without context or specific definitions, they serve the sole purpose of evoking certain feelings in the audience. If everything proceeds according to plans, these feelings then translate into unquestioning approval of whatever the propagandist says. Motherland, motherland, and motherland! We wore our martyr clothes when we choose this path!4. An extremely common tool of the propagandist is the false dilemma. This fallacy is known by many names, including &#x22;black-and-white thinking,&#x22; &#x22;false dichotomy,&#x22; and &#x22;false choice.&#x22; Most commonly, it consists of reducing a complex argument to a small number of alternatives and concluding that only one option is appropriate. One product always works, and the other never works. In the movie: One group intends to save the country, and the other is out to ruin it. In reality, however, there are usually many possibilities that go unmentioned.5. Propagandists of the movie often oversimplify complex problems by pointing out a single cause or a single enemy who can be blamed. For everything from Gezi protests to suicides, pinpointing the enemy can help the propagandist achieve his or her agenda.6. People tend to distrust outsiders, and the plain folk technique takes advantage of these misgivings by helping the propagandist to appear more like the average citizen. In the movie, prime minister is extremely humble, easygoing and interacting with regular folks.	1
This Nazi type propaganda film is so bad theaters are actually showing it for free because they are under pressure of the government.	Amsterdam	Propaganda is something all governments or political fractions do. But doing propaganda in such a low quality is actually an achievement. What bothers me is while the government has all the resources and technical possibilities the best they can do is that joke of a film. Even that shows how shitty they are.The film is about a so called parallel state in Turkey, which is blamed for everything that is going bad and all the opposition (no matter how innocent they are) is labeled as a part of that parallel state by the government.Even if you set aside the untrue story film has no cinematographic quality at all.	1

Not only waste of time	istanbul	If you want to suffer and lose your movie appetite, this is the movie! If you want to punish yourself, this movie is one of the best options!Many things to say, but shortly, waste of time. It&#x27;s not waste of money, because it is free ( for ratings&#x27; sake!)Can you imagine that? And what kind of actor could accept a role in such a rubbish movie? Why did you do that to us? How could you do that to yourself? why destroy your image? It is another way to commit a public suicide. I feel sorry about all the people who acted in the movie and who wasted their time. just don&#x27;t be ridiculous, go home and spent some time with your kids, play games, water the plants in the garden, relax and have a sugar free coffee,and make sure that you forgot about the movie!	1
Goebels did it better	Izmir	I don&#x27;t know if this shitty waste of time thing called movie but I&#x27;m sure even conservative people of Turkey didn&#x27;t like this pile of crap. Its obviously a propaganda for Turkish government. The film is nothing but a composition of lies and ignorance. Its the same fascist system in Turkey now like Hitlers time but i think Goebels made it better with The triumph of the will. Although it gave same bad messages like todays Turkish government it was way better in cinematic way. Don&#x27;t watch it you wont get your precious time back. Also the box office results were so bad that the cinemas offered it free. Even in a country like Turkey whose people like anything if its free didn&#x27;t want to see this mixture of pure nonsense and brain agony thing. Your eyes bleed and your brain melts and pours down from your ears if you try to watch this mess. It is so awful that you can barely hold your screams and keep yourself away from burning every copy of this so called movie. If you have any piece of self respect you wouldn&#x27;t go to this amazing loss of time.	1
Worst Movie Ever	None	It&#x27;s just full of lies and bullshits and it&#x27;s a terrible movie. Even a funny cat video is better than this film(!). It&#x27;s just a propaganda for the government. And it&#x27;s scary Turkey Government using techniques of Nazis. And this film has got a terrible scenario, terrible actors, terrible musics.If you think a movie is bad, watch this bullshit and think again. And i think art doesn&#x27;t contain fascism so this movie isn&#x27;t art. It&#x27;s just a fake advertisement. Turkey Government is fascist, killer and thief. We don&#x27;t wanna see propaganda of them. So don&#x27;t watch this bullshit. Do something more important or just try to counting stars. It will be better than watching this movie.	1

Movie on Political Corruption by the Masters of It	Turkey	The movie is indisputably awful. I saw it in a theater when the tickets were made free due to its tremendous box office success until then. In fact, it would lead to a terrible stampede of art-sensitive, god-fearing, highly honorable people of Turkey if they insisted on their price policy because you know, art is for millet&#x27;s (millet being the proudly ignorant portion of Turkish demographics) sake. Seriously, this thing is an insfult to the art. It sucks so hard that it creates a black hole in the history of cinema. And the worst thing is, it was produced by the very folks who came to power in Turkey hand in hand with those whom they blame now.It&#x27;s so incredibly miserable that the unwitting statistical majority of Turkey thinks that the current government is &#x22;somehow&#x22; betrayed by a pseudo-religious community which the government had actually cooperated with from the very beginning. This movie is what you get when their interests eventually conflict. And here is a fun fact: the prime minister once claimed (after 12 years of power, access to any intelligence and government facilities) that he had just learned about the evil plans of this so-called parallel state to overthrow their &#x22;legitimate&#x22; government. Like all any propaganda stuff, this movie is intended to provide credibility to a crazy-ass set of lies that can only make sense in the political discourse. Anyway, that (not whether) the PM did not know about the activity of that so-called parallel structure was seriously debated and then accepted in Turkey and no one suspects anything. It sounds totally legit in Turkey. When a guy who has hours of voice records proving his corruption and lives in a mansion with an estimated number of 1150 rooms blames another guy for using the state for his respective interest, it totally makes sense in Turkey. Just try to imagine the logical processes involved.	1
This movie is for brainwashed Erdogan supporters	United States	Different from other totalitarian regimes, Erdogan&#x27;s party regime is not successful even in propaganda. Turkish people experienced the freedom once, they will never be controlled by an authoritarian regime. This kind of stupid attempts just make Turks laugh. It might affect a limited brainwashed Erdogan supporters but any people who has ability to critically think, even some Erdogan supporters, know why this movie was produced and the story of movie does not make any sense for anybody.Regarding to movie, this is just an failed attempt to make propaganda of corrupt and totalitarian Erdogan regime. Movie was terrible in all aspects. You do not need to pay it. Government financed producers and you can watch free sessions all over the Turkey. Everybody should watch not for it is a good movie, just for understand how Erdogan corrupt regime use this kind of dirty methods for dealing with their ideological opponents.	1
How a dictator can control the social media?	Turkey	Our dictator Tayyip Erdogan is in desperate effort to control media and social media. Surely, he can control the main stream media. The TV&#x27;s are even self censoring themselves now. But the social media is out of control, which drives him crazy. He attempted to totally ban Twitter and Facebook previously. Kod Adi k.o.z. is his propaganda movie, I guess, which was actually designed for people extremely ignorant, or extremely fanatic, or mentally challenged people. So, even for his voters this movie is a disaster. It ended up being the worst movie in IMDb ever, with an average 1.0 (it&#x27;s just because there is no 0.0). His trolls (who drive the voters in social media) were panicked; started to vote 10 star for this movie (as if they were never encountered cinema before). They try to write reviews here; but I realize there is nobody in Erdogan&#x27;s team, who can speak English. Erdogan has been working with Gulen so far (which is what the movie is about). Last year they broke up :) I assume all the educated people in the group were working for Gulen. After they broke up, Erdogan&#x27;s highest qualified agent is no more than a bully.All in all, this whole movie is a step back in civilization and collective mind.	1
worst movie i have ever seen do not watch it	Turkey	This movie is horrendous on so many levels - patronizing to Turkish people, incredibly bad plot and direction, the acting and dialogue is as comfortable as a dentist&#x27;s visit. I suspect the whole thing is purely a desperate attempt by president to pander to uneducated poor supporter&#x27;s (we call them sheep)reactionary tendencies.Either that, or it is just a giant ego trip for him. I had no preconceptions before I went to watch this, and left confused as to the amount of utter garbage wedged into what seemed like an eternity of boredom. Even worse, he is asking his moron supporters to bear false witness by skewing the votes here and on rotten tomatoes. Hypocritical? I&#x27;ll let you decide.	1
Couldnt be worse	istanbul	to clarify the corruption scandal that occurred in 2013 Turkish government decided to produce a propaganda movie. I respect their right to direct a propaganda movie but I can&#x27;t respect this awful quality. When I heard the budget (founded by government) of the movie I thought at least there were some good action scenes but it&#x27;s all about boggy acting and cheap PC effects. Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler used Joseph Goebbels as his propagandist and I have to admit (as technically) even Goebbels did much better movies than this producer.This movie is a shame for the cinema history and it truly deserves to be &#x27;the worst off all time&#x27; PS: The only good thing about this movie was I didn&#x27;t have to pay for it. Our mayor gave us a free-view opportunity.	1
The Worst ever...	turkey	No need to talk about this movie. Indeed, its better not to call it a movie. All you see in the movie is what you see in the trailer. That&#x27;s all. If you regularly watch the news, you can easily predict the conversations before they take place. No new thing. Just a garbage. It would be better to buy a ticket to a cartoon. Another thing is that this movie was filmed by tax payers&#x27; money. The story is all bad and based on the Turkish gov&#x27;s smear campaign on an opposite group to their ideas and policies. The current Turkish gov which is run by a political party called akp sees all opposite thoughts as a coup to their power. They accept no criticism. And this movie is a result of this sick policy.	1
Visuals and Meanings	Turkey	Political propaganda movies has never been such awful. It was a waste of time and money both. An AKP production! Sucks... Lies...By all Visual effects, pictures and script, it is made to give one message it is hatred. Besides all, acting is not sincere. Plots are phony and funny. Settings are terribly contradicting... What is this? Does Producers make this move for idiot viewers? It is not a comedy either. As it is said, &#x22;Honey drips from Honey Pod and Poison drips from Poison Pod. The movie gives very poisonous thoughts and feelings and hatred. It gave me no positive spirit and motion. All movie is about blinding eyes for politicians&#x27; rampant corruption and a political hatred for whom tells the truth. I wish Turkish Cinema could make movies to inspire people for some good deeds and make it universally accepted, understood Like LOVE, UNITY, SINCERITY, TRUTHFULNESS, LOYALTY and FRIENDSHIP. Please do not be a part of this corrupt POLITICS IN TURKEY. there is no use of it.	1
Horribly Bad, an insult to Human intelligence	Turkey	This trash is nothing but a series of advertisements, I don&#x27;t even recommend it only for people with low IQ. Everything about this &#x22;movie&#x22; is horrible. The acting is miserable, there is no plot at all, and it is highly biased on the views of one of the two political rivals by praising one while applying the &#x22;black propaganda&#x22; technique on the other side.

Dont waste your time to watch at this film.	Ankara	Don&#x27;t waste your time to watch at this film. One of the worst movies of all times. Based on politics life in Turkey. Made to be popular and it achieved so, being the worst... Not Only in Turkey but also in Germany the film has chosen the worst by its watchers. Characters in movie are also in shock as they were popular(!) actors and actresses. Rather I recommend you to watch at Selam-Bahara Yolculuk which deserves top rating. Bahara Yolculuk will be in theaters on 13.03.2015. The movie deserves to be the best. Because the movie is based on a true story. And tells the dreams of good intended people who are spread all over the world.	1
Bad, just plain bad, not even close to be a normal movie.	Turkey	Basically, a big propaganda. It was free in the theaters because It is made by peoples taxes. Just think about that for a minute... I mean Hitler made propaganda movies. And they were even better than these movies but do you see it, I&#x27;m criticizing this movie to a dictator&#x27;s movie and why? Because it is made by a freaking dictator! The Tall Man you call him. It&#x27;s horrible, nearly a movie. Acting: Fricking horrible Plot: Fricking bad and they say they are making a movie about &#x22;actual truth behind the lines&#x22;... Ugh Cinematography: What is it? Just please don&#x27;t watch this propaganda.Please just don&#x27;t for the love of god... I mean what the actual freak?! What were they thinking? They toughed we will believe this &#x22;thing&#x22;? We are intelligent enough to understand this is not even close to make us think this is an actual movie... And they say these are all true events but they killed actual living people in it?? They are living in front of our eyes?! What the hell?	1
Political Movie	Ukraine	this movie has been shot over an order. full of lies and fiction. and to smear a group that of world-known successful educationally and financially. also aiming to slander a religious leader who world knows and not to be grabbed by government of Turkey and ruling party. now in Turkey, ruling party wants to be more efficient on every field of life and does not want any opposition. this group (called Cemaat or Hizmet or so called parallel state) has not been surrender to them and kept saying their mistakes and did not bound them. so they try to smear and crash them and after this movement, they will crash other non governmental organizations. there are already some movements against their dreams of sole power and rule the country without any opposition but still half of Turkish are sleeping.This film made by a producer already confessed that he took it by order of government.	1
So it was true; THEY ARE ALL BIDON KAFALI	None	This &#x22;movie&#x22; is a disgrace to all actors and movie makers on this planet. My 7 year old nephew would come up with a better plot, and my other 5 year old nephew would do better acting than these bozos.They wanted to do propaganda and they had tons of options; a news story, a documentary, a biography... But they decided to make a &#x22;movie&#x22;.Do I decide to make a movie when I am mad at something? NOWhy?Because like any person with some common sense and some logic(and some brain cells), I am aware I am not good at producing movies, this is not what I do, not even as a hobby.But do they have any common sense or logic(or any brain cell)? Of course; NOT.So they decided to make a movie, even tho they had no idea how to make one.So this &#x22;movie&#x22; proves the legend; THEY ARE ALL &#x22;BIDON KAFALI&#x22;...	1
Goebbels did it better	Turkey	Governments always use the instrument of propaganda to fortify they position and claim to be the only solution for its people. The Turkish governments attempted to make a film with the same reason and tried to redirect their mistakes to some secret &#x22;behind the curtain&#x22; powers. This film should be regarded as the worst attempt to make propaganda. Goebbels was more successful almost 70 years ago. (In propaganda, not ideology!) The intellectual level of the makers is beyond detectable level. The scenario awful and the way to tie diverse facts even worse than any propagandist film I was ever exposed to. This is real art, art of intellectual torture.	1
Crappy political propaganda at most!	Turkey	I&#x27;m not even going to write about the characters, plot, issues, etc. It&#x27;s nothing more than a cheap political propaganda film molded into a nonsense crime/spy/suspense plot. It&#x27;s utterly worthless, shameful trash endorsed by the AKP (today&#x27;s ruling political party in Turkey) in anticipation of the upcoming elections. Reminds me of Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels&#x27; elaborate system of NAZI propaganda. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the full-starred ratings as those reviews belong to full time &#x27;paid trolls&#x27; working for their master!Deserves ZERO stars!!	1
very nice movie	None	it tells truth about Turkey. most events in movie are true. also cast is very successful. don&#x27;t mind about movie&#x27;s rating. it&#x27;s low because of Gulen&#x27;s crew. they&#x27;re trying to hide their aims and truth. if you&#x27;re really interested in Turkey&#x27;s real problem, you should watch it immediately. movie shows the real terrorists and traitors. people, who seems Muslims but they&#x27;re not, planning to help our enemies. they want money for theirs aims but they tells that, they&#x27;re spending money for Muslims, according to them, their leader is the prophet and he has no wrong. they change Islam for their profit. in this movie, you will learn their real aims and all of wrongs. director must be very brave because, when this terrorists are powerful, they&#x27;ve arrested some people because of their books and writings.	10
Good movie, but effects could be better	Netherlands	The people which are afraid to see the reality are only giving a negative review/score for this movie. I&#x27;m sure they never watched this movie either. Anyway this is my point of view: The effects were not so good to be honest, but the main purpose is to give a message to the Turkish people what kind of danger the deep state poses on the Turkish republic. The main character that played the prime minister were one of the best actors i&#x27;ve ever seen before. In short : People should only look to the messages. A little bit of propaganda is always present in this kind of movies, but that doesn&#x27;t means it deserves a bad review. The Gulen movement&#x27;s goal is to fill their own pockets everybody knows this. This is well explained by the movie makers.	10
Haters gonna hate mate	Turkey	The only movie could explain what&#x27;s really going on in Turkey last 4 to 7 years. They have showed every single detail which was made this sneaky religious order. Those haters just believe anything they see from media. They even don&#x27;t want their country to rise up. Because they can not put up with that real public is in order not those stupid money people. Open your eyes, we are 16th most developed economy in the world and counting up. What is matter with you? NOBODY WANTS TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU LIVE, GOVERNMENT IS JUST GIVING OTHERS THE RIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE OTHER FOR YEARS. Believe or not, Turkey is on the right way. No one can stop us from our way.	10
Code: Doubling social media	Turkey	The thriller movie tells the story of a religious sect. Leader of the sect advises his followers to double the social media yet he dreamed prophet and prophet advised him to do so! In real life! Really! He claims that! This heresy explains a lot about why so many troll has given 1 point to this movie even though they did not see it! Regarding movie, it is not a state of art. But a breathtaking engrossing storytelling with a lot of mafian style swagger lines which is a very popular cinematic method in Turkey. If you take a glance at rating analysis you will see clearly too many 1 point raters without seeing movie and 10 point raters that i doubt all of them see the movie! What to conclude neither an one point movie nor 10 point movie. Do not trust this polarized trolls at all :)	7
A must watch for everyone who wants to see the truths.	Turkey	This movie is based on a fictional story but actually it reflects the Turkey&#x27;s recent past in a very exciting storyline.To make the film clear in the readers&#x27;s mind i firstly would like to say that as you may see Turkey is becoming a powerful country in every aspect because of its very fast growing economy, increasing life standards, excellent foreign politics, Mr. President&#x27;s laudable strategies. However; especially in the last 2 years many incidents occurred which were obviously targeting the government of Turkey and when you watch this film you will witness all the conspiracies and the enemies of Turkish nation.------------Spoiler------------The story line is such a good one that you will get excited every second of the movie. If you are following the politics you will obviously enjoy the movie even more because the fictional persons (especially Mehdi Efendi and its followers) are reflecting some real identities and the incidents are actually real. And the attempt to arrest the undersecretary of T.I.T was such a good one. -------------Spoiler---------------The movie&#x27;s score was 1/10 while i was writing this review but believe or not the scores are just another conspiracy:) Park protesters (or chapullers;) which you can see in the movie as well are just organized themselves in HERE as well in order to give 1/10 for the movie. Because they just cant stand to see something supporting the government. But the truth is, all of these conspiracies were made in real and they are still working as a threat to the Turkish Nation. But they will never succeed, for sure.So do not look at the score and watch this movie. P.S.: We are waiting for the next movie as there are more conspiracies made and we would like to see them all in theatres as well. (17 December incident, especially)	10
Reality Show	pennsylvania	This movie is recorded by an order of Government of Turkey, The story is true but the way of showing is not impressive, it seems like one day job, script is glorified, it is about parallelism, which means hidden government in the government controlled by so called HOCA EFEND - Fetullah G&#xFC;len. Which in fact is crime boss, this movie hurts the followers of HOCA EFEND and his Allies (Gezi Park Players and who ever is enemy of government).Story is good, rent it and watch it, you will be surprised not disappointed. don&#x27;t judge the movie by reviews they don&#x27;t reflect the reality.	5
CIAmaat Reviews and votes	United States	I watched the movie. In movie most of subjects are true and I lived it in my life. I think most of the votes and reviews owners&#x27; didn&#x27;t watch the movie. They only wanted to denigrate the movie. It can&#x27;t be the worst movie in the world :). It&#x27;s very easy to vote something online. For example CIAmaat members know it. For example if something is good for their benefit, they all votes it quickly. We see it when the after- school supports closing. They all entered tweets at certain time. So we don&#x27;t pay no attention their votes and reviews. There was no slanders in movie. There was no lies in the movie. Maybe filming techniques are not best but this movie tries to tell about the Turkiye&#x27;s truths.	10
