So it was true; THEY ARE ALL BIDON KAFALI	None	This &#x22;movie&#x22; is a disgrace to all actors and movie makers on this planet. My 7 year old nephew would come up with a better plot, and my other 5 year old nephew would do better acting than these bozos.They wanted to do propaganda and they had tons of options; a news story, a documentary, a biography... But they decided to make a &#x22;movie&#x22;.Do I decide to make a movie when I am mad at something? NOWhy?Because like any person with some common sense and some logic(and some brain cells), I am aware I am not good at producing movies, this is not what I do, not even as a hobby.But do they have any common sense or logic(or any brain cell)? Of course; NOT.So they decided to make a movie, even tho they had no idea how to make one.So this &#x22;movie&#x22; proves the legend; THEY ARE ALL &#x22;BIDON KAFALI&#x22;...	1
Goebbels did it better	Turkey	Governments always use the instrument of propaganda to fortify they position and claim to be the only solution for its people. The Turkish governments attempted to make a film with the same reason and tried to redirect their mistakes to some secret &#x22;behind the curtain&#x22; powers. This film should be regarded as the worst attempt to make propaganda. Goebbels was more successful almost 70 years ago. (In propaganda, not ideology!) The intellectual level of the makers is beyond detectable level. The scenario awful and the way to tie diverse facts even worse than any propagandist film I was ever exposed to. This is real art, art of intellectual torture.	1
Crappy political propaganda at most!	Turkey	I&#x27;m not even going to write about the characters, plot, issues, etc. It&#x27;s nothing more than a cheap political propaganda film molded into a nonsense crime/spy/suspense plot. It&#x27;s utterly worthless, shameful trash endorsed by the AKP (today&#x27;s ruling political party in Turkey) in anticipation of the upcoming elections. Reminds me of Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels&#x27; elaborate system of NAZI propaganda. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the full-starred ratings as those reviews belong to full time &#x27;paid trolls&#x27; working for their master!Deserves ZERO stars!!	1
very nice movie	None	it tells truth about Turkey. most events in movie are true. also cast is very successful. don&#x27;t mind about movie&#x27;s rating. it&#x27;s low because of Gulen&#x27;s crew. they&#x27;re trying to hide their aims and truth. if you&#x27;re really interested in Turkey&#x27;s real problem, you should watch it immediately. movie shows the real terrorists and traitors. people, who seems Muslims but they&#x27;re not, planning to help our enemies. they want money for theirs aims but they tells that, they&#x27;re spending money for Muslims, according to them, their leader is the prophet and he has no wrong. they change Islam for their profit. in this movie, you will learn their real aims and all of wrongs. director must be very brave because, when this terrorists are powerful, they&#x27;ve arrested some people because of their books and writings.	10
Good movie, but effects could be better	Netherlands	The people which are afraid to see the reality are only giving a negative review/score for this movie. I&#x27;m sure they never watched this movie either. Anyway this is my point of view: The effects were not so good to be honest, but the main purpose is to give a message to the Turkish people what kind of danger the deep state poses on the Turkish republic. The main character that played the prime minister were one of the best actors i&#x27;ve ever seen before. In short : People should only look to the messages. A little bit of propaganda is always present in this kind of movies, but that doesn&#x27;t means it deserves a bad review. The Gulen movement&#x27;s goal is to fill their own pockets everybody knows this. This is well explained by the movie makers.	10
Haters gonna hate mate	Turkey	The only movie could explain what&#x27;s really going on in Turkey last 4 to 7 years. They have showed every single detail which was made this sneaky religious order. Those haters just believe anything they see from media. They even don&#x27;t want their country to rise up. Because they can not put up with that real public is in order not those stupid money people. Open your eyes, we are 16th most developed economy in the world and counting up. What is matter with you? NOBODY WANTS TO CHANGE THE WAY YOU LIVE, GOVERNMENT IS JUST GIVING OTHERS THE RIGHTS THAT HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE OTHER FOR YEARS. Believe or not, Turkey is on the right way. No one can stop us from our way.	10
Code: Doubling social media	Turkey	The thriller movie tells the story of a religious sect. Leader of the sect advises his followers to double the social media yet he dreamed prophet and prophet advised him to do so! In real life! Really! He claims that! This heresy explains a lot about why so many troll has given 1 point to this movie even though they did not see it! Regarding movie, it is not a state of art. But a breathtaking engrossing storytelling with a lot of mafian style swagger lines which is a very popular cinematic method in Turkey. If you take a glance at rating analysis you will see clearly too many 1 point raters without seeing movie and 10 point raters that i doubt all of them see the movie! What to conclude neither an one point movie nor 10 point movie. Do not trust this polarized trolls at all :)	7
A must watch for everyone who wants to see the truths.	Turkey	This movie is based on a fictional story but actually it reflects the Turkey&#x27;s recent past in a very exciting storyline.To make the film clear in the readers&#x27;s mind i firstly would like to say that as you may see Turkey is becoming a powerful country in every aspect because of its very fast growing economy, increasing life standards, excellent foreign politics, Mr. President&#x27;s laudable strategies. However; especially in the last 2 years many incidents occurred which were obviously targeting the government of Turkey and when you watch this film you will witness all the conspiracies and the enemies of Turkish nation.------------Spoiler------------The story line is such a good one that you will get excited every second of the movie. If you are following the politics you will obviously enjoy the movie even more because the fictional persons (especially Mehdi Efendi and its followers) are reflecting some real identities and the incidents are actually real. And the attempt to arrest the undersecretary of T.I.T was such a good one. -------------Spoiler---------------The movie&#x27;s score was 1/10 while i was writing this review but believe or not the scores are just another conspiracy:) Park protesters (or chapullers;) which you can see in the movie as well are just organized themselves in HERE as well in order to give 1/10 for the movie. Because they just cant stand to see something supporting the government. But the truth is, all of these conspiracies were made in real and they are still working as a threat to the Turkish Nation. But they will never succeed, for sure.So do not look at the score and watch this movie. P.S.: We are waiting for the next movie as there are more conspiracies made and we would like to see them all in theatres as well. (17 December incident, especially)	10
Reality Show	pennsylvania	This movie is recorded by an order of Government of Turkey, The story is true but the way of showing is not impressive, it seems like one day job, script is glorified, it is about parallelism, which means hidden government in the government controlled by so called HOCA EFEND - Fetullah G&#xFC;len. Which in fact is crime boss, this movie hurts the followers of HOCA EFEND and his Allies (Gezi Park Players and who ever is enemy of government).Story is good, rent it and watch it, you will be surprised not disappointed. don&#x27;t judge the movie by reviews they don&#x27;t reflect the reality.	5
CIAmaat Reviews and votes	United States	I watched the movie. In movie most of subjects are true and I lived it in my life. I think most of the votes and reviews owners&#x27; didn&#x27;t watch the movie. They only wanted to denigrate the movie. It can&#x27;t be the worst movie in the world :). It&#x27;s very easy to vote something online. For example CIAmaat members know it. For example if something is good for their benefit, they all votes it quickly. We see it when the after- school supports closing. They all entered tweets at certain time. So we don&#x27;t pay no attention their votes and reviews. There was no slanders in movie. There was no lies in the movie. Maybe filming techniques are not best but this movie tries to tell about the Turkiye&#x27;s truths.	10
