The worst film made by anyone, ever, at anytime	United States	There are no words that come to mind after seeing this film. Travesty, horrific, absurd, ridiculous, and mind-numbingly stupid all come to mind but none of &#x27;em quite describe just how awful this &#x22;film&#x22; really is. To see where everyone went wrong, let&#x27;s break it down!1. It takes 45 minutes until the actual plot begins to develop. By this time, the majority of viewers have fallen asleep or have taken their own lives.2. The actor who plays Rod, Alan Bagh. He makes me miss Nicholas Cage. NO NOT THE BEES!!! AHHHH!!!3. The birds. What do they do exactly? Nothing. The birds come down and fly directly in front of the victims face. Then they die for reasons only criminally insane director James Nguyen knows. God help us.4. Read my parental advisory5. &#x22;Hey I thought I told you to stand back. These birds are contaminated&#x22;6. What is wrong with Rod&#x27;s friend? And why can&#x27;t he get a good looking girlfriend?7. The dialogue. It&#x27;s like watching a poorly translated foreign film. &#x22;I like you and because you are pretty to me&#x22; &#x22;I thank you this words they make me happy&#x22; &#x22;Yaaaaaayyy...&#x22;8. This quote: &#x22;Why would birds do something like that? Why would they just attack&#x22; &#x22;......I don&#x27;t know&#x22;-------The good?1. Thank god for Whitney Moore in lingerie. The only believable thing about this movie was that she got a job at Victoria&#x27;s Secret.And that&#x27;s my review. Go see it. I guarantee you will never see a worse film.	1
A must-see movie.  Really. Im not kidding.	Raleigh, NC, USA	Don&#x27;t be fooled by the rating. You have to watch &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; at some point.This movies outshines &#x22;Troll 2&#x22; in every respect. It puts &#x22;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#x22; and &#x22;The Room&#x22; to shame. Imagine a movie that would be created solely to give film students a paper topic on how NOT to make movies. Every conceivable error has been made in making &#x22;Birdemic.&#x22; At first, you simply won&#x27;t be able to believe that the film is not a spoof. But if you read about the film and about Nguyen, and if you take a few moments to watch the additional material on the DVD, you will soon agree that this was just a misguided effort on the entire production team&#x27;s part.The sound is the most outstanding example of sheer incompetence. The director clearly understood what Foley is, since the gunshots have all been added post-production, but I guess they just didn&#x27;t have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.The acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn&#x27;t even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of camel-toe in at least one scene, but she&#x27;s the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is &#x22;give your financial backers a small part&#x22; bad.If you want to explain blocking, editing, framing, sound markers, continuity, reverse shots, and other film terms to your friends, this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.While the CGI (and I use the term in only the broadest sense) birds are hilarious, my favorite scene is the &#x22;retirement&#x22; scene. I think that the word &#x22;retirement&#x22; is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It&#x27;s hard to miss.BUT...it&#x27;s strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies, it&#x27;s not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can&#x27;t tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes (and there really aren&#x27;t that many) have some aspect (poor sound, hilariously unrealistic dialogue, odd things going on in the background) that fascinate. You&#x27;ll be giggling and poking your elbow into the side of the person beside you.So, go rent it. Really. You won&#x27;t regret it.	1
Unbearable	United States	Where does one start? How can you mentally digest something like Birdemic? I am still in shock. I have seen some shitty movies in my time. But Birdemic, friends and neighbors, is the worst movie in the history of film-making, on this planet or in any other dimension for that matter. It is bad, OMG, right off the scale on the shitometer. The acting? Poor Alan Bagh, is he a living, walking wooden plank? Special effects? I swear, the birds are cardboard cutouts dangling from strings. For some reason, they explode when they hit something. Why? Why is that? Can&#x27;t somebody explain, for freak&#x27;s sake?Everything stinks so very gaggingly. A rhesus monkey with a camcorder poking out of its arse would do better. Beware, my friends, beware of this abomination that is Birdemic.	1
a film for our times, for ALL times, or perhaps none at all....	United States	Sometimes there is a film that comes along that boggles the mind. You cannot believe the thing exists, but there it is, paddling its arms forward like a Special Olympics finalist (and no, this is not a joke on the Special Olympics - they&#x27;re too good for Birdemic: Shock and Terror). The movie tricks a viewer like yours truly; at first, having not seen anything made by its director, the inimitable James Nguyen - he has two other films to his credit, Replica and Julie and Jack, neither seen by me (just as well, one of whom gives its highest praise as &#x22;Ed Wood quality&#x22; on IMDb) - I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was really seeing, if it was either the highest or lowest of artistic expression.The film takes place in some sunny seaside community on the California coast - as we&#x27;re made PAINFULLY CLEAR in the opening from-the-car driving shots (immediately calling to mind the opening credits of Manos: The Hands of Fate) - and is about how Rod (Alan Bough) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who meet one day by chance, he a successful solar-panel salesman and she a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model (she just made the cover!) Oh, and there&#x27;s an almost inexplicable warning of a crazy-killer bird epidemic on the news, from, um, I guess it&#x27;s global warming. And after about a half hour of almost *nothing* going on between these two pieces of cardboard-as-actors, the birds finally arrive.... oh yes, how they arrive.What I mean by my uncertainty of what I was seeing, it felt like a double-edged sword. I kept thinking during the film, &#x27;either Nguyen is a total genius, crafting the most intentionally bad movie in recent memory, or he&#x27;s quite possible the most sickening hack you&#x27;ve never wanted to meet.&#x27; It&#x27;s one thing that the film was shot on a shitty camcorder. It&#x27;s another that the actors appear to be non-professionals or at best from community theater (Alan Bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed; Moore is too hot to have that happen, though her talent is just as nill).But it&#x27;s something else how absolutely, and surprisingly consistently, awful the film-making is. Even if you&#x27;ve never taken a class in proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing, Birdemic shines so mightily in its crap-ness. Scenes start and end without a proper marker, as if the editor didn&#x27;t know how to flow from one scene- one SHOT- to the next. Sound is completely mis-matched from one shot to the next. The music is the kind of synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive Bin-Laden out of his cave (they even go as far as to rip-off the John Lennon song &#x22;Imagine&#x22; for a girl character wearing a &#x22;Imagine Peace&#x22; shirt. And the birds... oh, boy, the birds (if you need further proof, watch the trailer, do yourself a favor and get it out of the way).Now, again, experiencing this film, especially in the case I had in a theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based on the trailer or the website or the claim by Nguyen to be a &#x22;Master of the Romantic Thriller&#x22; (Trademarked. I&#x27;m not kidding), that this is perhaps just a brilliant prank, a satire of epic proportions. Certainly the &#x22;message&#x22; part of the movie- and it&#x27;s wielded with such a sledgehammer it would make Stanley Kramer look like Jim Jarmusch - is done to such a ludicrous extent, with characters appearing for walk-on scenes like a Old-man Biologist who appears to explain that the birds were caused by man&#x27;s harm to the planet, or the &#x22;Tree-Man&#x22; in the woods who has a tree-house home and finds the birds don&#x27;t attack him because he&#x27;s in the woods and not out on the road like the rest of stupid man-animal civilization. Not to mention the rather *listen to us now* attitude of the main characters driving their hybrid cars and seeing An Inconvenient Truth (I s**t you not, this is in the movie) and their silly solar panels. Who ever heard of that working really well? All of this could, potentially, really be just a put-on of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen&#x27;s hand for pulling off such a feat. But, no, Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production, only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing &#x22;Springtime for Hitler&#x22; for the first time (if you need proof, look at this NY Times article quote: &#x22;I never went to film school,&#x22; Mr. Nguyen said. &#x22;But I did go to what you&#x27;d call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.&#x22;). I&#x27;ll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there, even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn&#x27;t get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.Oh, don&#x27;t get me wrong, Birdemic is absolutely, hysterically, historically, gloriously funny. It&#x27;s a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI (the birds just float, like a screensaver), and non-existent acting, and plot that... wait, what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either, or shots that match up? It&#x27;s so funny that I ended up feeling just a wee-bit guilty by the end. It&#x27;s easy to mock this movie, like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn&#x27;t an intentional anti-film, then it&#x27;s just a really bad Manos/Ed-Wood level movie, and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It&#x27;s not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room, After Last Season, and Severed Ways, it&#x27;s one of the real no-budget bad-movie finds of the past ten years. A must-see, for every wrong reason imaginable.	2
The worst movie of the decade and probably the most preachy	Las Vegas	I just got done watching Birdemic for the first time, I knew it was made on 10,000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. This same day I also watched The Happening and The Crawling Eye (MST3K version) so maybe I was feeling masochistic. This movie was all around bad in every aspect. It looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and it&#x27;s obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. I know that because the sound is very awful, the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right, and there&#x27;s way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. The worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices.The movie itself is very slow paced, the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. The problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters, not even vanilla more like tofu bland. We get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels, hybrid cars, global warming, and even the war in Iraq as much as he can. The script is almost a love letter to Al Gore. This feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about, his obsession with a greener world, and his dates.The second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. Lots of 2D computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. Somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. The couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van, this van has everything from handguns and two AK-47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo (I&#x27;m guessing the van has Game Genie,) as well as medical supplies, and anything the plot requires. Most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. The survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isn&#x27;t the eagles we should be afraid of, it&#x27;s global warming and mankind&#x27;s use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster.As far as the action goes, it&#x27;s about as lame as the trailer makes it look. When someone dies it&#x27;s just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. There&#x27;s also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them (even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the movie)who wants their gas, which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. There&#x27;s a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. At least companies like Troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity, over the top gore, and comedy. The people behind Birdemic have the worst CGI effects since the old Star Trek movies and long speeches about the environment. If you watch it, bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. Other than that it&#x27;s Duck Hunt: The Movie.	1
A joke, the worst film ever committed to celluloid	Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England	First of all, to approach &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22; with any kind of hope of witnessing a good feature film is utter lunacy. &#x22;Amateur&#x22; is a word a thousand times too generous for this film&#x27;s description. Even given its low budget of $10,000, the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel, the film is a joke. The acting is unspeakably bad, the &#x22;special&#x22; effects aren&#x27;t worth mentioning, the music is corny and inappropriate, and the film&#x27;s editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip-book.The only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that, a joke. The above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to. However, even this joke wears thin pretty quickly, and you&#x27;re left feeling quite empty, as if you&#x27;ve been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life.Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that it is the director James Nguyen who is having the last laugh, as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it. Perhaps the joke is on us, and the director&#x27;s intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy. Even so, absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is. It makes Battlefield Earth feel like Star Wars, and makes the special effects of 1933&#x27;s King Kong look like those of Avatar. It is, quite simply, the worst film ever committed to celluloid.Watching the trailer, I actually had a decent laugh, and thought it might be worth it. But having watched the finished product, the knowledge that somebody spent $10,000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating, and actually quite offensive. People were PAID to produce this. With MONEY. I still don&#x27;t believe it.	1
Birdemic - Making The Room look like an Academy Award winning film	United States	If you have any chance of seeing this movie, do everything in your power to do it. This is one of the best &#x22;so bad it&#x27;s funny&#x22; movies I have ever seen. I saw an encore presentation in L.A. and haven&#x27;t seen a room of people laughing so hard in my life. It simply has everything one could want. Bad CGI (the animated birds in the movie are actually GIFs!), horrific acting, drunken cinematography, you name it, this movie had it. I typically zone out when watching a funny bad movie, the plot will lull and some things will get boring. But NOT Birdemic! This movie seems to be specifically tailored to ensure you don&#x27;t get bored! Out of all the things this movie got wrong, keeping your eyes glued to the screen, they got right. Encore James! Encore! Put it this way, this movie is even worse than my sentence structure in this review. Do yourself a favor and SEE THIS MOVIE!	10
What a joke	Baltimore, Maryland USA	If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I was watching this dumpsterpiece movie with four friends, I would be bashing my head against something hard, and questioning the very usefulness of my life. In other words, yes, this movie was THAT bad. I&#x27;ve heard that Birdemic was supposed to be a very bad, very cheap rip off of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds, but Lord almighty! Fifteen minutes into it I was starting to panic.Rod (Alan Bagh), is a Silicon Valley software designer yuppie who has just made it big. Not to mention he always walks like he wears a back brace. He&#x27;s about to land a deal that will make him a millionaire, because this movie certainly won&#x27;t do that. Also, he drives my dream car (a Ford Mustang), and always drives about 20 mph below the speed limit. Have some respect, dude. But anyway, Rod goes into a diner and meets Natalie (Whitney Moore) by first asking &#x22;didn&#x27;t you go to high school with me?&#x22; Natalie is also a very hot blonde aspiring model, who just happens to give her phone number to a guy like Rod, whom she barely knows. That&#x27;s basically the first half of the movie, a romance blossoming. On top of that, there are stories about the ice caps melting, and swarms of eagles dying. Uh oh, does this mean Al Gore was right? One night, Rod and Natalie go to a cheap motel to have loving, but emotionless sex. All of a sudden, swarms of eagles are going around, swarming people, killing people, and blowing up houses by ramming into them like kamikaze pilots. Now, it&#x27;s up to this young couple to try to find survivors, and kill birds. Soon along the way, we meet Dr. Jones (Rick Camp), who tells us that we screwed up this planet, created global warming, and now birds are killing everybody.So .where to begin with this movie? First off, it has probably the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie that&#x27;s not a porno. I would say the acting was as wooden as Pinocchio, but Pinocchio actually DOES become a real boy at the end. There was no hope for this movie at all. I saw this being sold on blu ray for $25. I don&#x27;t even think this movie cost 25 cents to make! Just watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean. Everything about this movie sucked. The script was so badly written, it was almost a tragicomedy. At least Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds had robotic birds. Okay, the CGI buzzards that were attacking people, I think the editing machines in a public access TV studio are more sophisticated. Plus, there were a lot of underlying themes about global warming here. If these environmentalist screenwriters wanted to convince me to stop contributing to greenhouse gasses, they&#x27;re going to have to do better that Birdemic. I seriously hope the filmmakers weren&#x27;t taking this too seriously, because it&#x27;s such a joke.I love B rate movies, and I like playing &#x22;Mystery Science Theater 3000&#x2033; with them. But this movie made Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. Some of these lines are so awful: &#x22;Humans need to stop playing cowboys with nature.&#x22; When people were attacked by birds, they were more or less being attack by a Windows 3.1 screensaver. I would have made a better movie when I was in middle school. What else do I have to say? Just go online and watch the trailer, that will visualize everything. I&#x27;m all for cheap filmmaking, but this is just pushing it.I leave you with this thought. I mentioned earlier that I was watching this colostomy bag of a movie with four friends, where we made sarcastic remarks. My thought is maybe this is why bad movies are made, why Birdemic was made&#x96;to bring in more social gatherings.	1
really awful, but strangely entertaining	United States	Given that &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; has been blasted by many critics, I think I should say something positive about it to start off with. The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable, for one thing, and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma; also, anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.Less positive aspects of this film are legion, so much so that I&#x27;m reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 (in which case &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned, and perhaps a 4 for meaning well (though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham-handed manner)). Still, something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all ~ in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft ~ a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal (thus making the upcoming larger-budget sequel all the more intriguing).Yet, I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound, editing, writing, acting, direction and special effects, it might just be a forgettable homage to &#x22;The Birds its very flaws elevate (or should I say depress?) it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like &#x22;The Room&#x22; and &#x22;Manos: the Hands of Fate&#x22; ~ the legendary realm of films that are so bad they&#x27;re good. So, giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft, I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 (once it gathers the requisite number of votes).	1
Who needs a summary? Its Birdemic!	United States	This movie puts Puts Troll 2 to shame and rivals The Room... but I really think this one&#x27;s the best of the worst... ever.To truly enjoy this heap of hilarity, get yourself 5 or 6 friends with a 12 pack each of PBR and have a MOVIE NIGHT DRINKING GAME!Rules:1. Any time the camera pans, drink. 2. Any time the audio gets botched, drink. 3. Any time Rod walks unconvincingly (that&#x27;s right... you&#x27;ll know it when you see it), drink. 4. Any time birds explode, drink.Of course add your own rules, but sip small or you&#x27;ll be through all twelve of those cold ones in no time. Dear God this movie is fantastic.	10
If you put The Room, Troll 2 and The Birds in a bender	AR, United States	This is like &#x22;The Room&#x22; with mutant bird .gif&#x27;s. I understand its low budget, but wow. My guess is it was recored on an Insignia brand handy cam (the audio is poorly recorded. sometimes you can hear what their saying, sometimes not. but it doesn&#x27;t matter, you wont care). The acting is wooden and stagy at best, but I have to say it was great for a laugh. One of those surreal moments like when I first watched Troll 2 or The Room where you ask yourself &#x22;Is this really happening?&#x22;. The absurdity of the whole thing is priceless. Bring your buddies and have a laugh. Also, reading the comment titled &#x22;What is the Birdemic? Well, one of the best films ever, for one thing&#x22; they have to be in the cast or crew, which is really pathetic. They comment on how much you care about the characters...you don&#x27;t! The girl would have pepper sprayed him and screamed &#x22;stalker!&#x22; within moments of meeting him. She&#x27;s a model who&#x27;s agency is in a strip mall next to a tobacco store. He makes a &#x22;big deal&#x22; by giving a customer half off, making a million dollars...last time I checked, two times a million is two million dollars...he lost his company two million dollars and he&#x27;s &#x22;WOOOO&#x22;ing? And this is all within the first 5 minutes of the movie. This is a monstrosity on film, but a fun monstrosity.	1
What the hell just happened to me?	United States	Potentially the worst movie ever. Troll 2? Pure genius compared to Birdemic. Manos? Well... maybe on par.I checked the Spoiler Warning box, but I seriously have no clue how this thing ended... A beach or something. It&#x27;s all very fuzzy to me. I literally went into this realizing it was going to be bad. Expecting it, and waiting for it. I had a discussion with a coworker, and we were reliving all of the fun BAD movies we&#x27;d watched as kids... Food of the Gods? Beyond Atlantis? Troll 2? All of them laughably bad, and just kinda fun to watch when you realized their stink going into it... This movie literally takes 45 minutes to get to any humor. Seemingly, the first 10 minutes are nothing but driving shots in Northern California. Then we&#x27;re treated to the two main characters getting to know one another, being successful in business, etc. It&#x27;s literally 45 minutes of useless back story.Once the birds get involved, there&#x27;s much to enjoy (nothing to move the rating from a one...). You know? I&#x27;m just going to fore go the review, and list my favorite parts (in no particular order):1) During their date, the stop for a moment to admire the birds landing in the trees... the birds look like they are moving in slow motion, and are our first glimpse into how bad the CGI is going to be... Bubo the Owl from Clash of the Titans looked infinitely more real...2) They meet up with random survivors in the hotel, and oddly enough these folks are armed with an M16, and a spare handgun. 3) They are driving down the road (in a supposedly war torn NoCal) supposedly &#x22;fighting off&#x22; the birds (none of which are in the picture), and they have the M16 and Pistol shooting out the window. There are PLENTY of other cars driving down the road... you have to wonder what these folks thought was going on!4) The birds are capable of explosion inducing dive bombs! They make the sound of a dive bomber from WWII movie, too... No, Really!5) MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE... People are stuck in a bus, and are being terrorized by the birds... our heroes pull in to save the day. They are facing the bus, and the birds are between the bus, and our heroes. What do the heroes do? Pull out their M16, and just start SPRAYING with NO REGARD. In the real world, both bird, and passenger would be dead... In Birdemic? Not so much. 6) The Tree Hugger... he hears a &#x22;mountain Lion&#x22; so he has to get back to his tree!In sum, this movie felt FAR longer than it actually was. Some movies are so bad, that they are enjoyable in a laughable way... This was actually so bad that it wasn&#x27;t good, it was just worse than you can imagine.	1
Schlock and Sputter	United States	Birdemic: Shock and Terror has made a splash in the underground community of masochists that enjoy atrocious cinema. With a tag line of &#x22;Why did the eagles and vultures attacked?&#x22; people have mistakenly believed this is the newest &#x22;so bad its good&#x22; title. As evidenced by the midnight screening I attended, these people are or will be very disappointed. The incompetence on display here is remarkable. Director James Nguyen has no idea of simply techniques like: writing a coherent story, including sound in every shot, knowing when to end shots, or incorporation of special effects. Nguyen is a Vietnamese immigrant and had no training of any kind in filmmaking. He was apparently inspired to create this film due to his affection for The Birds.The film opens with an extended driving sequence where the camera hovers at an odd angle for no reason. It is tilted slightly to the right for almost eight minutes before anything at all happens. It&#x27;s almost a loving homage to the opening of Manos: The Hands of Fate, which was also directed by someone who had no idea of how to make movies. After this unbearable sequence, we are introduced to the main character, Rod. He works for a technology company and has apparently earned stock options. He notifies us of his success about every ten minutes and uses it as a way to pick up an attractive fashion model named Natalie. This was the first role for both actors and they are so artificial in their delivery, it&#x27;s as if Nguyen told them to eliminate any emotion their characters should have experienced. Whitney Moore, who plays Natalie, appears to have a little bit of acting ability. She at least smiles sometimes.The first half of the movie contains no bird attacks. This is the &#x22;romantic&#x22; part of the movie, if you could call it such. Nguyen insists calling his movie a &#x22;romantic thriller&#x22; instead of a horror movie. For seemingly no reason at all, eagles and vultures interrupt the couple while they have sex without removing their clothes. These creatures are floating GIF images and hover over the screen. They are so poorly incorporated into the live action that they never actually give the presence of third dimensionality. They are stuck to the frame until the next scene begins. This is amusing for about five minutes and then becomes monotonous, not only because of the repetition of seeing the birds but also because a looping chirp plays whenever they are on screen. We later learn the birds are attacking because global warming has somehow affected them. I honestly cannot recall what the explanation was in detail because I had difficulty hearing it. Nguyen didn&#x27;t use anything to amplify dialog, so you will strain to hear what characters are saying most of the time.Birdemic is an unusually bad, bad movie. It&#x27;s a lack of imagination mixed with a lack of technical competence only made worse by a runtime of an hour and a half. If that wasn&#x27;t enough to ensure its infamy, promotional material listed it as &#x22;Bidemic&#x22;. It&#x27;s actually worse than the TV sequel to Hitchcock&#x27;s film that was later disowned by its director.Not Recommended	2
Top Forty Things I Took From Birdemic	United States	1. Angry birds do, in fact, drop bombs. Only, they explode. Literally. I&#x27;m not kidding.2. Shock and Terror? Check and Check.3. All film class&#x27;s first assignment should be a full length movie, such as Birdemic, so by the semester&#x27;s end you can see why you really did need the class.4. Make that, if Birdemic was your intro film, then go ahead and pay for the same course for another three semesters. Actually, just drop out.5. Repeating a 30sec music track in order to fill up a 4min opening credit screen does not deserve a &#x22;Music by&#x22; recognition.6. Sometimes 20-minute films that stem from a 2-minute idea can, sadly, be stretched to 90 minutes.7. If Hitchcock was resurrected to watch this remake: &#x27;Birds,&#x27; he&#x27;d only sue the people who brought him back.8. To close a $1,000,000 sales call, simply thank them for their business, hang up and smile.9. To persuade investors to give $10 million dollars, a one-slide PowerPoint presentation should seal the deal. Remember just to keep pointing at it for emphasis.10. Kids prefer HappyMeals&#x99; over seaweed. Go figure.11. Nintendo&#x27;s DuckHunt not only had better graphics, but actually produced more realistic birds (and guns) in &#x22;combat.&#x22;12. No real birds were harmed in the production. I repeat: No real birds&#x85;13. Al Gore not only changed his stance on GlobalWarming following Birdemic&#x27;s release, but he spit on Director/Writer Nguyen before converting to Republicanism.14. At least Tommy Wiseau&#x27;s The Room was trying to be funny. At least Piranha3D knew what kind of movie it was.15. As bad of actors that were in this feature, they must&#x27;ve learned something for acting scared of these &#x22;birds&#x22; that were as menacing as finches. 16. Sure, it&#x27;s billed as a Birds redux&#x85;it&#x27;s just as much a Beauty &#x26; the Beast remake: Just check out daughter, Nathalie and her monster of a mother. 17. At least M. Night does make the effort to edit something. 18. Twilight now seems surprisingly more romantic. 19. I don&#x27;t have the $10,000 budget this movie had, but if I did, I&#x27;d sooner risk it on one pull of a slot machine than what this movie would net. 20. My guess is: whenever the director yelled &#x22;Cut!&#x22; or &#x22;That&#x27;s a Wrap!&#x22; the actors, were seeing the connection to their future. 21. It&#x27;s sad when, while laughing as hard as possible at a movie, you still think this would have worked perfect&#x85;as a 15-second Family Guy cutaway. 22. SYFY Channel Productions is in the process of suing for deformation of character. 23. Wearing green does not equate going green. Heck, it&#x27;s not even a believable subliminal message. 24. Not all blame can be put upon the director. These actors did appear to be conscious. 25. $5/gallon for gas this summer? Ha! Call me when it becomes $100/gallon. 26. In a post-apocalyptic world, credit cards work just fine. 27. A movie about mysterious/unexplained &#x22;bird&#x22; attacks needs some time to get to that. The first 50 minutes out of 90 should be just the right about of time to watch people drive, turn left, fill up their gas tank, dance to a cruise-ship reject singer, fall in love in conjunction with making fake love in a motel, make one company rich enough to sell while simultaneously building another from scratch and land a Victoria Secret gig. 28. MST3k wouldn&#x27;t know where to begin. 29. If someone tries to steal your gas can, simply wait until they, without cause, begin walking backwards, from you and their own getaway car, so the &#x22;birds&#x22; can &#x22;ironically&#x22; take them out.30. Knocking off $1,000 off a $20,000 home solar panel is a steal. 31. Using two different Thai restaurant fronts in two simultaneous shots doesn&#x27;t just equate a mistake; it makes you stupid. 32. &#x22;And on with the traffic report: &#x27;Well, traffic is running smoothly on Cabrillo Highway, but make sure you watch out for tons of cars on the shoulder that contains what looks like moving dead people. No&#x85;heh&#x85;they&#x27;re not zombies, but even if they were, the couple with the toy guns should take care of them.&#x27;&#x22; 33. Find yourself under attack from &#x22;birds&#x22; but that darned tourist bus just isn&#x27;t holding up? Well, listen to a stranger and gather your thoughts in the fresh air, under the blue sky&#x85;in plain view of the very birds you&#x27;re trying to avoid. 34. If a &#x22;bird scientist&#x22; tells you to stand back, simply walk up to him and just ask him to talk. It will throw him so far off, he&#x27;ll have no choice in attempting to fill some plot holes in your movie. Unsuccessfully&#x85;but still. 35. Dialogue should never be plagiarized from Bazooka Joe Comics. 36. Sound effects and boom mics should be used to enhance the feature, not cause further ridicule. 37. These &#x22;birds&#x22; seem more bent on revenge than Jaws did in his fourth installment. 38. Long before Birdemic was made and someone asked the director when it was supposed to be made, his response should&#x27;ve been: The Day After Tomorrow&#x85;repeatedly. 39. &#x22;Why can&#x27;t we just give peace a chance?&#x22; is not a good movie quote in this weapon of mass destruction of a film that should&#x27;ve been dropped over the Taliban. 40. Dissecting this movie on every&#x85;single&#x85;flaw is only fruitless to anyone other than a film school teacher &#x96; believe me, it would take me HOURS to scrutinize everything wrong here. Instead: grab a beer or thirty, gather some friends and laugh away an hour and a half of purely hilarious entertainment.	1
utter crap.	United Kingdom	OK, first off i love bad movies. Hell of the living dead, birds of prey zombie 2,3,4,5 burial ground, nightmare city... OK you get the idea, so when I saw the trailer for birdemic I honestly HAD to see this movie. Finally I got a copy and sat down ready to laugh my ass off, instead I got bored, horribly horribly bored. Don&#x27;t believe the hype people, this movie IS NOT so bad its good, its utter f*****g rubbish. For over half an hour of tedium I sat there as talentless actor gets in car, talentless actor gets out of car, talentless actor described his successful career in sales, talentless actor preaches enivronmentalism.... then i switched it off. No killer birds, no laughs and i was not at any point entertained this movie was just a complete waste of time and the money used to make this garbage could have been used to feed starving children. If you want a cheesy killer bird movie, watch Rene cardone Jr&#x27;s Beaks (aka birds of prey) or if you want a great killer bird movie watch Hitchcock&#x27;s classic the birds, just avoid this like the plague, watching it makes you stupid and the director makes uwe boll look talented.	1
This movie saved my life	New York	I was in a coma, I couldn&#x27;t have kids and my wife was dead. This movie was played in my hospital room. As the end credits began to roll (and didn&#x27;t finish for three hours) two healthy baby boys, Rod and Nathalie, sprung forth from my tummy. I was then awakened from my coma, jumped from my bed (children in my arms) and proceeded to fly out of the hospital room with the swiftness of 1000 birds. I flew to my wife&#x27;s grave and promptly resurrected her. I then, in turn, saved an orphan run bank from a fire. I adopted all 44 orphans and named them all after the characters in this wonderful film (I have the same number of children as there are actors in the film, but because I needed that number I did not adopt two of the orphans). Then I took my wife and children and we mimicked the lifestyle of my favorite character from the film, Tree Hugger. All in all I&#x27;d give this movie 10 stars and my left foot. If I could I would sell my children into slavery in order to watch this movie again having never seen it before.	10
Definitely on the best of the worst list	United States	Let&#x27;s be honest, if you even got as far as reading this review, then you&#x27;re not looking for a good movie, so there&#x27;s a good chance Birdemic is the movie for you. On the other hand, let me give you some practical advice; just start the movie at minute 47, because nothing of any real importance happens in the first half. It&#x27;s entirely spent establishing an implausible relationship between a Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a hot fashion model and a Rod (Alan Bagh), computer geek. I know this sort of thing is a staple in horror and sci fi movies, but usually the nerd has some hidden charms. Rod is basically just annoying and full of himself. Also, the relationship normally develops in the context of the plot and involves at least *some* dramatic tension. In this case, they meet and she is immediately swept off her feet by his complete lack of charm and affected speech patterns. Oh yeah, he&#x27;s also just landed a big business deal that will make him a millionaire. So much more Nathalie&#x27;s wholesome image, the little gold digger! Anyway, this whole process takes about 5 minutes. Where the other 40 go is a mystery. OK, they do find one dead bird on the beach. Consider yourself foreshadowed.On second thought, start at minute 44 to catch the movie&#x27;s only redeeming feature: a gratuitous slow pan of Moore in her underwear. But then *immediately* jump to minute 47 to escape the most awkward and unconvincing love scene in the history of cinema. Don&#x27;t say you haven&#x27;t been warned.Then the action starts. After a night of passion, they awake to a full scale attack by badly rendered CGI birds which terrorize people and occasionally dive bomb the ground, exploding on impact. I don&#x27;t mean they burst apart in a shower of bird guts; I mean they actually explode, with fire and smoke, like little Kamikazee pilots! This is never explained.And that&#x27;s pretty much it. The rest of the movie is basically spent running from these birds and occasionally fighting them off - first with coat hangers and later with the the stash of firearms and (almost) limitless ammo that one character inexplicably produces. Sometimes there&#x27;s a variation on the explosion theme where the birds splatter people with something that appears to burn them like acid. They run into a couple of people in their travels who explain this is all caused by global warming. This shameless pandering to social relevance loses any sympathy the film maker might otherwise have had. Also, I can believe that climate change might make birds aggressive, but could it really make them explode?Just how bad an actor is Alan Bagh? Well, it should tell you something that he couldn&#x27;t project any credible passion in a love scene with our scantily clad heroine. His dialog is delivered in a uniform stilted monotone, and he seems to avoid eye contact with either the camera or any of his fellow actors. In fact, even the scenes when he and Moore are walking in silence - and there are an annoyingly large number of these - are somehow not at all believable. I mean seriously, how hard is it to *walk* in a convincing manner? If I saw someone walking like that on the street, I would assume he had suffered some sort of head trauma.Almost all of the actors are more or less equivalent to Bagh, with the arguable exception of Moore. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, she&#x27;s not great, but since she&#x27;s the only person in the movie with any acting ability whatsoever, she comes across like Merryl Streep. Really, you find yourself longing for her speaking parts, because it&#x27;s the only dialog that&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t literally make you cringe. Also, did I mention she&#x27;s got a gratuitous underwear scene at minute 44?A lot has been said about the poor quality of the CGI birds, but nothing can prepare you for how bad they really are. If Ed Wood had made this movie, he would have interspersed stock footage of flocks of birds with stuffed birds thrown in from off screen - and the result would have been much, much more effective!Anyway, since they&#x27;re worried about bird attacks, you would think they would, I don&#x27;t know, stay indoors! By no, they&#x27;re outside as much as possible. Part of this is because in the one day since the birds attacked civilization has completely crumbled, and they&#x27;re forced to forage for food. Just when you&#x27;re continuing to wonder how they&#x27;re going to end this this thing, the birds simply fly away, with no explanation. Huh?Truly, a masterpiece.	1
Bad as bad is bad	Brisbane, Australia	Every now and again, I read a review on this site of a film where the person says things like, &#x22;it&#x27;s the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen!&#x22;, when it might indeed be pretty ordinary, but not really one star basis. My thought is usually, &#x22;You really don&#x27;t know what &#x27;bad&#x27; is, do you?&#x22; &#x22;Birdemic: Shock And Terror&#x22; is bad. It is as bad as what people say it is. It is almost unbelievably bad, and I can believe a lot. It is gobsmackingly awful - this coming from a fan of Ed Wood.Rod and Nathalie are two former schoolmates who happen to come across each other, and proceed to fall in love, also happening to find out that they just happen to have neutral fans who also just happen to be in love.Nothing occurs in the first half of the film. Nothing. After the opening credits, where a tinny tune is played on a continuous loop, we are treated to deadening acting (although, in defense, Whitney Moore isn&#x27;t too bad), atrocious dialogue, horrible sound and dreadful editing. This all makes it vastly entertaining, for those who are fascinated by such ineptness.After this first half of routine and dreadful drama, the birds start attacking. Just like that. There are a couple of references to strange things happening in nature earlier but, really, it could have all just been a &#x27;straight&#x27; (so to speak) love story beforehand.It could be that filmmaker James Nguyen, a self-proclaimed Hitchcock fan, tried to take a leaf out of the Master&#x27;s book here, where Hitch sometimes had his thrillers trundle along in an unalarming way for a while until, almost casually, things would start to happen and, before we knew it, the thrills were on.The difference is, of course, that Hitchcock did it with style, wit and panache.To say the birds attack is a very loose statement. In reality, they are superimposed on the screen, bouncing up and down, while the actors wave various articles at them. When one thinks about it, this is not really very surprising. If a scene of two people talking in a restaurant can&#x27;t be handled above the level of complete incompetence, how could we expect more from the special effects later? As we go on, our heroes fire guns, with unlimited ammunition, at the birds, while driving around aimlessly, trying to help others, including picking up two children.These children have just seen their mother killed by the birds. And yet, before long, they&#x27;re sitting in the back seat of the car playing computer games, and demanding Happy Meals! Other people get killed by birds suddenly flying past them, and seeming to clip them with their beaks or claws, which is enough to drop them on the spot.And the ending. The ending... It&#x27;s utter meaninglessness suits the film perfectly. As someone who is fascinated by true badness (not just in movies), &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; transcends such things for me. Everything that could possibly be wrong in filmmaking (again, with the possible exception of Moore) is on display here. Everything. Maybe one day, Tim Burton will do a sequel to &#x22;Ed Wood&#x22; and call it &#x22;James Nguyen&#x22;, although it would be harder to pronounce. But surely it would be worth the admission price.	1
Where Do I Start?	United States	I don&#x27;t know where to begin, so I&#x27;ll say this. I&#x27;ve heard The Room reviewed as the &#x22;Citizen Kane&#x22; of bad movies. After watching Birdemic: Shock and Terror, The Room will actually seem as good as Citizen Kane.Birdemic: Shock and Terror is a cult film waiting to happen. The low budget, the amateur cast and crew, the goofy, hole-ridden plot, but what this movie has that classic cult films like The Room and Troll 2 for example don&#x27;t, is a complete ineptitude from the standpoint of all involved in this movie. I could watch Troll 2 and The Room, and I could picture in some alternate dimension that everything that was wrong with those movies was tweaked and they actually weren&#x27;t half bad, but Birdemic: Shock and Terror is different.First of all, the editing in this movie is worse than your average high schooler&#x27;s film studies project. Almost every perspective change in a scene is accompanied with a long, awkward pause and an obvious change in sound, even on the television. I&#x27;m pretty sure the director/producer/writer of this atrocity (James Nguyen) just used the built-in mic on his digital camcorder. Also, every scene is shot with a pan to the right. Believe it or not though, if there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ll give credit to in this film, is the music. It&#x27;s actually decent, considering the small budget. The song played during the (awful) bar scene comes to mind because it&#x27;s really catchy and actually has some really good musicianship. However, the film score is often repeated, and in the case of the beginning credits, is obnoxiously repeated.Next, the plot and writing. If you haven&#x27;t seen the movie, the plot is that an aspiring software salesman meets a girl and they hit it off, only to have their wonderful love be cut short by killer birds. The plot is somewhat coherent, as it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out what&#x27;s going on with the love story, and it&#x27;s also pretty clear &#x22;why did the eagles and vultures attacked&#x22; (quoting a movie flier made by Nguyen himself). Thankfully, there aren&#x27;t any subplots in the movie, unless you count the career ventures the characters make pretty early in the movie, which brings me to the writing.In the pile of steaming crap that is this movie, this has to be the smelliest part. Nguyen was inspired by two movies supposedly: Hitchcock&#x27;s &#x22;The Birds&#x22; and Al Gore&#x27;s &#x22;An Inconvenient Truth.&#x22; I read about that before I watched the movie, and I had a hard time thinking how those two could be combined, then I watched this film. The most out of place, out of context plugs for unrealistic &#x22;green&#x22; technology (absurdly cheap solar panels, 100 mpg Ford Mustang) can are uttered in this movie to the point where it&#x27;s almost offensive. This is a part of the movie that you need to see to believe because I&#x27;d easily be over the word limit if I had to describe all these scenes.Finally, we&#x27;ll talk about the acting. There&#x27;s not much to say here, except that they aren&#x27;t good actors. Thankfully, we don&#x27;t see awkward characters or overacting like in other bad films that have acquired cult rating, but we do see bad actors nonetheless. I honestly don&#x27;t feel like I can make a true judgement of their acting because of the terrible script and editing, but I can only imagine what I&#x27;d think if I got a &#x22;true&#x22; performance from them. If I had to pick the top 3 actors in this film, I&#x27;d pick the &#x22;tree-hugger,&#x22; Nathalie, and the nightclub singer.Basically, I suggest you watch this movie. This is probably the worst feature-length film of all time, and I&#x27;ve seen some bad films.	1
A Must-See Comedy!!!	United States	OK, yes this movie is terrible, but it&#x27;s still enjoyable. It&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s good!! If you&#x27;re the kind of person who can appreciate movies like Troll 2 and The Rocky Horror Picture Show, then you&#x27;ll love this movie. There&#x27;s so many things to make fun of; the terrible acting, the weak plot, the locations, the sound equipment and goofy CGI effects are all worth a look. This movie is so bad, it&#x27;s good! Seriously!! If you want a good time, get some snacks and buddies and watch this movie. The wisecracks will never end. You&#x27;ll be amazed how many useless characters just pop up out of nowhere for the sole purpose of explaining the plot. You won&#x27;t believe how much gun ammunition the main characters have to shoot at birds but no food. This movie is ridiculous, but if you have a sense of humor or are a filmmaker and want a guide on what NOT to do...SEE THIS MOVIE!!	1
10 out of 10 best movie ever	Remote island, Pluto	I just want to say that this is the best movie ev- hahahaha - I can&#x27;t keep this up... to tell the truth, this is not a well made movie but watching it was one of the best times I ever had with my friends. It was so bad that it was funny, you really should watch it with your friends so you can laugh at it together. Because of this movie, my friends and I even started a small group to watch bad movies and laugh. This is definitely the best worst movie I have ever seen. But it was very fun to watch and never got boring because of all the mistakes and the bad screenplay. Not to mention the actors... So thank you Nguyen for your horrible sound editing, absolutely emotionless main character (Bagh) and ABSOLUTELY horrible birds. You really did a (horribly) great job. THANK YOU!	10
Was this thing made by retarded school children?	United States	The audio sucks, camera work is erratic, dialog is painfully delivered. Script must have been written in crayon. Establishing shots held way way way too long. Action starts way way too late. Foley is sad, CGI is hilarious.....Were they trying to kill the art of film? The lack of acting skill reminds me of a 3rd grade Christmas play.By FAR the worst movie EVER.Even the Rifftrax version was hard to watch....The only believable actor was the little girl. What is with the fully auto M-16? None of the people in the other cars seem to notice the attacking birds.THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!	1
Bad ripoff of Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds	United States	SPOILER ALERT. Possibly. I don&#x27;t want to be on the blacklistJames Nguyen&#x27;s fantastically bad remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1963 masterpiece is truly one of the great cinematic tragedies of the 21st Century. From awful camera-work to stony acting to crappy dialogue to the incoherent and ridiculous plot, from the craptastic .gif birds that don&#x27;t do anything to the repetitive loop of the squawking, everything about this movie screams &#x22;just kill me&#x22;. This movie takes the shitty film quality in found footage and makes it shittier. On top of all of this, there is a weak and bizarre forced environmentalist message that claims the birds are sentient and punish humans because of global warming or some bullshit like this. Save yourself the trouble and don&#x27;t watch this worthless piece of crap.	1
Shock and Terror is completely right.	United States	Last night, I went to a local movie rental store with my grandparents to rent some movies to watch. We rented two movies. First, we rented Saving Mr. Banks. It&#x27;s a fantastic movie, I suggest you watch it. Second, we rented this. This was more for my pleasure because I knew neither of them would like it. So, this morning, I sat down and saw it. Oh boy&#x85; This movie stars a guy named Rod. He&#x27;s your average marketer until he meets the girl of his dreams. They go out for a little bit, and then all of a sudden, a huge swarm of birds attacks the city! And that is literally the entire plot. The story is just so random. It&#x27;s almost like a really crappy sitcom for a while then BIRDS! HOLY CRAP BIRDS! What I love most about the &#x22;plot&#x22; of this movie is that the first forty minutes or so is completely worthless. This movie is about birds attacking the series, so why is there so much relationship and work drama? Plus, there are scenes that don&#x27;t make sense. For example, at one point in the movie, a guy goes to the main character&#x27;s house about making a deal to install a solar panel to the house. What does that have to do with the plot? Absolutely nothing. Nothing new was added to the plot, none of this is ever mentioned again, so&#x85; why? What&#x27;s the point? The cinematography is absolute crap. The camera never steadies and focuses on the right thing. Every shot looks like it belongs in a home movie. There are some shots that feel completely random and just out of place. It just looks awful. The editing is even worse. The scene transitions are beyond choppy with so many, many jump cuts. There are literally four jump cuts in the same exact scene at one point. Plus, this movie has that audio static you get when recording with a low budget camera, only in this movie between every scene the level of static changes. And sometimes it goes away altogether. Hey Nguyen- I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve ever heard of this before. It&#x27;s called a boom-mike? It&#x27;s really neat! It makes all the sound sound much crisper without all that audio static. But I see you wasted your entire 10 dollar budget on CGI, so what&#x27;s the point of telling you this? Speaking of CGI&#x85; ugh&#x85; the CGI is poop! It&#x27;s the kind of bad that you can&#x27;t describe just because of the sheer amount of awful it withholds. It&#x27;s just&#x85; bad. All the CGI is put into birds, explosions, and blood effects. Do you think you could&#x27;ve tried a little harder? The birds are absolutely ridiculous. Not only are they animated like crap, but they just make no sense. These birds literally dive-bomb towards the city, kamikaze style, and explode on impact. Also, they have no actual entrance or exit in the movie. After forty minutes of the bullcrap that is the story, the birds just appear and start attacking everybody. No explanation why, they just do. And at the end, they just fly away like it&#x27;s nothing. There&#x27;s no reason why they should. There&#x27;s no indication of anything that happens that would drive the birds away. This plot hole makes the movie all the more pointless. Now I have to touch on the acting. The acting rendered me speechless. Wooden does not begin to describe the acting. Everyone seems like they&#x27;re phoning it in, and even that is being too generous. Everyone does an absolutely awful job. Especially the main character. He brings a whole new level of awful to the table. I&#x27;ve seen better acting from the people that are in the home videos on AFV. And they aren&#x27;t even acting! I just&#x85; I&#x85; I can&#x27;t! I can&#x27;t do this! Overall, Birdemic Shock and Terror is horrendous. The acting sucks, the CGI sucks, the story (or what little there is, anyway) sucks, there are scenes that make no sense, the cinematography looks like it was done by a toddler, the audio is grating, the characters are annoying, everything just sucks! And do you know what the cherry on top is? THIS MOVIE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL MESSAGE. I&#x27;m serious. The characters in the movie say that &#x22;global warming&#x22; is the cause of all this. Bullcrap! What a cop-out! In terms of quality, this movie is definitely the worst movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. I still like it better than Battlefield Earth, though. Score: 1.0/10	1
The best worst movie ever.	United Kingdom	Birdemic is undoubtedly the worst piece of film-making I have had the pleasure of viewing. Everything about it is badly done: from the sound that clips in and out; the spotty lighting; the weird camera work, the stunted, jarring, awkward dialogue; the &#x22;CGI&#x22; and the total complete utter lack of anything somewhat resembling a plot. However, all of this comes together to create a really entertaining watch. Provided you have a few friends and don&#x27;t attempt to take it seriously, this movie will make you cry with laughter. Its truly an achievement that the movie is so consistently bad, in such a consistently hilarious way.Everyone should watch this masterpiece. Not only will you have a great time, and learn lots about how global warming really works, but you will then appreciate how good other movies really are.	10
I felt my brain melting and eyes aching	Norway	When a movie starts with music that grinds your ears, standard movie- maker font, 10 minutes of random shots from the valleys of Hollywood and an unknown B-movie director that claims he&#x27;s the &#x22;master of romantic thrillers&#x22;, you know you&#x27;re in for one hell of a ride. I don&#x27;t really know if this movie is a joke or not, if they actually went in full force with the intention of actually making a great film with their 10.000 dollar budget, clearly they did not. When the actual film starts, the camera is so horrid I thought the cameraman was drunk, or if I was unwillingly intoxicated. Anyways, I had to check my earphones after a couple of minutes, because the sound suddenly stopped and popped up at random, looks like the sound-mixer of this movie probably is deaf or some sort of modern day Hellen Keller. Let&#x27;s say something about the acting.. if there is any. I felt my heart wrenching when the protagonist started reading his lines, his act is already so wooden after two minutes of screen-time he&#x27;d fit right in the Ents from the &#x22;Lord of the Rings&#x22;-trilogy. When an actor can&#x27;t even walk straight without showing signs of having something rectangular shoved up his rectum, there&#x27;s something wrong.After about 45 minutes of clapping (yes, see it for yourself), a love story that makes the Twilight-saga seem like &#x22;The Notebook&#x22; and &#x22;Titanic&#x22; combined, dialouges that are from another planet and all-in- all all I&#x27;m thinking: Is this movie the &#x22;Shock and Terror&#x22; the sub-title proclamates? &#x27;Cause I haven&#x27;t seen a f*cking bird yet!!When the birds arrive.. No, I don&#x27;t even care to write about it.. I feel ashamed of myself. I feel like laying down in the shower with my clothes on and cry while the cold water is running on full.This movie basically makes Tommy Wiseau&#x27;s &#x22;The Room&#x22; seem like the new &#x22;Schindler&#x27;s List&#x22;. Enough said.	1
Among the best of the worst	None	Oh boy.When I first saw this movie, I couldn&#x27;t contain my laughter. You&#x27;re greeted with 40 minutes of absolutely nothing important AT ALL, and suddenly, birds.That are fixed to the camera.Through all the horrible editing, crappy sound quality, wooden acting, terrible effects, pointless scenes and ear-bleeding sound effects, this is way up there among the best of the worst, along with The Room, Troll 2 and Plan 9 From Outer Space.I definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good laugh.	8
Most amazing piece of garbage Ive ever had the pleasure of seeing	United States	Shocking and terrorizing is right. I don&#x27;t even know where to begin. All I can say is it has the worst editing, worst sound, worst acting, worst directing, worst special effects, worst story, and worst ending ever told. However it is by far the most breathtaking failure I&#x27;ve ever seen. It&#x27;s like watching a work of art by Picasso created with dog poop and vomit under sewage water. Maybe that&#x27;s what makes it fun to watch because of its honesty in trying to make a horror film with very limited resources. The pacing is atrocious though in that you will finally see the birds attack about 45 minutes through the movie and the birds look like Windows 95 screen savers. The sound editing...it&#x27;s like every shot you will hear the difference in the background noise and by the time you see them &#x22;firing&#x22; guns your ears will explode due to the intensity of the sound. Forget about the plot because it doesn&#x27;t even need one. All in all I can say it&#x27;s a great movie to laugh at even when you are not drunk.	4
This is what happen if The Birds wasnt directed by Alfred Hitchcock, but a crazy fan of his	United States	Failure &#x96;noun 1. an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success: 2. nonperformance of something due, required, or expected: 3. James Nguyen&#x27;s &#x22;Birdemic&#x22;. Birdemic is just plan awful. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t even belong in the &#x27;it&#x27;s so bad, it&#x27;s good&#x27; group of bad movies. It&#x27;s lacks any sense of entertainment. At first, I thought this was a student film, due to it&#x27;s windows movie maker CGI effects, wooden acting, audio conflict and bad editing shots, but no, this movie was just produce by James Nguyen, the modern day Ed Wood with Tippi Hedren serving as his Bela Lugusi. He never received any formal training in movie-making, but instead grew up watching the movies of Alred Hitchcock, including his 1963 picture &#x27;The birds&#x27;. It took the director four years to make this movie, and it&#x27;s still awful. Please James Nguyen, learn how to make a movie, please. Birdemic: Shock and Terror starts with the shocking and terrifying Rod (Alan Bagh) who the camera loves to show driving and walking over loop music, badly made sound effects, or blank silence. Rod meets up with aspiring fashion model Nathalie (Whitney Moore) and begins dating her. The dialogue between the two wooden actors are just bad. It&#x27;s like a hurricane blew through the script and devastated every line in it&#x27;s path. The whole idea of the two main characters being a couple is just awkward as both have no connection with each other, it felt like the actress didn&#x27;t really wanted to be there. The whole love story is just painfully to watch due to it&#x27;s dullish. The first part of the movie is so boring with non needed scenes, bad fade in and fade outs, and long pauses when cuts are needed. Most of the audience is just waiting for the birds to attack and kill these folks just because the movie need some type of entertaining value. Rod and Nathalie woke up to find that their town Half Moon Bay is under attack from CGI photoshop eagles and vultures that spit acid, disappear in end of shots and explode into flames upon striking the ground. I&#x27;m not a naturalist like Charles Darwin, but I don&#x27;t think birds explode or spit acid due to Global Warning effects. The movie love to mention Global Warning, but doesn&#x27;t really do a good job on explaining it. They even had a badly written doctor on a bridge to try to explain it, and he wouldn&#x27;t do the job. Even Al Gore would hate this movie. The whole plot is directless, and the movie tries to pay tribute to &#x27;The Birds&#x27;, but felt like a cheap knock off of that. The sound is horrible, there are scenes where the movie go silence, yet in others, such as the one at the beaches. The sound of the waves crashing, makes the movie hard to hear. Don&#x27;t get me started on the annoying sound during the attack, and things rubbing against the microphone. Oh god the bird screams, my ears are bleeding. I wasn&#x27;t even aware it was possible to fail this badly. It fails as a romance and it really fails as a horror flick. I try to look for any good notes for the film, and I can&#x27;t find anything worth noting. That&#x27;s how bad, I dislike this film. I can&#x27;t believe that they are even thinking of making a 2nd movie: Birdemic 2: The Resurrection. Birdemic is just pure cinematic failure on absolutely every conceivable level. I&#x27;m surprised it wasn&#x27;t written, produced, directed and starred in by Alan Smithee. This movie makes Troll 2 look like Orson Welles &#x27;Citizen Kane&#x27; or Tommy Wiseau &#x27;The Room&#x27; look like Godfather. Check it out at your own cost. It&#x27;s worth watching if you like your eyes prick by GIF clip-art birds.	1
Wretched	Earth (Middle)	Easily in the class of worst movies ever made, Birdemic has obsoletely nothing to recommend it other than a hilarious send-up of it by the folks at Rifftrax. The acting is horrible, the script is a mess of confusion, the directing is worse, and the special effects look like they were done by an 8yo on an old Quadra 660av. The movie lacks all the charm of something like Plan 9 From Outer Space and fits in well with dreck like Manos The Hand of Fate.If at all possible, avoid seeing this film. Drive many miles out of your way if need be.Even if you like bad movies in general, this movie will test your limits.	1
How did no one prevent this abomination from coming into being?	None	A lot of things have been said about this movie, I read most of the reviews, but nothing could prepare me for the clogged toilet full of sh*t that is birdemic. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I think you should see it, but it is truly the worst movie EVER.Okay the CGI is HORRIBLE, the sound transitions between scenes are so bad you will think somebody switched the channel and none of the actors have any real talent. The plot is more made up of mistakes than an actual story, all characters are one dimensional and boring at best. The best part of the movie is the worst part of a porn movie, seeing the chick in her underwear.Why I still think you should watch this is because of the leading role, Rod (or whatever), played by Alan Bagh. I think a cardboard cutout of the &#x22;They&#x27;re eating her! And then they&#x27;re going to eat me! Oh my GOOOOOOOOD!&#x22;-guy from troll 2 (search it on youtube if you haven&#x27;t seen it) would do a better job than this guy. He can not do a single movement naturally, seriously everything he does looks ridiculous. EVERYTHING. He can&#x27;t walk, talk, get into a car or even stand still like a normal person.The first half hour of the movie (no birds yet) is hilarious because of him stumbling around like someone who is recovering from a severe stroke and had most of his brain removed. Moore tries to save it and she&#x27;s actually not half bad (okay she&#x27;s pretty bad but so much better than Bagh) but it just doesn&#x27;t work because she has to act like she likes him. HE IS THE MOST BORING ZERO-DIMENSIONAL C*CKSUCKER EVER WHY WOULD ANYONE GIVE A SH*T ABOUT HIS HOBBIES OR HIS STUPID JOB.The plot is total garbage of course, but what bothers me most is the TOTAL LACK OF SENSE on Nguyens part. At one point they find a dead bird on the beach, but instead of getting a dead chicken somewhere they use a CGI bird. IT LOOKS TERRIBLE. WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH A THING.This movie makes 2012: Ice Age look like Avatar. In comparison to this, Mega Shark Vs. Giant Octopus is worthy of 10 Oscars. It is unbelievable that anyone would produce this, did no one with a milligram of sense and taste watch this before it was brought out? Nguyen and everyone he knows should be whipped severely for making this hell spawn of a movie.Bottom line: Go watch it and be amazed at the unbelievable amounts of incompetence one can show in just 90 minutes. Don&#x27;t forget your eye bleach!	1
I dont know what to say	United States	Really, I&#x27;m at a loss. What can be said about a movie like Birdemic? All the reviews you can find detail the innumerable problems: the poor directing, the lack of consistent sound quality (including the famous &#x22;HI&#x22; from the waitress at the beginning), the crappy GIFs of birds sloppily pasted over the screen, which spit acidic orange juice and explode and make airplane noises, acting worse than the average porno, etc.But does this movie really deserve review? A review of a movie implies that it is.....well, a professional film. Birdemic is listed on a site alongside The Godfather and Avatar, and it received a theatrical release. But it doesn&#x27;t seem right. This movie simply does not exist in the same realm as what anyone would call a &#x22;movie.&#x22; It dips down into the 90s era of home movies, manufactured by a few high schoolers in the summer with a pirated copy of Adobe Aftereffects.What I&#x27;m saying is that to review this film on IMDb almost implies that it deserves being on the same 1 to 10 rating scale used for the rest of the films on this site. The rating scale doesn&#x27;t apply because it&#x27;s just not made like a movie.	1
Does anyone know how to erase memories?	United Kingdom	I cant quite begin to explain the magnitude of why this film is most definitely the most diabolical example of cinematography I have ever seen in my life....It started when a group of my friends stumbled across the trailer. After watching we thought &#x22;man this film looks so bad it must be worth a watch even if its to laugh at!&#x22; But oh no people this is not a film so bad its good... its just plain dreadful, and if any of you have seen the trailer then I say to you that its even worse than it looks(somehow, which I could never have dreamed was possible).Lets state the obvious: The acting was disastrous. I really hope these actors got paid in barley water or some other worthless item. I have seen primary school plays with more conviction. Any emotion that could have been displayed in the romantic scenes was so clearly fake its unreal. I mean the actors couldn&#x27;t even pretend to shoot properly, they just vaguely lifted up their guns and threw them about. Now this is probably something to do with the fact that this is without a doubt the worse example of the use of CGI in the history of man. I think men in bird suits would have done a better job. The birds were so fake they quite literally moved exactly with the camera as if stuck on even though they were done by computer!As for the story line I&#x27;m not sure how or why James Nguyen thought of the reasons given in the film but they are barely worth mentioning. And why there was a seemingly random crusade about global warming is beyond me as it made no sense as to why it was causing the birds to attack. Even worse than this was the little details. For example multiple times in the film the main cast decided to get out of their car and begin strolling around having picnics, without a care in the world. Then surprise surprise birds attacked. If the writer cannot think of legitimate reasons for the characters action he should perhaps go back to the drawing board (all though I&#x27;m pretty sure he spent about 5 seconds pondering if he could get away with this excuse for a screenplay). Now the not so obvious stuff: In the trailer you don&#x27;t even get a sense for how terrible the editing is. Events seem to occur at random times and in some scenes you can see the actors waiting for the director to shout &#x22;action!&#x22; (no joke you really can its like their all zombified for a few seconds, and this doesn&#x27;t happen just once!). When it comes to the lyrical component of the film you might as well give up now. Every few seconds back ground noise would change from complete silence to over powering fuzz where some shots were so obviously done at different times. It was like the actors were in different rooms, it was mad!Now the ending is possibly the worse bit. I wont completely ruin it but all in all the birds go away. That&#x27;s it! Why, we will never know.So unless you are on crack cocaine, are thinking of doing something slightly more fun than suicide or just plain out of your mind, please, I beg of you, don&#x27;t watch this film. No seriously don&#x27;t! You will wind up like me wishing that you had kicked your own mother&#x27;s head in or done some other task that was of more value than watching Birdemic.One last thought: How does flu make birds explode?	1
You have to see it to believe it!	United States	I love bad movies and watching bad movies. I was really excited to see birdemic because all the bad reviews I have heard. The first word that was said in this movie pretty much told me what i was in for. At the beginning of this movie I was excited to see a really crappy movie and make me laugh hard. I was terribly wrong. By the first hour I just wanted the movie to end. Not only the audio was the worst I have ever heard, the editing was a joke, the lighting was awful but besides all that it was terribly boring the first about 30-40 minutes. What i was hoping to see was birds attacking people for the whole movie in really ridiculous ways but in the first 30-40 minutes the movie was just a day and the life of a really average and boring guy. The character&#x27;s acting didn&#x27;t help at all either. Not only was the character boring but I feel like the film could have been only 30 minutes long if there weren&#x27;t so many shots of useless and pointless shots, mainly of them main character driving! It was just shot after shot of a car entering and leaving a shot. The worst part of this movie is the audio. The audio was is the most noticeable part of the movie. There are times when the person isn&#x27;t talking but they are still talking, ambient sound volume was being changed every other second. It was as if sound mixer brought up audio only when a character was talking then brought the sound back down when they finished. The final verdict is that if you are someone that love to laugh at bad movies this might not be for you because its just way to bad, but if you have to watch it then watch it with a ton of people and make jokes during the movie. You will not believe how bad this movie is. Oh and one more thing, prepare for some really lame social commentary over global warming.	2
I am insulted that IMDb only gave this a 2 out of 10	Wisconsin	--- A 2 out of 10? I am INSULTED! Clearly this is the absolute worst movie I had to endure in over 20 years and I am positive the makers were trying very hard for a ZERO! And in MY book that is exactly what it got, a BIG F A T zero out of ten. --- I have no idea where to start with this example of a junior high school project that some how got picked up for rental production. The &#x22;eagles&#x22; and &#x22;hawks&#x22;, and I use those terms loosely, look like they were stolen out of some 80&#x27;s arcade video game. Their movement is one dimensional and have no other motion than to exist in the air with wings moving up and down. I have never known the eagles where I live to be able to hover in mid-air facing upward as if on a flag...very curious. --- Maybe I missed the part where someone was identified as an arms dealer, but suddenly the freaky eagles appear around the people and there are screams, &#x22;ooooh,&#x22; &#x22;eeeewwww,&#x22; &#x22;ahhhh...,&#x22; then someone has an idea. I swear I expected a light bulb to appear. The idea goes from thought to action...&#x22;hey, we are under attack by killer one dimensional birds. Here, take this automatic weapon I just happen to have in the back seat and open fire.&#x22; &#x22;Oh yeah and use the thousand round magazine I have in the gun too!&#x22; That is all I can stand to say about it. Oh wait, I just have to tell you to keep your eye out for those attack clothes hangers too. --- This is the first movie that I actually demanded a refund from Family Video over. I thought Alien vs Ninja was getting my waste of space award for the month but then this movie came along and blew Alien vs Ninja right out of the water. ---Alien vs Ninja = 02 , Birdemic = 00. When watched together they earn a solid -01 . Mathematical explanation (+02x00=-01)	1
My God,where do I begin?	United States	Well,well,I wish I knew where to start,but here goes: Young man works at some software company and strikes a million dollar deal.He runs into some blonde girl who he went to school with years ago and they hook up and begin a relationship.He meets her mom.Her mom thinks she should get a real estate job instead of being a lingerie model,but is happy for her when she gets to work for Victoria&#x27;s Secret.All of that happens in the first 45 minutes.They go out of town and get a room and then there are eagles hoovering outside their window and they make their escape.They meet another couple who happen to have machine guns or Uzis,which they never seem to run out of ammo and begin killing the birds.These birds fly around,attacking people and running into cars and exploding,but these birds look more like something you&#x27;d see on a video game than something truly horrifying..OK,I&#x27;ll stop there,but I have a few questions: When the couple stop on the side of the road when they see a guy with a cowboy hat,the guy wants their gas,but Rod(the &#x22;lead&#x22; actor)tells the man they need it.The guy has a gun and points it at Rod,so Rod goes to the back to get the gas and when the guy is ready to leave with the gas,a bird swoops by and kills him.Now,the gas canister is left behind.How come Rod didn&#x27;t get it,if he told the guy they needed the gas??..I noticed they seems pretty relaxed when they&#x27;re having a picnic out in the open.You have birds trying to kill you and you&#x27;re going to have a picnic OUT IN THE OPEN?? They couldn&#x27;t eat in the van instead? Much safer,especially if you have 2 kids with you,right? By the way,they got the kids from a vehicle whose family were killed by the birds before the man in the cowboy hat took their gas..I guess I could go on about the editing and the sound,but you have to see it for yourself..It is have been said that this is worse than Troll 2 and you know something? I believe them.You might agree as well..Enjoy!!	2
Worst film ever.	Chicago	It&#x27;s bad. Like really really bad. The only reason it got a sequel is (at least i think so) is because people had such a morbid fascination with the movie and found some sort of charm in its mixture of bad special effects, terrible acting and everything not nice that they had to make a second film to cash in on the fascination, but there is nothing in this film that actually warrants that at all, because it just doesn&#x27;t work as a solo watch and only as a drinking game movie that you and your friends can laugh at as a sad attempt to mask the suffering that you are actually having watching it. But for some reason it continues to be ranked as a movie that is so bad it&#x27;s good alongside such films as The Room and Plan 9 from Outer Space, but at least in those movies you could see the enjoyability in them and like them. But in this one, there is no enjoyability. P.S. Why is Gunday number 1 on the bottom 100?	1
Lung exploding comedy! no joke, watch this movie.	Rehovot, Israel	Ill start by stating that if that movie claimed it was a comedy, i would have rated it a solid 6.This movie caught us by complete surprise. A bunch of friends came by my place to hang out, we got high and and a genius idea popped into my head. &#x22;Let&#x27;s watch a god awful movie&#x22; i said. I goggled &#x22;imdb bottom rated movies&#x22; and rest will be forever remembered as the day that a 1.8/10 IMDb movie made us soil our pants laughing.We literally laughed the entire movie. Every thing in this movie is of kindergarten quality, CGI reminds me of Microsoft Powerpoint presentations i use to make in my grade school days. The audio is sickening and half of the movie you cant hear jack squat because a boom Mic was out of the budget apparently. Everything was just eye-gouging, suicide inducing awful.WE LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT, in fact we watched the second movie immediately after the first one, and it was just as hilarious.Please watch this movie. get as high as possible if you can...thank me later.	1
The reason IMDb needs a 0/10 score	None	I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of &#x22;worst of all time&#x22; movies lately, and most have been so bad that they&#x27;re good. This movie is so bad that it&#x27;s insulting to all the other terrible movies. There is no accurate way to quantify the awfulness of this movie. I&#x27;m certain the director has never seen another movie, I&#x27;ve seen amateur highschool movies that put this to absolute SHAME. To begin, the first half of the movie is the most awkward, poorly written, terribly acted romance of all time. Half the scenes include characters driving, parking, getting in and out of the car. The audio is so bad that the quality changes in the middle of scenes; outdoor scenes at the beach are inaudible because there is absolutely no editing of the audio. The entire plot is pointless, with the first bird attack happening halfway through the movie. The effects....wow. There is one terrible scene with birds attacking in the absolute worst imaginable animation of all time, clip art from Microsoft Office essentially. They couldn&#x27;t even get a stuffed bird to serve as a dead bird, they use clipart instead. There are 3 animations for the birds throughout the entire film, the first 2 which are reused over 10 times. I can&#x27;t actually....I can&#x27;t finish the review. This movie is an abomination...it&#x27;s an insult to everyone that watches it, it&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s not even worth watching for the laughs. James Nyugen is a terrible person for making this, and if there is a hell, he&#x27;ll be walking into the fire before Hitler or Stalin.	1
A movie so terrible is fascinating	United Kingdom	I don&#x27;t know where to begin this review. It is a film that completely fails at every step of the movie making process. From directing, to acting, to writing, to camera operation, to scene structure, to pacing, to visual effects, to sound editing... The list goes on. I watched birdemic thinking it was a &#x27;deliberately bad so it&#x27;s funny&#x27; kinda movie. It&#x27;s not. You can see the films director James Nguyan takes himself completely seriously with the global warming message jammed down our throats. I spent the majority of the hour and thirty minute run time laughing in disbelief that this movie exists. It is a film you have to watch, if only to know how to gauge a bad movie in the future. I was just wondering what fundamental error they were going to make next. Overall birdemic is a fascinating piece of work simply because it is truly awful cinema. So terrible that it&#x27;s unintentionally hilarious. I would absolutely classify it as a must watch.	1
Very poorly made movie, yet at times humorous.	United States	Make no mistake, this movie is painfully bad. It has a horrible camera, very bad acting, not so special effects, abysmal sound, etc. But if you&#x27;re able to endure the movie, I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ll have a few laughs at the movie&#x27;s expense (like the clapping scene). I did, which is why I&#x27;m giving it three stars instead of one. I don&#x27;t regret watching the movie, but I don&#x27;t see myself wanting to watch it again.The birds are the same two poorly animated models (an eagle and a sea gull), they flap around making the same annoying sound, the guns are obviously air soft guns, the birds only have about 2-3 dying animations. The dialogue is painfully bad. I question whether it was done and shot purposely like that in an attempt to be humorous.There also may be an underlining message that global warming may be a serious concern to our planet, but the movie was too stupid for me to actually care.	3
Birdemic is a gem in so bad its good cinema	San Antonio	Birdemic: Shock and Terror is a horrible movie. Everything that can be construed as competent filmmaking can&#x27;t be found here. Horrible acting, horrible dialog, horrible plot, horrible effects, and horrible everything else. However, if you love bad movies that bring the laughs, then this is a treat.Good: There&#x27;s nothing good here. Everything is done so badly. However, if you love bad movies, then it&#x27;s a masterpiece. Beyond wooden acting and dialog along with a dumb preachy plot and just stupidity from all fronts make this the perfect movie to make jokes with your friends and some beers.Bad: Going by movie standards, it fails. The actors here are all beyond bad, their delivery is so painful, the effects are horrible, the plot is both preachy and idiotic, there&#x27;s no smooth transitions with some of the worst editing I&#x27;ve ever seen, logic is thrown out the window in every scene, and it makes you wonder how anyone involved would look at this as even OK.Overall, it&#x27;s a terrible movie. It is still one of the funniest train wrecks that Ed Wood would be proud of. If you love bad cinema, watch this now. Everyone else, just leave.	1
I am disturbed that this could even be considered a movie!	United States	Let&#x27;s kick off the review by getting one thing clear...This is one of the most absolute and downright awful films I have ever seen in my entire life. There was nothing good about this film except the sigh of relief when the credits roll in the end. Honestly please do not watch this film expecting anything, or you know better yet do not see this film at all. Now if you do decide to see this movie make sure you have something such as alcohol and friends because let me assure you of something..You are going to need it!Now to talk about the film you need to know that the actors are unbearably bad as well as the so-called script they&#x27;re reading. The editing/special effect were done in such a way that it made the movie feel even worse due to it&#x27;s lack of artistic direction or for better words any direction at all. The clarity of both the audio and video were absolutely awful because 1: It sounds as it&#x27;s done with no microphones of any kind throughout. 2: The Video clarity is so bad you have to wash your own glasses to make sure that isn&#x27;t the issue. Another issue is the extremely clich&#xE9; so-called scenes of Fights, Love, and Drama made this movie even more of a laugh for me.This movie was so poorly done that I will never watch it again even if it&#x27;s with some friends for comedic purposes. I was surprised that I was even able to finish this movie. If you decide to watch this be prepared for itFinal Rating 0.5/10	1
Not so bad its good... Just so bad its funny.	Newcastle, Australia	Where to start... Birdemic. There. A start. People can describe many movies with a sentence. Unless you come to describe Birdemic. Sure, you may say &#x22;It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s funny&#x22;, but to describe the content in one sentence leaves you with &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22;. The shock is there (the birds... which are GIF&#x27;s stuck in a place on the screen, moving with the camera), but the only terror is... uh...Aprroximatley 90 minutes, the first 45 involve nothing. Unless you call a creepy salesman getting a girls&#x27; phone number, same salesman making a sale, announcing it to his job, having other employees applaud him for 95 seconds (even thought he made them lose a couple of a million dollars, but who cares when you sell something) and bad sound quality something. If you are more like me, however, you should watch this part anyways.And then the badly animated birds appear and attack, because of global warming or something like that. They kill people, you know, nothing exiting, really. And wow, those kids must hate their mother.And the ending. I thought when reading reviews, &#x22;I can&#x27;t be THAT bad.&#x22; Then I accepted the truth. The ending was terrible.But, ending on a positive note, this movie is unintentionally funny. Hilarious. The lines of poorly written dialog make the movie bearable. I would give this 8 out of 10 if it was intentionally bad and funny, but since, it is not, I give a two. It doesn&#x27;t deserve a good rating, but the outcome makes it more than a one.	2
Vietnamese Uwe Boll, lower on cash but higher on stupid/insane	Zagreb, Croatia	This is one of the rare &#x22;Hey, I just got a camera, let&#x27;s film something&#x22; abominations that I enjoyed..but I use term enjoyment loosely as this thing is, what I call, an endurance testing vehicle.It doesn&#x27;t quite have the charm of The Room (another home made keeper), but it excels in all of the other trashy movie checklist dogma(s)..absolutely no plot, absolutely no acting, absolutely no special effects, absolutely no directing/editing/sound, absolutely NOTHING. And that is what keeps this boat from sinking brutally as I have yet to find such an inept attempt at recording something. Anything.It was interspersed with boring bits and some headache inducing moments. They were worthy adversary but if you can manage to go through them you will be rewarded as I was.As a lot of reviewers mentioned, lead character is the funniest. Even the most mundane actions such as walking and talking seem strange to him as he tries to mimic these actions.All in all, a must see film, either for laughing at it or watching it in disbelief.Belongs in Top 5 Bottom barrel (for now).	10
One of the Worst Movies Ever Created	United States	Rated: 1/10 Rounded to 1I can&#x27;t even express how bad this film is. The only reason one would watch this is to make fun of pretty much every aspect of the film. It is so terrible it&#x27;s almost funny. The animation is terrible, the birds literally float in mid air while barely flapping their wings. The acting is almost as bad as the animation, we won&#x27;t even talk about it. And the first 50 min. of the film has absolutely no point and doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with the rest of the film. I&#x27;ve made better films with 3 kid actors, Nerf guns, and a $30 video camera in my back yard... and I have proof. To sum it up, do not watch this movie... it&#x27;s the kind of movie someone would use to torture a prisoner.Was this review helpful? If so, check out my other reviews.

Drunky Dwarf reviews : Birdemic: Shock and Terror ( 2010).	Belgium	Waw, just wow. U know that feeling when you&#x27;re having a conversation and then the conversation stops because you don&#x27;t know anything more to talk about? That is pretty much the dialog for this movie. U can&#x27;t call it dialog either, it&#x27;s like 45 minutes of dead silence. This movie is so uncomfortable, it&#x27;s more comfortable to watch your grandmother making out with a giant pink furry unicorn with a Justin Bieber face then watching this movie.The problem with the acting is that it feels so unnatural. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re watching a bunch of robots who are programmed to walk to this place, then do that. They don&#x27;t give any motivations for their actions. If u would replace the main actor with a tree, i wouldn&#x27;t notice it. My guess that they are taken from the p-business ( IMDb is forcing me to censor this word) .That would explain why the bed scene is the best scene in the entire movie.Let&#x27;s talk about the plot: there is a guy and he earns a million dollars or something. He meets a random blond girl in a caf&#xE9; and he seduces-es her with a creepy smile. So they drive around and they visit her mother, they go to work and visit an Irish pub! Then suddenly........ a random singer sings for them. The bland guy dances the same for 5 minutes. Oh yeah there is something with birds too in the last part. And speeches about global warming , long LONG speeches from the most random people ( a tree-hugger?) The plot and the characters are so stupid. Everybody who worked at this movie should be ashamed. The plot makes no sense and the writers , sorry the writer, who is also the director, probably also the editor, producer, sound editor and donut boy, was permanently high. The most random thing about the movie is that when the birds start attacking the main characters, they just go in a random house to see other random people. Then they start riding with their magic car. A car that randomly spawns stuff that they need. &#x22;Oh look, it&#x27;s a machine gun!&#x22; &#x22; It&#x27;s a fishing rod!&#x22; &#x22; And there, a AK47&#x22; &#x22; Oh hey, Godzilla eggs here!&#x22; &#x22; OMG , a nuke&#x22; OK maybe those last ones weren&#x27;t true but if they indeed would happen i wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.Let&#x27;s talk about the biggest problem of the movie. U don&#x27;t care about the story and neither do the characters and the writer. For example: children just had their parents killed, they don&#x27;t care, they just want a happy meal? Somebody just died, OK they are sad for like three seconds and then it&#x27;s OK again. They don&#x27;t even censor the other cars. It&#x27;s not an apocalypse when you see everybody driving around. ( maybe the birds learned to drive?) The filmmaker obviously didn&#x27;t care to make a good movie so why should we care ?This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. Everything about it is bad. The ending is terrible; it is all so bad. If i ever watch this movie again i will puke out birds everywhere. The movie&#x27;s biggest enemy is not the birds but the director itself ( and the hungry kids).( Btw : in case u don&#x27;t know, the special effects are really bad).	1
The Must See Worst Film!!!	United States	I have seen The Room. Birdemic makes The Room seem like a much better movie. A lot of things don&#x27;t make sense.The movie starts out with the main character driving along which looks like Malibu Canyon Rd near Los Angeles. Then all of sudden he is suppose to be in Northern California. I guess we are not suppose to notice this movie doesn&#x27;t make sense. Why did they choose Eagles and Vultures as the birds that would attack people? I guess they are the biggest and most scariest birds they could find.I think Tommy Wiseau was at least attempting to make at least a decent movie with The Room. I gave this movie 5 out 10 of just because of how crazy this movie is. I really liked the bad CGI in this movie. It&#x27;s funny seeing those birds just Floating in Air. It&#x27;s like they levitating or something.	5
Oh my	United Kingdom	Almost impossible review as a commercial movies, &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; looks like a home-made project that somehow got a release. Everything about it screams UNPROFESSIONAL!!! From the very basic opening credits, which are in a hideous PC-average font, to the very long and static shots that start too early (before the actors are ready) and go on too long (after the action or conversations have ended), which show no understanding of cutting or editing. From the terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle, revealing that there microphone was on the camera and sometimes the background noise drowns out the dialogue, to the script and acting which makes you want to throw things (the lead guy walks like a drugged 5 year old, which is a shame as there are many long minutes of footage devoted to showing him just walking).And then we have to bird effects which look like a screen saver or a phone app. Stuck just on top of the filmed action we see looped animations of birds which can seemingly hover in one place flapping in slow motion.The appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating, meeting the parents, visiting restaurants and driving cars before anything happens. Once the bird attacks start, our gang of 4-6 &#x22;survivors&#x22; (apart from all the people strolling about that are not part of the film, and the endless traffic of other cars and trucks that are also not part of the film) seem to make a mad dash from the city (why is not explained) into the countryside (why that&#x27;s safer is not explained), stopping regularly to buy gigantic bottles of water, armfuls of food and tanks full of petrol, only to somehow have to drink from streams and eat seaweed and a fish caught from the ocean only minutes later, when they can&#x27;t be more than a few minutes stroll from another convenience store.You need nerves of steel to be able to sit through this and call it entertainment. I can only assume this is a home movie. If it is, it must have been fun for the actors and their friends to watch once it was finished, but how actually got to be distributed and sold commercially is a total mystery.	2
Pass the Popcorn review	Osijek, Croatia	In 1963 Alfred Hitchcock made his cult movie &#x27;The Birds in 2010 James Nguyen took the concept to a whole new level. Birdemic is currently the sixth worst movie on the IMDb &#x22;Bottom 100 movies&#x22; list, which is still pretty low. It might just be the worst, most boring movie about killer birds and ecology ever made.Rod (Alan Bagh) is a successful software salesman who has just started dating Nathalie (Whitney Moore), a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model. As it usually happens in movies, their perfect lives are suddenly threatened by, in this case, killer birds that, interestingly, start attacking them after they&#x27;ve spent their first night together.This movie is so bad it isn&#x27;t even funny. It begins with endless scenes of Rod driving around town and moves onto horribly edited phone call scenes. If you skip the first hour, you&#x27;re guaranteed not to miss anything except a really bad and boring introduction to the story. I can&#x27;t understand why was Alan Bagh chosen to play the lead since he is clearly the worst actor of all and even a tree could have done a better job than he did. Whitney Moore, on the other hand, seems to be constantly embarrassed and therefore can&#x27;t stop smiling.The occasionally awkward dialogue is also worth mentioning: the scene in which Rod says that Becky &#x22;is taking a s**t. Nathalie is watching her back.&#x22; is certainly going to be remembered as a screen writing masterpiece. But the Oscar goes to Yeung Chang&#x27;s visual effects, if you dare call them that. He would have done a better job using Microsoft Paint.The music is awful, too. But it&#x27;s not as relevant as the message of this movie: Nguyen saw &#x27;An inconvenient truth&#x27; and thought it would be a good idea to make global warming the cause of the birds&#x27; madness, turning this movie into a bad horror with elements of ecological propaganda that nobody cares about. It actually makes you want to go and burn down a forest, just to make Nguyen sad. Which leads us to the obvious conclusion that everything in this movie is awful.Rating: 1/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/	1
Ever heard of so bad its funny? This takes the concept to a new level.	None	When I started watching this movie I thought of making some kind of intelligent commentary, but just a few minutes into the film, I gave up on that thought, and just tried to lean back, relax and enjoy the spectacle that is Birdemic.This film is absolutely awesome, awesomely bad but also awesomely funny. The acting is absolutely atrocious and there are long pauses in the dialog that make it even worse, but, it&#x27;s on such a level that bad translates to funny. Same thing with the CGI birds; they are exceptionally poorly done, there are high school students that can do better animations. It is absolutely hilarious to see these badly animated birds flap around. The story however is pretty boring, a large part of the movie is dedicated to this &#x22;slice of life&#x22; kind of stuff that I guess is supposed to establish the characters and the setting but it is thoroughly uninteresting. The only good part about it is how they squeeze in some kind of semi coherent environmental message about global warming, which they later bring up as the cause for the birds attacking.This is some quality bad movie material right here, I am just too aware of how horrendously bad it is that I can not score it higher than 3.	3
Laughable.	United States	This film is laughable. No, actually. Like if you want a good laugh with some friends, watch this movie.A group of my buddies and I were in stitches the entire time.Aside from the humorous aspect of this disaster, I&#x27;m afraid there is little-to-no-value in watching this. Birdemic suffers from terrible acting, poor video quality, an annoying soundtrack, lackluster special effects, forgettable characters, and a preachy ending. Not to mention the completely unnecessary amount of gore and sexual themes. I couldn&#x27;t tell if the alleged &#x22;environmentalist&#x22; message in this film was part of a conspiracy theory or just a joke...It&#x27;s difficult to find something I actually liked about the film. So I&#x27;m just going to end the review here.Just make sure to add Birdemic to your &#x22;terrible movie night&#x22; movie list and, when you do get to watching it, prepare to shake your head in disbelief at least a few times.	2
Um...I dont even know where to begin	United States	This is the worst movie ever made. I was not upset after I finished it because I didn&#x27;t feel it was a film maker doing an injustice to Film as a whole, I just felt it was an idiot using his parents old video camera and calling himself a director. The 1st problem I have with this....um...&#x22;thing&#x22; is that whoever was involved in this process couldn&#x27;t speak up and say &#x22;Um, Mr. Nguyen, what the fu*$ are we doing?&#x22; The 2nd problem is whenever someone tries to send a political message in a film, either you better know what you are talking about or at least do it somewhat well, because if you do it as shitty as this nutcase, you will look like a complete idiot and disgrace all your hippy friends...dear God! Sorry, even thinking about it hurts my brain.I will leave you with this. Watch the trailer, enough said. If you want a good laugh, watch &#x22;The Mary Tyler Moore Show,&#x22; don&#x27;t support this, it&#x27;s not film making...it&#x27;s Birdemic...Lord even the title makes me want to blow my brains out	1
This really could be the worst movie ever made.	United States	Shock and Terror? You better believe it. You will be shocked and terrified by how bad this movie is. I have seen a lot of bad movies but I can&#x27;t think of a single one that comes close to being as bad as Birdemic: Shock and Terror.The writer/director is totally inept and made the following mistakes: Included many long boring scenes of the characters driving very slowly, writing dialogue that is both boring and strange at the same time, and casting a space alien to play the main character.The &#x22;actor&#x22; who plays the hero of the piece, Rod, is devoid of personality, flubs lines, can&#x27;t enunciate, and can&#x27;t even walk like a normal human.Now for the story. For the first 45 minutes or so the movie seems to be a really lame advertisement for solar panels (or solapans as the main characters says it). The first half seems like a romantic comedy minus the comedy. There is no sign of the Birdemic until almost an hour into the movie. From then on the movie shifts gears and becomes a propaganda piece. It appears that global warming has not only caused the birdemic, but also deforestation via bark beetles. We learn this from a weirdo standing on a bridge and an even weirder guy who wears a bad wig and lives in a tree house. This is where the terror comes in.I give this tripe the lowest rating I can, 1 star out of 10. Either watch the rifftrax version or skip it entirely.	1
Truly the worst movie ever	United States	Remember those old 60&#x27;s sitcoms with the scary rubber bats on wires? The special effects in this one are worse. Even though they are CGI (circa 1993), the superimposed birds look more like paper cutouts than anything else. The main gal actually pulls off her role with some charm. The guy, not so much.This movie is so cheep (sorry) that they didn&#x27;t even bother to pay for using stock footage. Look for the &#x22;Getty Images&#x22; watermark on the racing footage during the newscast. And I don&#x27;t believe the director ever learned the word &#x22;Cut!&#x22;. This one far outshines what I had previously considered to be the best worst movie(s) I&#x27;d ever seen.	1
Shock and awe	United Kingdom	Birds that crash making plane sounds. Genius.I was also quite impressed with Rod as the gentleman seductive player. He has taught me a lot about how to deal with people i&#x27;m attracted to. The boardroom scene will be forever remembered. Next time i&#x27;m at work, I will make sure the clapping tempo has the exact variations.My brain is forever imprinted with this film, and as a film student I will try to live up to my new idol, James Nguyen.Natalie&#x27;s depiction as a victoria secret model puts Adriana Lima to shame. Hopefully they realize the mistakes they have been making with their model selection.	1
A completely awful piece of entertainment	New Jersey	WHY WHY WHY WHY?? Awful sound. Acting that makes Manos look like Citizen Kane. A story with more plot holes than The Room, in a bad way unlike in The Room when it was funny as all hell. Remaking a Hitchcock film has always failed in more ways than one. The plot is like if you watch An Inconvenient Truth while drinking as much you can while watching The Birds. They force this stupid moral of the save the environment in to your head that you just wanna mash your television. The sound makes an Atari 2600 game sound like HD surround sound for Crysis 2. You can barely hear what people are saying mainly because of background some effects. Music as well is pure crap, it&#x27;s all free down loadable music from the internet. Only watch this for RiffTrax. STAY AWAY FROM IT!	1
wow.........wtf is this crap???	United States	I created an account just so I could put a review out on this horrible film. In fact, my wife just finished watching all 3 minutes she was able to bear &#x26; seems to have gone into a coma. I&#x27;m going down to best buy right now to give this movie back. I have no idea what makes this person think he has the ability to make a movie. Do yourself a favor &#x26; go back to your job at mcdonalds &#x26; just give all your movie making equipment away. The acting was horrible, the &#x22;special&#x22; effects were...special. It was as though a chimp got on a computer, dropped some acid &#x26; said, &#x22;hey lets make a movie&#x22;. &#x26; then someone put it in a box &#x26; convinced a few of us to buy it. Money well spent if buying a movie you can&#x27;t finish watching is your thing. Wow...thats all I can say...	1
Not even entertainingly bad.	United States	Let me start by saying that I get the whole &#x27;It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s good thing.&#x22; I am a huge fan of The Room in fact. But this film, if you don&#x27;t mind embarrassing all other films by calling it that has absolutely no entertainment value. The acting is god-awful, it&#x27;s not funny either, it&#x27;s just horrible. The dialog makes no sense and doesn&#x27;t move the story forward at all. This is also the most slow-paced movie ever. Every scene is painstakingly dragged out. After watching for ten minutes it will seem like thirty. At the same time it feels like you&#x27;ve only been watching for one minute because absolutely nothing has happened. Not until half way through the movie does any action start. And when it does, you&#x27;ll wish it hadn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s horrible and indescribable. Before you decide to watch this movie try to watch a clip on youtube or something just so you know what you&#x27;re getting into. One last thing; the propaganda. This whole movie is some stupid preachy attempt to make people go green. A noble cause. But the stupidity of this movie made me resent the idea just because of how awfully it is portrayed. Long story short; DO NOT WATCH. Huge waste of time.	1
Ive seen better quality toilet seats, dripping in urine compared to this film.	England	Hmm, well this is an interesting film to review, I usually have a lot of fun reviewing films, which aren&#x27;t exactly at the top of the pile; this is way below anything I have watched before.So let&#x27;s start off and build our way up to how bad this film truly is; I&#x27;ve seen homemade porn not as bad as this is.1. Camera Work: Now, this is quite minimal in terms of how shoddy the rest of the film is, this is about as good as it gets. But even the camera work is flawed, sometimes the camera even misses the shot of the car it&#x27;s meant to be shooting; even got some suspicious looking wonky shots too (this could be due to the scenery, but I honestly swear and to be honest it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me; that some of the camera shots were not level). Overall the camera work was definitely filmed by an amateur or worse, it&#x27;s like watching a homemade movie filmed by your druggie uncle; who makes a living recording his seedy homemade sex videos and sells them on for heroine; but that&#x27;s another story.2. Editing: This slowly creeps its way up the ladder in terms of severity, camera work of course being the least worse, in this melting pot of &#x27;shock and terror&#x27;, ha, see what I did there? Anyway, the editing is very bad indeed. It&#x27;s like watching a film made by a 15 year old, pizza faced teenager at secondary school (high school for you flash Americans). One scene which shows this the most is with the celebrating-in-the-office-board-meeting thing, it&#x27;s quite vague; but I can&#x27;t for the life of me actually remember what that scene was about; apart from a lot of clapping and applauding (literally a lot of clapping and applauding, with lots of dodgy cuts in between). Overall, not good, I mean I can do better with my video editing skills. I may sound really big headed, but I KNOW I can, and film it better.3. Sound: This is very bad, in the first opening line spoken by two of the actors in the caf&#xE9;, the audio straight away clips and breaks. I mean, I would give this film some credit and possibly 3 stars if everything else was but the sound was okay, but that&#x27;s not going to happen, I can bet my left nut on it.4. Acting/Directing/Writing: Decided to include this together, as to be able to make five points, instead of seven. The acting is very wooden, all the actors used are unknown or new talent picked up from the street; where they got them from I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s as if the Director just popped down the supermarket and thought, &#x22;she&#x27;s got a nice pair of breasts, let&#x27;s use her!&#x22; not that he did that with his male casting too. The overall writing from what I can tell is very basic, most of the dialog is basically one line sentences; with very limited plot development among the characters. This film just basically says, &#x22;look birds!&#x22; and, &#x22;oh quick, got to shoot the birds and run away!&#x22; Don&#x27;t even get me started on the directing...5. Special Effects (lack of): Finally, the best of the best! Well worst of the low in this scenario. The special effects look as though they have been made by a child with a hard on for GIF animation. The birds in this film are ridiculous, when I first saw the film trailer, I originally thought it was someone&#x27;s film project from college which was being linked to me; was only until I checked here at IMDb that I got the full picture. It&#x27;s full of over the top muzzle flashes too, when I say over the top; I should probably say very little. I mean okay, the special effects look fake anyway, but the muzzle flashes are too small for a start anyway; don&#x27;t add insult to injury James!Jesus Christ, I mean I have never had so much to say for one film in my entire life, this doesn&#x27;t even get anywhere near the infamous Silent Night Deadly Night 2, in terms of production value and acting. This film beats every bad film I know of out there. But let&#x27;s not get too hasty shall we, for example this film has it&#x27;s uses, I watched this film knowing it was going to bad; I almost died from laughing too much at the film. This is a film to watch with a group of friends, some pizza and preferably some alcohol; maybe even some hard class a drugs if you&#x27;re feeling rebellious!So yeah, watch it, but be warned, this is terrible, it&#x27;s quite boring too. After the sensation of laughing at how bad the film is, you tend to find your hand reaching for the fast forward button.But yeah, well done James, you made an amazing film. (Please don&#x27;t quote this in your next film trailer).	1
what a pathetic excuse for a film	New Zealand	If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I was watching this dumpsterpiece movie with four friends, I would be bashing my head against something hard, and questioning the very usefulness of my life. In other words, yes, this movie was THAT bad. I&#x27;ve heard that Birdemic was supposed to be a very bad, very cheap rip off of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds, but Lord almighty! Fifteen minutes into it I was starting to panic.Rod (Alan Bagh), is a Silicon Valley software designer yuppie who has just made it big. Not to mention he always walks like he wears a back brace. He&#x27;s about to land a deal that will make him a millionaire, because this movie certainly won&#x27;t do that. Also, he drives my dream car (a Ford Mustang), and always drives about 20 mph below the speed limit. Have some respect, dude. But anyway, Rod goes into a diner and meets Natalie (Whitney Moore) by first asking &#x22;didn&#x27;t you go to high school with me?&#x22; Natalie is also a very hot blonde aspiring model, who just happens to give her phone number to a guy like Rod, whom she barely knows. That&#x27;s basically the first half of the movie, a romance blossoming. On top of that, there are stories about the ice caps melting, and swarms of eagles dying. Uh oh, does this mean Al Gore was right? One night, Rod and Natalie go to a cheap motel to have loving, but emotionless sex. All of a sudden, swarms of eagles are going around, swarming people, killing people, and blowing up houses by ramming into them like kamikaze pilots. Now, it&#x27;s up to this young couple to try to find survivors, and kill birds. Soon along the way, we meet Dr. Jones (Rick Camp), who tells us that we screwed up this planet, created global warming, and now birds are killing everybody.So .where to begin with this movie? First off, it has probably the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie that&#x27;s not a porno. I would say the acting was as wooden as Pinocchio, but Pinocchio actually DOES become a real boy at the end. There was no hope for this movie at all. I saw this being sold on blu ray for $25. I don&#x27;t even think this movie cost 25 cents to make! Just watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean. Everything about this movie sucked. The script was so badly written, it was almost a tragicomedy. At least Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds had robotic birds. Okay, the CGI buzzards that were attacking people, I think the editing machines in a public access TV studio are more sophisticated. Plus, there were a lot of underlying themes about global warming here. If these environmentalist screenwriters wanted to convince me to stop contributing to greenhouse gasses, they&#x27;re going to have to do better that Birdemic. I seriously hope the filmmakers weren&#x27;t taking this too seriously, because it&#x27;s such a joke.I love B rate movies, and I like playing &#x22;Mystery Science Theater 3000&#x2033; with them. But this movie made Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. Some of these lines are so awful: &#x22;Humans need to stop playing cowboys with nature.&#x22; When people were attacked by birds, they were more or less being attack by a Windows 3.1 screensaver. I would have made a better movie when I was in middle school. What else do I have to say? Just go online and watch the trailer, that will visualize everything. I&#x27;m all for cheap filmmaking, but this is just pushing it.I leave you with this thought. I mentioned earlier that I was watching this colostomy bag of a movie with four friends, where we made sarcastic remarks. My thought is maybe this is why bad movies are made, why Birdemic was made&#x96;to bring in more social gatherings.	1
Move over, Ed Wood. No seriously, get off the papier-mch throne	The Divided States of Earth	It&#x27;s unbelievable that APPARENTLY &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; is unintentionally so inept. After seeing the movie I was borderline convinced that it&#x27;s a product of ingenious comedy filmmakers but the DVD special features taught me better. One way or the other auteur Nguyen must be consumed with Hollywood movies or rather with all of their clich&#xE9;s. Basically what the film does brilliantly throughout is to use movie clich&#xE9;s so obviously and so poorly that it exposes those clich&#xE9;s. You inevitably realize how the filmmakers are trying to manipulate the viewer rendering its manipulatory attempts ineffective but not without reminding you that it does nothing else than what most action-y big budget movies do and you think to yourself: &#x22;Even if done well, how could I ever fall for such stupidity in other movies?&#x22; It exposes the fabric of movie-making itself and therefore if you watch &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; attentively you will never see an overly manipulative or clich&#xE9;-ridden movie the same way again.There&#x27;s the story arc of establishing the hero with a romance before it turns into the movie we actually want to see. This one does it as jarringly as possible, the first 50 minutes are literally a romance almost without any forbidding of impending doom. OK, there&#x27;s the title sequence music that blobs about repetitively like Torgo&#x27;s theme in &#x27;&#x27;Manos&#x27; The Hands of Fate&#x27; wishing it was Bernard Hermann&#x27;s &#x27;Psycho&#x27; theme that was used so effectively 50 years ago with Janet Leigh behind the wheel. And there&#x27;s the couple watching parrots fly about a tree and finding a dead eagle on the beach...unnecessarily all done in CGI, by the way, just as is common practice in modern cinema, practical effects just aren&#x27;t accepted by modern movie going audiences anymore, it must be CGI no matter how bad it looks, it&#x27;s called suspension of disbelief (while practical effects are just rubbish, period). So there you have it folks. Anyway, so at the 50-minute mark the movie suddenly shriekingly turns into a disaster movie from one second to the next (not counting the one minute &#x22;establishing shot montage&#x22; preceding it).Want more stereotype and clich&#xE9; debunking? Don&#x27;t worry, &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; delivers them relentlessly. The heroic protagonist who gets the bombshell and has not only one big career success in the movie but about three - in, like, two days - is a stoic, stupid black hole of charisma, the stereotypical &#x22;a guy like you and me&#x22; who succeeds anyway. The female lead likes everything he does and she&#x27;s won over by the guy despite his &#xFC;ber-dorkyness, personalitylessness and stalker-like behavior but not without lighting up the screen in every frame of the film with her amazing smile as if she was walking a red carpet, yeah, even during the bird attacks. Of course she also strikes a big career success when she gets a cover model for Victoria Secret gig, you know, &#x22;just a regular fashion model like you and me&#x22;.Characters who are unlikely to have ever used a gun in their lives (a software salesman and a fashion model?) pull guns out of their &#x22;asses&#x22; and shoot them like pros without fear or remorse. Characters that are only relevant for one scene (if even that) are literally out of the picture when they aren&#x27;t needed (hey, they are just in the car&#x27;s back seat and REALLY quiet, that&#x27;s all) and are back once they have to be. Between bird attacks the characters are as careless as can be. So careless that they take a break from escaping the attacking birds by having a picnic outdoors with their kidnapped children who just lost their parents and whose only purpose in the film (apart from getting &#x22;rescued&#x22; by our the-second-coming-of-Siegfried protagonist) is to bitch that they are hungry and that instead of fresh fish they want a Happy Meal&#xAE;.There&#x27;s a theme that runs through the whole film as is typical for even the most shallow disaster movie but this one really rubs it into the viewer&#x27;s face. At times (well, for most of its running time, actually) it plays like an ad for solar power or a raising awareness ad for global warming. The main character is shown how he is &#x22;going green&#x22; during the course of the movie without bearing any relevance to the story, and not only figuratively but literally as well, the guy&#x27;s and the girl&#x27;s wardrobe gets increasingly greener starting subtly with a light green tie until by the end their clothes are all green. Clearly Nguyen learned about subtext from the greatest of filmmakers.But seriously, &#x27;Birdemic&#x27; had me from minute one with production logos and credits being displayed without any sense of rhythm. During the opening credits (which for example credit a &#x22;Patsy vanEttinger&#x22;, yes, without a space between van and the last name) we watch a Mustang driving on a country road at a snail&#x27;s pace. In one scene a small tow truck with a load is stuck behind the Mustang, that&#x27;s how slow he goes. And he continues to drive this slow throughout the entire film. Did I mention that sometimes the camera operator still is unable to keep the Mustang inside the frame when panning? Now THAT is comedy. 30 minutes in the guy mentions that his Mustang is a hybrid car. Ha, that explains everything. Subtly making the thing that the movie is a commercial for look bad. Nice gag. One among thousands since every other edit in the film is a joke. If you can laugh about horribly poor editing this is the movie for you. Really, it&#x27;s quite astonishing that a digitally shot movie could have a glaring error like cutting to characters who are supposed to be in the middle of an action but are actually seen at the beginning of the shot for the director to yell action so they can start running.	8
A Truly Awful Film!!!	United States	This movie is so dumb and stupid, that it&#x27;s laughable. After watching it a 2nd time with friends, it&#x27;s a little better, but that&#x27;s not saying much. The lead actor is always talking about his lame job, the sound is choppy, the birds are incredibly fake looking, the actors are terrible, and they talk about global warming every 10 minutes. Rod is a software salesman who runs into a fashion model named Natalie. They show their melodramatic love story until finally the birdemic starts. (It takes 47 minutes for the birds to start attacking) When they attack, that&#x27;s when the fun of this movie begins. When they shoot at the birds, it&#x27;s like the old Nintendo game, Duck Hunt. Rod and Natalie meet up with survivors and help two kids who lost their parents, but don&#x27;t seem to care enough. Will they survive? This movie is worth a watch. It&#x27;s so bad, it has to be seen to be believed. I would recommend BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR!!!	2
Ive seen better special effects from the 1940s.	New Zealand	This movie actually made me feel like a terrible person.I&#x27;m not even joking. This sh*t was even worse than &#x27;The Exorcism of Emily Rose&#x27; which is saying something.The acting was worse than anything I have seen before, the audio cut out randomly, and the &#x22;Special Effects&#x22; GOD DAMN, THOSE &#x22;Effects&#x22; WERE TERRIBLE.I regret watching this crap, I want my life back. And guess what? There&#x27;s a sequel. And the tag-line? &#x22;You asked for it&#x22;No. We did NOT ask for it. We asked for it to be purged from the world, and all copies immediately seized. NOT for another, equally terrible sequel.Oh, did I also mention that the plot MAKES NO SENSE WHATSOEVER?	1
A Masterpiece	United Kingdom	This film sucks a giant donkey&#x27;s wiener; nothing makes sense with meaningless characters, god awful special effects, and don&#x27;t get me started on the acting - BUT - I love this film simply because I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing, and laughing, and laughing, and laughing.If laughter is the best medicine, this&#x27;ll heal cancer.The plot is something to do with birds or something, I don&#x27;t really care what the plot is because when I first saw those birds dive bombing into buildings I fell off the sofa and on to the, harder than I thought, wooden floor.You may start watching this film and almost immediately give up from the long driving scene and windows movie maker opening credits, but you got to stay strong because before you know it a girl gets killed by a bird while peeing on the side of the road.In conclusion - A masterpiece of cinema.	10
One Of The Worst Movies Ever Made	Canada	We rented this movie today (April 9, 2011) thinking that it would be a good movie; we were both surprised at how bad it is. The sound comes and goes from time to time, the picture quality is good, not much for horror scenes, and the birds when they attack looks so fake; like a video game.We have seen our share of bad movies but, this one takes the cake; I would not recommend this movie at all unless the person is that bored and willing to watch this kind of cheesy class b movie.I have noticed that there is supposed to be a part 2 to this movie; I don&#x27;t think I will be renting it, it&#x27;s supposed to be in 3D too but, if it&#x27;s as bad as this one; forget it, I won&#x27;t waste my money or time.This is more of a made for TV movie, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for TV either; I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they did this movie.	1
Not A Review	London, England	By now you&#x27;ve probably all read enough about how poorly crafted Birdemic is on every level.Sure, it&#x27;s bad. Bad bad bad even.Perhaps a little too bad?Is there a human being in the world that couldn&#x27;t turn in a better performance than the leading man?Wouldn&#x27;t wranglers with bird puppets be more believable?This is just an observation, but it doesn&#x27;t appear that anyone from this cast or crew has taken their lives or died under mysterious circumstances shortly after Birdemic&#x27;s release. Isn&#x27;t that standard fare for the worst movies of all time? Another reason to believe this was a calculated cult classic.	2
Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	United Kingdom	Why do I want to write the 5th comment on Birdemic? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that affects me as strongly is Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn&#x27;t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like Bird-attack movies and I don&#x27;t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking Birdemic out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, &#x22;Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.&#x22; At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.The allusions to real-life are both subtle and prophetic. Non-stop action combines with stunning special effects to portray the inherent struggle that humans face against killer eagles and vultures around the world on a daily basis; this film might just be the inspiration needed for governments to tackle this global problem.Birdemic and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it&#x27;s technical merits - I don&#x27;t really care about that. I have read that the Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Birdemic to touch the soul.	10
Junk	Hungary	Nguyen instantly re-establishes his signature style with a long opening credits sequence in which simply capturing a protagonist walking down a street &#x97; in this case, Hollywood Boulevard &#x97; mightily challenges the acting and directorial skills on tap. Bill (Thomas Favaloro) is a successful indie director whose career has stalled since his last film, a mainstream Hollywood flop. Arriving at a restaurant for a meeting, he promptly sizes up waitress Gloria (Chelsea Turnbo) as a possible leading lady in what seems like a sleazy casting-couch manner, though there&#x27;s no indication Nguyen sees it that way. ill&#x27;s lunch dates are the first film&#x27;s leads: old friend Rob (Alan Bagh), a Silicon Valley-enriched millionaire, and Natalie (Whitney Moore), his model-turned-aspiring-actress ff. Rob commits to funding Bill&#x27;s comeback feature about the struggle to make it in Hollywood, the pro tags expressing awe that the subject&#x27;s never been done before. That settled, the four of them (now including Gloria, cast in the lead) traipse off to enjoy themselves at various Los Angeles attractions; these include the La Brea Tar Pits, where, for reasons murkily attributed to global warming, prehistoric eagles and vultures arise from the muck to attack humans.	1
I Abhorre this movie	None	Birdemic: Shock and Terror, the title perfectly displays how I feel about this movie, Shocked at how awful it is and in terror of as to why this movie was even made. However somehow my friend Danny seemingly enjoyed the special effects especially those rotating in circles and he said that its is the best movie he&#x27;s ever seen. He said the dive-bombing birds were particularly captivating. I however thought the effects looked like they were done with Windows Movie Maker or Scratch. Don&#x27;t watch this film, it is a waste of your life watch Rubber instead it is much more provocative and a better all round family film and includes fantastic actors, and a very interesting concept for a film, easy to understand and side-splitting entertainment for only 80 minutes.	1
Bad	Hell	&#x22;Hi, the eagles killed our friends- uh- do you have a phone I could use to call the police?&#x22;I fail to conjure words to describe this movie. This is the kind of movie you buy just so that when people come over and see it they say that they never heard of it and you&#x27;re like &#x22;wanna watch it&#x22; and they&#x27;re like &#x22;sure&#x22; so you put it on, sneak out the back-door, move to Mexico, and change your name. Bad acting, bad audio, bad CG, bad plot, BAD MOVIE. Just imagine what was going through those &#x22;actors&#x22; heads when they where swinging at nothing with wire hangers.I give it a 1/10- buy it and give it to someone you hate.	1
bad	Unknown	what isn&#x27;t crappy about this movie IDs! But what is: The acting The plot The characters The special effect AND even more WATCH IT NOW! AND YOU&#x27;ll LAUGH :) Now i&#x27;m just filling the lines but i can assure you this is one of those movies that&#x27;s good because its bad it should actually be number 1 because well it is bad even worse than dutch movies which suck too i can&#x27;t recommend dutch movies tho because they&#x27;re not bad enough to be good and funny no they are just plain bad IMDb WHY 10 LINES WHY!!!:( have you guys seen kingsman that one is really good :) and i&#x27;ld recommend that for everyone because it has tons of actions and a good story srry for my bad English btw :(	1
Beyond Painful	None	I found myself moaning and groaning and writhing for the first 20 minutes of watching this torturously embarrassing assault on my emotions &#x97; not because it was shocking or terrifying, but because it inadvertently contained every possible characteristic of bad filmmaking. The only reason I stopped suffering was because I began fast-forwarding. The only good things about this &#x22;film&#x22; were seeing locations that I recognized, and seeing a few attractive actresses in bikinis. Thank God they didn&#x27;t do any nude scenes. These poor young ladies would have lost chunks of their souls had they exposed themselves for the sake of absolutely the worst cinematic creation possible. Watching it made me ashamed to be human. I knew Birdemic would be bad, but I thought it might be fun to watch a cheesy horror film. It wasn&#x27;t. And I know you will think that what I&#x27;m about to write next is an exaggeration, but I swear to you it is not: I recently got a molar pulled in the dentist&#x27;s office, and this experience was far more enjoyable and far less painful than watching Birdemic. In the words of Joaquin Phoenix&#x27;s character in the movie 8MM, &#x22;There are some things that you see, and you can&#x27;t unsee them.&#x22; Don&#x27;t let Birdemic be one of them.	1
The holy grail of movies.	Australia	11/10, a masterpiece of cinematography. Way too under-rated/appreciated. The use of shots and sound gives you a really intense and emotional experience. If you have not witnessed the &#x22;Shock and Terror&#x22;, I feel sorry for you. I can not praise this film enough. I can not pick out one mistake in this film. The editing is phenomenal. It hits all the right notes in all the right places. Please, please, watch this movie. You definitely won&#x27;t regret it. It definitely signifies and shows how much the film industry has evolved. The CGI in this film can not be matched. My favourite scene hands down is when they fight the almost photo realistic birds with coat hangers, never in my life have i seen such a real and vivid display of true courage and bravery. I can not see how the actors and actresses in this film have not won any awards. Has the film critics become blind to absolute genius? This film for what it is worth should have been critically acclaimed but sadly no recognition has been given to this master-piece. Definitely the highlight of my life. Must watch.	10
Birdemic: Shock and Terror Or as I call it Birdemic: Stock and Error.	None	I first found out about this movie from a Jontron Review of it, so I decided to watch it, and I am literally speechless. It&#x27;s so freaking(not going to swear cause I might not be allowed to) bad! How bad do you ask? So 100,000,000 times bad! Looking at a rock all day would be better than this movie. Here are my reasons:1.) Terrible effects, since it had no studio support.2.) The conflict of the plot occurs 40 minutes later in the movie. And the conflict scene just shows up. *Sighs* Where did they even get this idea?3.) The acting was bad, but the guy who played Rod did his acting horrifically terrible. I&#x27;ve seen wood, but nothing is terrible than this guy.4.) The birds are just floating around doing nothing when they attack. They just hover around. Even when they attack the main characters while they try to get in their car. Comeon Becky! Turn those god darn keys! 5.) &#x22;So you&#x27;re a tree hugger?&#x22; lol6.) They forgot the gas tank while they were trying to get away. No wonder he ran out of gas. Should&#x27;ve thought of that...7.) You also get to see everything this guy does. (Warning: Spoiler!) You don&#x27;t do that in a horror movie.8.) The main characters&#x27; names are just Rod and Nathalie... No last names? 9.) The ending sucks. The birds just get chased away by doves. Doves... Yeah they just fly away. What is the point of that. 10.) Out of the most ridiculous of this, is the sex scene. The way he looks at her in her underwear just kills me. &#x22;No! Oh god! Nope stop! Now you stop that foot s*** right now!&#x22; -Jontron Those are the reasons why this movie is terrible. Also the scene on the bridge does remind me of the hermit that asks questions on the Bridge of Death in Monty Python&#x27;s Quest for the Holy Grail. &#x22;What....is your favorite color?&#x22; This is what I think of the movie. Also this was made with a budget of $10,000,	1
Shock and terror indeed...	None	Birdemic: Shock and Terror is the kind of movie that you know you want to see right after you saw the trailer. With something along the Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds in mind and $10.000 to spend, James Nguyen decided to make a movie. And what a movie... Almost everything is wrong about Birdemic. Acting is awful, editing is bad, camera work is bad. The cherry on the cake must be special effects. There is something special about them. Some combination between a 12 years old learning to use an graphic software and an 80 years old grandpa making sure everything is in place. Add all of the above with some &#x22;in your face&#x22; environmental message, and a love story, and you got the recipe for one of the worst movies ever made. I must admit that the music is kinda good. I bet that the guy that made it though that will be his breakthrough. You can hear his struggle in making the best soundtrack he ever made for Birdemic. The guy that made special effects, on the other hand, was like &#x22;well, motion stuff, yea, i can do those, i made some greeting cards last year!&#x22;. I must give one point for the courage the director had to throw such a big idea with so less money. Props for him!Definitely a must watch if you are interested into &#x22;so bad is good&#x22; category of movies.	2
Deadly comedy?	Bulgaria	Birdemic shock and terror is one stupid/funny movie with incredibly bad acting let&#x27;s don&#x27;t talk about the special effects the story is just ridiculous it&#x27;s just stupid so stupid it&#x27;s funny .I can&#x27;t tell if the people making this film we&#x27;re really trying to make it good or bad it&#x27;s just funny there were some scenes in the movie that i burst out laughing.like that moment when the eagles where falling in to the buildings or when they were trying to kill the eagles the sound effects were absolutely stupid.Birdemic shock and terror a movie about deadly eagles turns out to be just one great comedy.	1
THE BIRDS... with bad CGI!	United States	THE BIRDS, Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s legendary doomsday film. Taken from a short story, equally terrifying, it depicts an epidemic of bird attacks. In that film, we had seagulls, eagles, hawks, and the iconic crows all attacking people without any reason. It left audiences feeling haunted, especially with the downbeat finale. Between 1963 and 2010, filmmakers have been trying to return to that grandiose sense of avian terror. The closest they&#x27;ve ever come is RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION. But the difference between the two? RE:E featured CGI whereas Hitchcock used real birds. And when it&#x27;s done well, it&#x27;s extraordinary. BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR is a film about an apocalypse of birds. But it features laughably bad CGI. (Come on, birds don&#x27;t fly with their feet hanging down!) And that&#x27;s just the tip of the iceberg. In the story, our hero asks a girl out on a date. And after some asinine dialogue, they have a romantic night. Only to wake up and discover... AH, THE BIRDS ARE ATTACKING! Now, they&#x27;re on the run, and trying to survive the flying pixels. Firing their guns (where&#x27;d they suddenly get those?) that are clearly toy guns. Once in a while, one of the survivors will die from being stupid. Leaving us rolling in the aisles, literally. I think there might have even been a character or two who died twice. The acting is excruciating, as you can probably imagine. Along with cinematography (they filmed with cheap video cameras), editing, music, scriptwriting, and directing. Sadly, the copy I stopped working about fifty minutes in. But that was more than enough. Maybe that was a sign from above? Now I see why this earns the NUMBER 1 spot as the WORST FILM OF ALL TIMES!	1
Birds attacking people, where have I heard that before	England	This was shown in theatres! Are you kidding me?Problem 1: Story; it&#x27;s taken from Alfred Hitchcocks The Birds Problem 2: Acting; it&#x27;s wooden (I think a plank of wood would have been a better casting choice, now that you think about it. Problem 3: The birds do not stat killing people until the halfway point. Problem 4: Dialogue is on The Room level. Problem 5: No Redeeming features. Problem 6: It SUCKS! Problem 7: Low production values. Problem 8: College film level quality in editing and shooting. One minute it&#x27;s okay, the next it looks bad Problem 9: Awful CGI and effects.Overall, this is the worst film I have seen yet. There is nothing good in this pile of cinematic excrement.	1
A boy meets a girl who is a model and they develop a love relationship. But suddenly a lot of birds attack, and kills many people. No one knows why.	None	Okay. So I have now seen Birdemic and my feelings are a big chaos. I don&#x27;t know where to begin. If you take the most stiff actors of the century, making them speak a lot of lines of total bullshit (such as surrealistic pick-up lines and strange dialogues), in a story without any point at all, combined with movie effects that not even the 90&#x27;s can be excused for, and mash it up with the most terrible sound you could ever imagine and music that could be taken directly from The Sims, then you get Birdemic: Shock and Terror.To begin with new nothing happens for approximately 45 minutes. It all seems to be about a guy who meets a future Victoria&#x27;s Secret Model, something he does not seem to be impressed about. At least not from the acting. The actors&#x27; facial and talking expressions seem to be a nothing but a desperate &#x22;take me out of here!&#x22;, thinking about their total lack of enthusiasm. Anyway, they fall in love, and that&#x27;s all you need to know since barely anything else happens.Somewhere in these 45 minutes you will see a total of three birds. The story is said to be about birds, so you will sit there for a while wondering whenever something related to birds will happen. Or if it ever will happen. Anyway, these three birds are weirdly bad made. We know this movie only had a budget of 10 000$ but I don&#x27;t even know if that can be an excuse. The effects from gun shots and the wildfire that suddenly breaks out look like something that was made in Paint in 5 minutes, and the animated birds at the rest of the movie when they appear seem to be breaking the laws of physics, with the terrible and unrealistic motion of theirs.But the worst thing with this movie might be the sound. I don&#x27;t even think they actually had any microphone except for the one at the camera. Some lines disappear into all noise that the sound technician totally forgot to clean up, the volume changes all throughout the movie, and sometimes there is no sound at all. The music, from which I almost got feels from my childhood where I sat making families and pretending to be some kind of architect, doesn&#x27;t fit with the story or scenes at all, and the entire film might be better if you just could delete it all.Birdemic is a film in the genres horror, thriller, and romance, and the director James Nguyen is describing himself as &#x22;the Master of romantic thrillers&#x22;. Well.To sum it up, this is the most terrible movie I&#x27;ve ever seen and any movie is better than this. I don&#x27;t even see how this could be distributed since it all feels more like some kind of parody. An incredibly bad one. But strangely, the film actually does entertain. You will probably laugh your ass off.Peace.	1
