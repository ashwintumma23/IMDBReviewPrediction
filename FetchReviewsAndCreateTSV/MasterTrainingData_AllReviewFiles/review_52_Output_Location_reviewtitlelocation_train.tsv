Himmatwala Review- An old fashioned but entertaining film	india	Movie: Himmatwala Rating: 4/5After seeing my rating, most of you will think why I did this. Actually, I liked this movie. I did not find a reason to dislike it at all. Except of the fact that the film is a bit old fashioned, there is nothing bad, its an entertainer.Himmatwala, in other words, has a good story, screenplay, performances, comedy, action, music etc as per the hype. Ajay Devgn does his role with perfection as always. He is able to do full justice with the character. Tamannaah is not only cute and beautiful, but acts as well. In fact, her performance is the best in the movie. Others also do well. The songs are good and manage to recreate the retro feel. The action scenes are well choreographed and performed, they are the ones to come up with perfection after a long time. The story is good and also some emotional scenes are also well enacted.On the whole, Himmatwala is an entertainer, without any negatives, but if you have to watch it, be sure you haven&#x27;t watched the original one first, just like me!	8
Stay As Far as Possible from Sajid khan Film!!!	Bangladesh	I remember Sajid khan made an statement prior release this film where he claim HIMMATWALAWill be the biggest hit of the year. That is my only guide to this movie and it was a massive blunder To trust this unabashed, dismal guy! I just lost my word after 10-15 minute &#x26; wonder whether cry or laugh!!The jokes was awful, unbearable&#x85;I never seen any 1 try this hard to make audience laugh and yet him/her Become ridicule. There was no story at all, Emotional seen make you laugh even more than joke, action seen were ridiculous,Better suit to a comic hero than film hero (slap a Tiger!!!).Heroine looks good in all songs but acting left lot to desire,Ajay must be ripping his hair off for his decision to sign this film..he could easily do without a sloppy role such as this. All I can say about sajid khan is he is a big NOTHING, a big disaster, a shameless, brainless, useless, hopeless fellow! Even Sajid &#x26; his family member could not watch this nightmare for 2/3 Hour let alone audience. If any 1 even thinking Of watching this movie just FORGET it, even if some 1 pay you to watch..now you know how bad is this movie!!!	1
Text book example! how not to do a movie!	Cambridge, UK	Usually I don&#x27;t mind no brainer entertainers at least they bring some smile on your face. I am not going to comment on story because lack of it was expected as I knew I was going to watch Sajid Khan&#x27;s movie. But this movie didn&#x27;t even do justice even with its genre. There was only one good joke and that was on save the tiger which was already running TV adverts day in and day out. If Sajid Khan didn&#x27;t come with a good movie anytime soon then this might be his career&#x27;s last. I reckon that everyone from film crew who must have seen pre-screen should have stopped the movie. If projects turn out to be so bad then it should be benched.	1
U need a lot of (himmat) courage  to sit thru this one.....	Bangalore, India	The 1980s were the dark ages of Hindi Cinema. The worst films came from there. Actually, its very easy for any person to make a list of the 10 best Hindi films of the 80s (due to lack of competition) and a difficult task to make a list of the 10 worst Hindi films of the 80s (due to heavy competition).The original Himmatwala belonged to no mans land. It was neither good nor bad....OK for the 80s. But hats off to Sajid Khan, he ensure the remake will hands down appear in the list of the worst films of this decade.What was Sajid Khan smoking while writing this movie?? Frankly, he is an idiot who thinks he makes gr8 cinema. Sorry Sajid but every time crap can&#x27;t make money at BO. I&#x27;ve no words to describe this film and had lost my senses by the time it got over. Many yrs ago, In &#x27;Yaadien&#x27; to make Hrithik and Kareena fall in love, the legendary Subhash Ghai used a crocodile. Guess what, Sajid uses a tiger...yup !! And he goes a step further. In the climax, when Devgn&#x27;s character is being beaten up and his mother calls for help, the same tiger reappears and saves Devgn. Yup !! U have to see it to believe it.I really don&#x27;t know why Devgn who such a brilliant actor is doing such crap. And over the years, he staring in crap films like Golmaal series, Rascals, Son of Sardar and now Himmatwala is baffling. The original worked because Amjad Khan, Kader Khan and Jeetendra shared some good on screen chemistry. Nothing works here.My sincere advise...if u want to watch Devgn, watch him in Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam or Company or even Singham. And if want to watch a tiger on screen, then Life of Pi is a far better choice.	2
Himmat Wala - A Tribute To Amitabh and Not To Jetendra	Karachi, Pakistan	Before reviewing the new Himmatwala, allow me to introduce you with some facts related to 1983&#x27;s Himmatwala. K. Raghavendra Rao&#x27;s Himmatwala (1983) was an experimental film, in which he signed a sinking mega-star of early 1980&#x27;s Jetendra, whose movies were drowning deeply at the box office back in those days. Similarly, Sridevi was signed because of limited budget as she was planning to leave the industry because of constant flops. On the contrary, Kader Khan, who used to play negative roles, was also not getting any movies. The concept of remakes of south Indian movies was also fresh at that period of time. So, all in all, it was their hard work and commendable script with astounding performances which made Himmatwala a fare that not only started the team (Jetendra, Sridevi, Kader Khan, Amjad Khan, Shakti Kapoor and Asrani) to launch numerous block-busters but also gave a reason to copy it even after 3 decades. Sajid Khan&#x27;s Himmatwala is a literal copy of the original Himmatwala. Although, he has mentioned at many platforms that his movie has a few elements of the original one but if you see the original movie, dialogues, character names, scenes and at places background score have also copied from it. There are minor amendments which add no weight to the movie.If Sajid Khan says that this particular movie is a tribute to 1980&#x27;s cinema then he should rephrase it as a tribute to the &#x22;Young Angry Man&#x22; of 1980&#x27;s Amitabh&#x27;s movies. The reason to quote this is that 5 action scenes from this movie reminded me of Amitabh&#x27;s movies. A &#x96; Title Track reminded me of Shan&#x27;s &#x22;Pyar Karnewalay Pyar Kartay Hain Shaan Se&#x22;, filmed on Parveen Babi. B &#x96; Cage fight of Ajay Devgan made me recall Amitabh&#x27;s cage fight from Naseeb. C &#x96; The scene where Ajay Devgan holds the dagger from sharp end while saving his sister from &#x22;Dhanna&#x22;, reminds me of the scene from &#x22;Kaala Patthar&#x22; where Amitabh did the same with a character named &#x22;Dhanna&#x22; (played by Ashok Saxena). D &#x96; The much talked about tiger fight again makes me recall Amitabh&#x27;s tiger fight from &#x22;Khoon Pasiina&#x22;. E &#x96; The fight sequence just before the song &#x22;Bump Pe Laat&#x22; where Ajay converses in 5 different languages with goons gives me a vivid remembrance of a similar scene from Amitabh&#x27;s &#x22;Laawaris&#x22;Anyways, the plot is similar and it tells a story of a malicious Sarpanch Sher Singh (Mahesh Manjrekar) who defames Ravi&#x27;s (Ajay Devgan) father to an extent where he commits suicide and his family suffers a lot of pain. Years after, Ravi returns to take revenge from Sarpanch. I am a fan of 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s movies, this was the mere reason why I chose to watch the new Himmatwala but experience was nothing but sheer pain. First of all, Ajay looks totally misfit for the role; he failed to pass the wittiness which Jetendra portrayed in his style. His &#x22;Atta Maajhi Sattakli&#x22; style has now stuck to him &#x96; its time to come up with something original and much entertaining. Mahesh Manjhrekar is a very talented actor but he looks cheap and acts loud in this fare. Even he failed to meet Amjad Khan&#x27;s comical expressions and terrifying persona. Adhyayan Suman as Shakti does not even come close to Shakti Kapoor in a single scene. Tamanna Bhatia (a renowned and successful Tamil actress) has screen presence but when it comes to performing, she needs to focus on that. The only character that stands out (to some extent) in the movie is Paresh Rawal (enacting the role of Kader Khan). He manages to copy the appearance and tone of Kader Khan and with his dialogues, his earnest attempt is visible in every scene. Asrani is the only actor who has appeared in both the Himmatwalas but in the newer version he is wasted. Ritesh Deshmukh appears in a cameo and he is as usual &#x96; typical. Zarina Wahab is efficient. It&#x27;s saddening that this film has great performers and super stars but even then the film failed to create a magic at the box office.If you really want to get heavy dose of entertainment watch the original one.Rating 3.5 / 10	3
entertainer	new delhi	The Film is a remake of the 1983 blockbuster &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; *ing Jeetendra &#x26; Sreedevi.Ajay Devgan as Ravi did a great job, except in dance sequences. The punch lines, fights, ferocity in the eyes etc hit the bulls eye. Tamanna looked beautiful but needs to work on her acting skills..Paresh Rawal,was great nd was really entertaining..Zarina Wahab was good, so is Leena Jumani, Ajay&#x27;s sister! Junior Suman as usual wasted, mahesh manjerakar was a biggest disappointment, he was total misfit , he lacked that cruelness nd even comic sense which was expected..	10
80s Reloaded has some good moments	nz	I have seen the Jeetu starring Himmatwala. And i have to admit the kind of humor and typical humor of 80&#x27;s. It has been captured well and reincorporated in this project by Sajid Khan. In my opinion because the audience has grown from 80s and has become more mature. It might seem too lengthy or boring or senseless. But that is how movies of 80;s were at that time. If you have patience and if you were charmed by 80s era. You will absolutely love the movie and think of it as a visual delight. Humour fun and lot of drama with fantastic comedy scenes. Music has been themed after 80&#x27;s era as well. Very peppy and upbeat music although fewer songs would have done more justice as audience is losing patience these days. I hope it appeals to audience who were born before 1990&#x27;s. I am sure Iphone might not relate to it much.	7
Movie of 90s	India	I watched the movie. It was a good movie. The Director has tried his level best to depict the scene of 90s movies. I want to tell all the people who has given such a horrible reviews saying that the movie was awful... that YOU don&#x27;t have the sense of watching movie. The director tried to take us back to enjoy the 90s movie. Istead you started comparing it to the latest movies. Think and than review. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. Just don&#x27;t judge too quickly. Any ways the movie direction was not too good. But we must enjoy movie. Movie is to be entertained rather than to use our brain always when we watch the movie. If we think too much, we will miss many good shots.And if anybody don&#x27;t agree with me .. I don&#x27;t give a F**k.Thank You!	5
Difficult to digest this typical eighties mellow drama	Mumbai, India	Now cinema has grown up very much so audiences are ready to accept new way of presentation of emotions. This is a typical hard core mellow drama film. A person life is in danger. Her mother prays to Goddess Durga, for saving his life and suddenly a Tiger appears and saves him. Makers have followed very closely the old Himmatwla (Jeetendra and Shri Devi starrer). There is no any new approach on this old subject. So, if you love to watch something new. This movie will disappoint you for sure. Even few dialogues from old one has been repeated. Performance wise Ajay Devgan s OK. Paresh Raval and Mahesh Manjrekar are superb. Tamnna fails to impress except in the song &#x22;Naino Me Sapna&#x85;&#x22; Actress who played Ajay Devgan sister is fine. They have also kept the old track of film and certainly they are very good in comparison to the other songs.	5
Blast From The Past!	India	An official remake of the 1983 blockbuster of the same name, which was directed by K. Raghavendra Rao &#x26; starred Jeetendra and Sridevi, &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27;, Directed by Sajid Khan, is old wine in an old bottle. Its A Blast From The Past! &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; takes us back in time, when Hindi Cinema relied on South-Remakes to keep the cash register&#x27;s running. Stars like Jeetendra, Mithun Chakraborty, Sridevi, Anil Kapoor, to name a few, starred in the remakes which were major successes back in the day.Sajid delivers &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; plainly, his film is a cut-copy-paste 80&#x27;s potboiler, that stays true to its genre. However, the film is strictly aimed at the masses. Its primarily for the front-bencher&#x27;s!&#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; tells the story of a Brave Son&#x27;s battle to abolish an evil landlord, who was responsible for his father&#x27;s death. &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; isn&#x27;t meant to be taken seriously &#x26; I not for a single minute took it seriously in any which manner. But, Sajid&#x27;s Screenplay, definitely could&#x27;ve been stronger. Sajid&#x27;s Direction, on the other-hand, is mediocre. Cinematography &#x26; Editing are fair. Action-Sequences will be loved by the masses, its target audience. Music by Sajid-Wajid is foot-tapping. Art Design is first-class.Performance-Wise: Ajay is a competent actor &#x26; he plays the unbeatable hero, with sincerity. He&#x27;s the soul of the film. Tamannaah looks stunning, but gets limited scope. Zarina Wahab is exceptional, yet again. Paresh Rawal &#x26; Mahesh Manjrekar play the villains with ease. Leena Jumani is functional. Adhyayan Suman is alright. Ritesh Deshmukh appears in a small role. Sonakshi Sinha sizzles in the opening song.On the whole, &#x27;Himmatwala&#x27; is a film for the masses.	5
