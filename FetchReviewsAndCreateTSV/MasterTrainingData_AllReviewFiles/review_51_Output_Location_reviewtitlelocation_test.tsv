To Carnal Christian and to The Gospel rejecting population need to learn Biblical History	United States	This is my updated review on Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas, and it has been submitted to IMDb for review.. Will it be on IMDb? I would say more of a no, than a yes.(1) Book of Genesis and the Origins of trees (God created the trees) and winter solstice (astronomy of the planets aligning with this particular solar system), and their actual meanings; (2) Book of Exodus - specifically about the Tabernacle and what inside of the Structure, and their references; (3) Saint Nick (known as Santa Clause) and that he was part of the Council of Nicea, that he was also born-again, and help others with gifts. (4) Books of the Gospels (which are technically Old Testament) - Tree is the main central theme, in that Christ is God Incarnate (Fully Man and Fully God); He (Christ/Messiah) was born in swaddling (burial) clothes, that He was meant to die. He couldn&#x27;t sin at all, and He was tested at all points, and still did not sin at all; He (Christ/Messiah) was beaten, Crucified on a Roman built Cross, died, covered in swaddling clothes, then buried for 3 days and 3 nights, and rose again (Resurrected). Why did He (Jesus Christ/Yeshua Messiah) do this? He did it for you, for every man, woman, and child is born a sinner because of Adam in the book of Genesis sinned, and we inherited this sin nature. This is what the movie is really about! It&#x27;s about the Gospel, that Christ died for sinners! People who say &#x27;Christmas is pagan&#x27;, need to watch this movie, and then go back to the Origins, from the book of Genesis, whether&#x27;s it&#x27;s in your Torah or Tanak, New Testament, Gospels, History, Apostolic Writings, and/or Bible. This movie is really a commentary of Biblical History, and that you can still receive Salvation for your sins, and that you can be a child of God through Christ&#x27;s Blood Sacrifice (The Perfect Lamb of God, Old Covenant typology).The media in news and movie reviewers view &#x22;evil is good&#x22;, and &#x22;good is evil&#x22;, and view this as the &#x22;worst movie ever&#x22; (in reference to Saving Christmas).. Really, it&#x27;s the worst movie ever? Are you sure? What about James Cameron&#x27;s Titanic, which really wasn&#x27;t about the Titanic? I mean, you see the Titanic here and their, but it&#x27;s about adultery, if you understand the term and it&#x27;s origins: engagement, and it really means = to be married.What about Michael Bay&#x27;s Transformers (2007)? You get the Transformers with very few lines to them (robot characters), and the lines are given to an actor and an actress, who are unknown until this movie came out. I felt like I was watching a cross-between Bill &#x26; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure and Clueless (which I can&#x27;t recommend either movie). I would hear from people in my area, that it was &#x22;a good movie!&#x22; and &#x22;Megan Fox is hot!&#x22;, and in translation: &#x22;Good special effects, hot girl, and no substance to the story at all.&#x22; Is their such a thing called movie plagiarism? It would apply to this particular movie!What about the recent Noah by Darren Aronofsky? This is behind the grade F-, and it fact, this is a very heretical version of Noah. It only had about 5 good points to the mass amount of liberties and rejects the Biblical History altogether..What did these three do, along with other movies who fall hard in Hermeneutical and Exegetical (Science and Art of Interpretation, letting the writer(s) speak for themselves, and having good application to what&#x27;s being written/said) standards? In the fiction historical background, and non-fiction (literal history) accounts who fail to follow manuscripts in history, and it fact, people get praised to doing something that receives an F-, and get ridiculed for A+ when it comes to movies, documentaries, and commentaries. It&#x27;s really: &#x22;Let&#x27;s apply A+ to Ivy Leagues with their buy-out program&#x22; and &#x22;Let&#x27;s apply F- to who understand True Interpretation of things.&#x22;In today&#x27;s society and since the 1920s-1930s, the view is: &#x22;reject it: if it convicts us, you need to a full 180 in your so-called life style (it&#x27;s really a death-style), corrects these forms of so-called theologians views (nazists, fascist, communists, socialists = aka liberal and moderates), has True Supernatural substance to it, and it&#x27;s True Historical accounts, it doesn&#x27;t do my homework (research) for me&#x22; which Saving Christmas actually does. Yep, you get to your homework (research) on this Bible Commentary, Bible History, and actually documentational History (do Origin Source Research)..While the majority of society (not just in North America) embrace superficiality (i.e. Transformers, Titanic, Noah), and reject Hermeneutical and Exegetical standards, and perform Eisegesis (let&#x27;s take a mass amount of liberties, and give a folklore, myths, add deceptions here and their), and it does my homework (research) for me. It&#x27;s: &#x22;Oh, I don&#x27;t have to my homework for me! Hooray! I can be lazy!&#x22; Come on! Push yourself! Overwhelm your selfishness! Do the homework! Stop being lazy!This is a great example, to show, that Kirk Cameron wants to speak the majority who are in the two world-views: (a) Laodicean society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of Revelation, Chapter 3). (b) Corinthian society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of 1st and 2nd Corinthians).	10
Great Content  Great Quotes... Santas the man!	None	I saw this movie, with a bunch of friends &#x26; family at a Regal theater. Although it was a different style than what I was expecting, in that there was a lot of narration, the overall content was great! Basically, it was a celebration of the meaning of Christmas and it had funny one-liners like...&#x22;Santa&#x27;s the Man!&#x22; Plus, I really enjoyed the scene with the two guys who were rapping behind the mugs were hilarious! Lol #GoodTimes The actual filming too had some nice effects that flowed well with the story-line. I bet most of the people writing reviews are &#x22;haters&#x22; who didn&#x27;t even see it! #YouKnowItsTrue #BahHumbug Great Job to those who made this! Great Information! Merry Christmas!	10
One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time	United States	I viewed this movie the first week it came out, and it is simply a wonderful movie. Every movie that Kirk Cameron does is great. All freedom loving, patriotic Americans will love this movie. Do not be fooled by all the bad reviews by all the lefty, Obama loving, liberals putting down this wonderful movie. None of the people who have given this movie a bad rating have even seen this movie. If they had actually viewed the movie, they too would love it. The movie itself concerns Kirk Cameron speaking to his brother-in-law about the joys of Christmas and the joys of loving, close knit families. This is another reason all the loony left hates this movie, they hate anything to do with intact, man-woman, families or God. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie.	10
Definitely not a 10, nor a 1	USA	This movie is not a &#x27;10&#x27;, and not a &#x27;1&#x27;, either. Why are the vast majority of the votes either 1&#x27;s or 10&#x27;s, then? Because people are voting their worldview, instead of voting on a movie.It is hard to categorize this film - if I had to categorize it, I would call it a Christian docudrama, or Christian Christmas movie. In my opinion, an hour long television program would have been a better format for this effort, than an hour and twenty minute theatrical release.It is a low-budget digital independent film, and the production values reflect that. It sets out to present a conservative Christian point of view, and does that openly and unapologetically. There was nothing that I found intolerant or mean spirited, and it seemed rather to espouse traditional Christian values of Christmas, such as &#x22;Peace on Earth, Goodwill toward All&#x22; - although that line does not occur in the film.The bottom line is: if you are a conservative Christian, then you will probably enjoy this movie or at least find it interesting. The further your worldview departs from that, the less enjoyable you will likely find it.	6
Semi-documentary--Meant to Inform More Than Entertain	United States	I like Kirk Cameron&#x27;s stuff. Let me put that out there. I understand where he is coming from and tend to enjoy it. &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; was informative but draggy. The format--two guys speaking together in a parked car on a driveway--tends to make the movie narrative and leads to an extremely slow pace. With a little livelier pacing and some editing (to remove the pregnant pauses), the message could have been presented in 45 minutes. I did not go into this movie thinking it would be a comedy, so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. However, the comic relief presented was a little strained and contrived.There is, actually, very little acting. The descriptive parts frame a number of vignettes that illustrate what is being discussed. In between different themes, a party is going on. Some of the party sequences made little sense. There is one sequence where two coworkers are talking behind coffee cups (presumably to keep from being seen on video discussing things at work) which has absolutely nothing to do with moving the story and, mercifully, is never addressed again until the out-takes.That having been said, I came away with some information that I did not know or had never thought about before seeing the movie. I believe the message should be heard by Christians and, thankfully, it is aimed directly at Christians. I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my time in the movie, but I feel like it could have been presented more evenly. My suggestion is to support Mr. Cameron by seeing his other stuff and borrowing this movie from the Church Library.	3
Finally, a REAL Christmas movie	None	A wonderful and fun spirited NON Hollywood movie about keeping Christ in Christmas with NO Hollywood liberal agenda or spin involved. Must see for Christians. No cursing, no questioning God or religion. It was really refreshing when everything that seems to ooze out of Hollywood (including the actors themselves) these days, is either bashing the foundations of this great country or bashing Christians. Kirk Cameron tackles the traditions and questions about Christmas and it&#x27;s commercialization head on and with no apologies. If you are a Christian and it is your favorite Holiday as it is mine, Saving Christmas is a must see.	10
Awesome Movie	Minneapolis, MN USA	I saw the movie, and it was great. Interesting, funny, enlightening - I loved it. On Reddit I saw that readers are calling on &#x22;all atheists&#x22; to give this movie a 1 Star rating - even if they haven&#x27;t seen it. Don&#x27;t believe the low rating its been getting. Very misleading. Kirk does an excellent job of putting together a family friendly film. It&#x27;s not too preachy - it&#x27;s actually anything but that. The characters are endearing. The jokes come at all the perfect times. My family got the biggest kick out of some of the humor. Way better than 99% of the garbage Hollywood puts out these days. I guarantee anyone rating it low has not actually seen it, and are simply haters.	10
Educational movie with a touch of family comedy	United States	Made me think more about the reasons for celebrating Christmas. Helps me to see that I can focus on the true meaning of Christmas while partaking in the celebrations of the season. The main character named Christian did an excellent job and was enjoyable to watch. The others in the cast provided the right amount of lighthearted humor. There was a good balance of scenes between Christian and Kirk Cameron and the main party. Kirk Cameron is known for producing great movies and people have a certain expectation from his films. This film seems to be marketed as a full action comedy which sets expectations different than what the movie actually is. I liked it. Just know it has more of an educational approach with light humor.	7
Perfect film to smash the humbugs	United States	People who are sick of the commercialization of Christmas and are ready to give it all up will appreciate this movie. People who are not familiar with Christianity will not get this movie or think it&#x27;s bogus. However anyone familiar with the history of the church will recognize the story of Nicolas of Myrna and his role in the Council of Nicea. The recounting of the events of the original St. Nick will put a new spin on the Ho Ho Ho! This was a great way to spend an afternoon leading up to the celebration of the birth of Christ. It&#x27;s not a special effects bad guy hero film, but it is what it promises to be and it fulfills its promises well. I highly recommend it and wish it was going to be in theaters longer.	10
Educational Movie - Made For TV Quality	United States	Well we saw the movie. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I thought it was going to be a regular movie. Instead, it was an educational movie; he gave you different reasons, ideas and ways to think about the Christmas of today. He also discussed how the different factions would like you to think about Christmas; it&#x27;s all Pagan, there&#x27;s nothing about Christ left in it, why the tree, why the 25th of December, etc., and how to keep it based on faith, etc. Not bad. Internet Haters will hate on this but this movie isn&#x27;t for the regular movie public, it&#x27;s for believers and kids. I do agree that the poster is misleading; if you judge the movie by the poster you would think that it&#x27;s a comedy - family - faith based movie. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s an educational, faith based movie, with a few laugh, but it&#x27;s not a scripted comedy in the least. Run time was short as well which was good. Pretty tight and to the point.	7
