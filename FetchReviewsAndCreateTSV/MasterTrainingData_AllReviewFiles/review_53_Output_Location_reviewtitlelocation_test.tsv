I want 105 minutes of my life back.	New Zealand	Why would anyone give this film anything higher than 1? All this film had was crappy acting, stupid FX that didn&#x27;t even look real, and a $10,000 budget.The film: Takes 47 minutes before the birdemic actually begins, worst dialog ever, and I think the entire film was shot on a toy camera, because, well... the wind can be heard throughout the entire film.The effects: Makes Sharknado look like Avatar. You know what&#x27;s worse? Almost all of the names listed in the credits are fake.I don&#x27;t even know why I warned people about spoilers, because this film is so bad it doesn&#x27;t need to be seen by anyone. It really is that bad.My reviews are always pretty short, mainly because I suck at writing reviews, so I&#x27;m just going to describe this film in the most simple way: It makes The Room, Troll 2, Battlefield Earth and Jaws 4 look like masterpieces. Save your money for something else.	1
this movie is so bad that is why it is called shock and terror	None	i mean seriously? WTF? XD -the birds look like an 8 year old kids project.-worst sound ever. there are sound cuts.-an orangutan can act better as a human being.- nothing in this movie makes sense.-first 45 minutes is boring as hell.-its &#x22;birdimic&#x22; what do you expect?.-the birds have WW2 sound effects. also they EXPLODE ON IMPACT.-much more like 1/100.this is amazingly bad. makes troll 2 looks like the lord of the rings. it might be entertaining to a degree. watch it at your own risk.	1
By no doubt, the worst movie ever made. But also something everybody should watch!	Sweden	Most people usually say that if you put time and effort into something, the result will always be good. James Nguyen spent a total of four years making Birdemic, and he proved the opposite. This movie, is one of the worst movies ever made, if not the worst. But I think people should watch this. I especially think that this is something that should be shown at different film schools, instead of movies like Citizen Kane. You learn by your mistakes right? Well, then you learn by watching a bad movie and not masterpieces.Birdemic is about a small Californian town which gets attacked by deadly birds one day. These birds don&#x27;t appear until 45 minutes into the film, so there&#x27;s also a lot more to this film. The most notable thing is that the movie follows the main character&#x27;s full day, and I&#x27;m not kidding. You get to see him driving, working and eating. And these sequences are long, and also pointless. Already after the introduction, you start noticing how poorly made this film is. The sound quality is very bad, and the track often goes to very quiet to very loud. The video quality isn&#x27;t very good either, but since I&#x27;m a indie movie maker myself I don&#x27;t have any problems with that. But the script, directing and most of all acting is so poor.Alan Bagh who plays the main character in Birdemic, is the worst actor I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie. He just looks so bored and uninspired in all of his scenes. The supporting actors are still a bit better, but that doesn&#x27;t save the movie. It is when the birds arrives that you really start noticing how poorly made this film is.The birds looks awful. They look so fake and they&#x27;re all the same. The birds literally just attack the humans by basically flying in front of them. These special effects are also what makes the movie so funny and bad. The scenes are so far away from horror as possible. And the birds make a sound that gives you an headache within a second.The movie continues to be a bad film throughout. Everything about this movie is so bad. But as I said, I think everyone should still watch this. It is the best worst movie ever, but someone actually spent time doing this. And I appreciate it more than modern art.	1
Birdemic a study on why just because you have a video camera doesnt mean you should make a movie	None	Well I just watched the RiffTrax version of the movie and still wanted to bash my brains out with a 2x4 full of rusty nails. Mostly due to the fact that this movie could be used as a torture device for any human being that is a fan of the cinematic art form known as moving pictures. Their are some movies so god awful that they are fun to watch I.E. Sharknado and The Happening. The main difference between those pieces of dog sh*t and this piece of dog sh*t is that this movie thinks its being artsy and delivering a brilliant subtle world altering message while assuming that the audience has the intelligence level of the week old splooge inside the jeans of a ten year old boy tragically born with fetal alcohol syndrome. The movie proves how dumb it believes its audience to be by making all of Rod&#x27;s business deals with NTC software end in nice even round numbers like 1 million dollars and 1 billion dollars. Then he creates a company in a week and its immediately financed by the dumbest and or laziest venture capitalist group in the world for a nice even 10 million dollars. Then when literally out of nowhere the Birdemic hits for no plausible reason whatsoever the movie starts bashing us over the head with global warming propaganda that was written by that same ten year old with fetal alcohol syndrome I mentioned earlier. This movie was made slightly bearable by the guys at RiffTrax because at least they made me laugh but this movie has made me hate people named Rod and if ever a Victoria Secret cover model walks up to me I&#x27;m running away in fear and immediately relapsing on a lethal dose of Heroin you know just in case she even slightly reminds me of this waste of 1.3 GB that the servers of the world will never get back! Oh and yeah forgot to mention that Rod&#x27;s girlfriend for the movie is a Victoria Secret cover model because we wouldn&#x27;t know she was a hot soulless mouth breathing waste of oxygen unless the movie told us she was a model! P.S. I&#x27;m also an Afghanistan veteran and they manage to throw a why can&#x27;t we all just get along line from an marine and Iraqi war veteran which is the only realistic part of the movie Army rules Marine Corp. drools na ni na ni boo boo! (sticks tongue out and makes farty noises)	1
A must see, Highly entertaining	Oslo	Where should I start - This movie is so poorly made, it&#x27;s an artform. Of course this has been done on purpose; but It is not easy to make something as poor as this movie. It is highly entertaining, I haven&#x27;t laughed this much watching a movie ever. The animated clipart birds, explosions and the other effects - (cut and paste) is simply incredible. The story line, random politics, romance, the dialogues, the acting... so incredibly poor; How did they do it? Considering it is so poor, it is so entertaining I wanted to give it a 10 out of 10, but that would not be fair, as this is the worst movie ever - and doesn&#x27;t deserve to lose it&#x27;s pole position at the IMDb bottom 100.	1
This movie	United States	Well kids gather around its time for a story about a movie that is like ktulu in the fact that looking at it will drive you to madness. This movie made me rethink my life and why I was willing to waste my time alive watching this. First the birdemic starts 45 min into the story and you couldn&#x27;t really care less at this point your looking off into space wishing you could just Cobain yourself and end it all but no still more movie. The birds in this movie look just awful. These birds apparently have the ability to hover in front of people because reasons. Also little known fact you can fight off birds with coat hangers. All the people that die in this movie die of stupidly as everyone seems to pullover and roll there windows down and let the birds claw them to death. On top of that they try to hit you over the head with anti global warming and Iraq bull that your really not in the mood to hear at this point. This movie is one of those special films that make other movies look better. Watch this and you&#x27;ll never complain about how bad a movie is again this makes the catwoman, the room, and sharknadio look astounding. By the way the ending is bad to. I still am torn between laughing my self to death and flying into a rage after realizing I had actually sat threw the whole thing. DON&#x27;T SEE THIS MOVIE	1
Bore-demic: Schlock and Terrible!	California	I&#x27;m convinced the people who say this movie is &#x22;The best worst movie ever!&#x22; haven&#x27;t actually SEEN the whole thing, and are only commenting on abridged versions from YouTube clips. This things kinda a bore.Don&#x27;t get me wrong. There ARE some (unintentionally) hilarious parts (mostly when our &#x22;heroes&#x22; get attacked by a particularly vengeful Playstation game...er I mean &#x22;birds&#x22;) However the GCI atrocities don&#x27;t even show up until the movies halfway point and only pop up occasionally afterwords. Like many other bad movies, this has massive pacing problems making the film a very dull slog. So what do we get while we&#x27;re waiting for the Winged Clip-Art of Doom to strike? We get an ENDLESS supply of driving and parking scenes that, if cut, would render the remaining footage about 15 minutes long. (And bad driving scenes to boot. These have all the thrill of Driving Miss Daisy, even AFTER the squawking GIFs start attacking.) And then about 13 of THOSE minutes is filled with pointless character after pointless character filibustering about global warming or some environmentalist issue told in that oh-so exciting &#x22;Guess-what-I-copied-directly-from- Wikipedia-without-actually-reading?&#x22; tone of voice. I kept waiting for Captain Planet and the Ferngully fairy to show up and rant about how unsubtle it all is. For the lover in you we even get a turgid &#x22;romance&#x22; between two pieces of plywood...er our heroes (You&#x27;ll never look at a pumpkin festive the same again.)But like I said there are SOME amusing moments to dull the pain, if you like seeing marble-mouthed dull-witted leading man who walk with the limber gait of the Frankenstein monster, plenty of flubbed lines that show that the word &#x22;retake&#x22; is not in directors vocabulary, the most jaded assemble of extras ever (a Birdemic is no reasons traffic in the background can&#x27;t proceed as normal, right?), inept salesmen who CHEER when they lose one million dollars on a sale, and of course site of our no-talent cast pretending to interact with special (ed?) effects eagles that would look poorly rendered on a circa-1997 Geocities website. But those are just an oasis of hilarious ineptitude in a painfully dull sea of padding. Maybe it&#x27;s easier to deal with as a group or &#x22;audience&#x22; to share the misery, but otherwise this is slow, plodding mess.	1
Birdemic review	None	I do not write reviews often, but this time i strongly felt the need to say something since this movie is ranked as the second worst movie of all times. And its a pretty big compliment for a mediocre project like this. I had to call Birdemic a project, not a film, not on the merits of production quality but for the ambiguous intentions of the filmmaker.Its not fun, funny, cult or interestingly bad, its just rubbish. Big mistake someone decided to produce and distribute this piece of work. Filmmaker could be an attention seeking muppet or over-confident prick, but distributing, watching and helping others to watch this movie does not justify any of this.Also people should be warned that this movie is not what it seems to be: a mockery of Hitchcocks&#x27; Birds, a criticism to polished film making or a tribute to B-movies (such as often mentioned Manos: Hands of Fate, rightfully labelled as one of the worst movies of all times).Lets be clear, it is not one of the &#x27;too good because its too bad&#x27; movies. Its downright boring. Amateur acting, constant panning of dull locations in establishing shots, lazy SFX and mediocre script. If it were to be extremely bad (or obviously tried to be bad), we could have a laugh. But not even that happens. I wont argue individuals right to disagree, and there is a bunch of people who find this movie entertaining. Educational, cultural, social and economic backgrounds create great depths between IMDb users.However, the only thing that Birdemic got right is &#x27;the shock and terror&#x27;.. which came from the boredom and idiocy it creates. Its a total waste of time, and does not stand to the buzz it creates. Im giving a 3*, because it doesn&#x27;t deserve the lowest rating.Final words: you have been awarned! Do NOT watch this movie (unless you are forced to), at least not pay for it. And also, do not watch any movie from anyone associated with Birdemic.	2
Aahm. .. kind of ... sh.t.	Hungary	The storyline is quite good, the visual effects are awful. The eagles actually attacking the people around are actually images. They are not even lighted well. No consequences at all. Nonsense, this movie is just nonsense. Grammatical difficulties in the dialogs, illogical scene order. Even bad actors. Bad cut, bad after-work. If I can advise you something, please don&#x27;t crucify yourself with watching that film. However, if you watch through that all, you can say &#x27;I&#x27;ve just wasted my time to watch the two parts of Birdemic, yeah man! :) &#x27; Just walk your dog, cat, goldfish... something... I can assure you, You will not enjoy that film because of the failed special effects. Terrible. There&#x27;s a scene where the forest is burning... Lighting spots on trees, with gray lines (smoke). Very sad.	1
Why...Just...why?	None	This movie made the room look like a masterpiece its terrible acting, terrible set,awful cgi effects,and weird audio cuts during dialouge,I can&#x27;t find anything good to offer in this film,I actually procrastinated this review multiple times because i couldn&#x27;t finish the &#x22;movie&#x22;,atleast the room has a cult following,but not birdemic oh no this film has a following but its not at cult status thats how bad it is,not to mention the first hour out of the 1:31:10 running time of the film is nothing but pointless sequences that have nothing to do with the film and i swear they used a 8 mm camera to film this,for a 2010 release it has poor visual qualities and the audio OH GOD! the audio you can clearly hear the audio cuts when it alternates between the &#x22;actors&#x22; talking it&#x27;s choppy and gets very annoying after the first 30 seconds of the film,it has out of context music that makes a car ride look like a super fun adventure to the shire,and how come this apparently abandoned city has hundreds of cars passing by?,and I can&#x27;t stop thinking about how this movie exist at all,In conclusion This movie should be passed up unless you&#x27;re a fan of bad movies.	1
