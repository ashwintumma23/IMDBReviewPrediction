Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, dynamic duo.	Macedonia	They are two worst filmmakers in filming history. And they work together!!!!! Why? Whyyyy? They have written and directed films such as &#x22;Date Movie&#x22;, &#x22;Epic Movie&#x22;, &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22;, &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; and &#x22;Vampires Suck&#x22;. And they work together on &#x22;The Biggest Movie of All Time 3D&#x22;. It will be adventure/comedy. Right? It will be released in 2012. Wow. The Biggest Movie of All Time? And in 3D? Wow again.Sometimes I even like parodies. There are plenty great parodies out there. But this films are simply idiotic. I watched &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; till the end on. I knew it will be extremely stupid, but really I didn&#x27;t expected this.I was thinking: Finally!!! &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; will be disaster for their careers. They will try to made something else with their lives. But nooo... they did it again, and again.Please someone stop them. Or just shot them.	1
Not a Success	United States	If I could give this film zero out of 10 stars, I would have. In fact, even zero may be too generous. Problem 1: A successful movie, even a spoof or parody, needs to have an actual plot, and this one doesn&#x27;t. Problem 2: A successful movie cannot be made by stringing together 90 minutes of tired pop-culture references, lame celebrity impersonations, grotesque sexual innuendo, ridiculous sight gags, mindless profanity, and bad jokes. Problem 3: A successful movie needs more than the cheesiest acting since a 1970&#x27;s After-School Special, and the worst script since &#x22;Plan 9 From Outer Space.&#x22; Problem 4: Jokes you can see coming from a mile away only work if they are actually funny.	1
So Awful Its Not To Be Believed	Los Angeles, CA	It really takes a lot for me to hate a movie nowadays. Before I knew the true connotations of the word, I used to toss it around willy-nilly at any film I merely disliked. I&#x27;m even embarrassed by some of the films I used to say I hated. There have been very few films I&#x27;ve hated since I&#x27;ve graduated high school, because by that point I had learned to avoid wasting my father&#x27;s hard-earned dollars on Catwoman and Gigli. But then I walked into this mind- numbing monstrosity of a film that made me want to hurt things. Badly. I wanted to hurt the projectionist for even so much as showing the film, because by screening it that day, he made everybody in that theatre dumber and angrier. There is no plot in the film so to speak, and the jokes are stretched out for painfully long periods of time in order to compensate for the fact that without them, the film would be no more than a glorified television ad. It basically is a glorified television ad in its final form, but nothing more. The fact that people actually gave these untalented hacks money to make something that they probably knew wouldn&#x27;t be any good is proof that the world is going downhill. If there was any justice, the filmmakers would be tied up with piano wire, hurled off a cliff into a sea filled with rich BP oil, and keelhauled through a shredding machine. And all the world would lose would be two shitty movie makers.	1
One of the worst movies ever made by far.	United States	Although this movie is not the worst movie ever made, but it is sure as hell in the top 3! The storyline is DREADFUL! Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events. God, how terrible! This movie is a parody of all kind of different movies. But the director of this movie is the first one I have ever seen to make parody COMPLETELY SUCK! First of all this movie try to parody Hancock &#x26; Enchanted, WTF?! Weren&#x27;t those two films already parody&#x27;s? Or satires, what ever you want to call them. Are you a-holes really that desperate for things to make fun of that they resort to satirizing satires? The superheroes and parody of random people, literally appear out of no were, with no reason and no funny jokes or gags to say or do. The acting sucks, the effects suck, the plot sucks, and all in all this movie sucks! The only good thing is at least this movie isn&#x27;t Orgy of the Dead.	1
So bad, it makes you angry!	Washington DC, USA	There were actually a couple (count them - 2) slightly funny parts to this movie: The &#x22;Head-On&#x22; commercial spoof and the spoof of &#x22;Enchanted&#x22;. Unfortunately, they fall flat pretty quickly, and, like the rest of the movie, last way longer than they should. In fact, many of these scenes (Girl-Girl wrestling match, High School Musical skit, Miley Cyrus death, etc.) are uncomfortably long! I actually left during the Chipmunks scene, used the bathroom, made some tea, came back, and it was still going on!!!! I&#x27;m not kidding! Did someone really think it was funny enough to make a scene about fighting a rabid and foul-mouthed version of Alvin and the Chipmunks 15 minutes long. I was actually embarrassed for the actors that had to ham their way through. The acting was bad! The dialogue was horrible! The whole premise was BAD! This movie gives spoof movies an even worse name. Oh, how I long for the days of Airplane, Hotshots, and The Naked Gun. WHO KEEPS GIVING THESE GUYS MONEY TO MAKE THESE MOVIES????	1
OK, we get it already!!!!!	Australia	Remember the days when the words &#x22;movie spoof&#x22; would conjure up memories of laugh out load comedies such as &#x22;The Naked Gun&#x22;, &#x22;Airplane&#x22;, &#x22;Jane Austen&#x27;s Mafia&#x22; and &#x22;Hot Shot&#x22;? These were the movies that not only made us laugh but made us want to watch the films they lampooned over again. But these types of film can&#x27;t always guarantee to entertain us. Put in the hands of the wrong people you end up with forgettable disasters like &#x22;Silence of the Hams&#x22; and &#x22;Chicken Park&#x22; but in recent years Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have completely destroyed the genre for everyone with their tired, overused jokes, immature gross out &#x22;humour&#x22;, homophobic/racist/sexist stereotypes and their obsession with belittling celebrities and capitalizing on every major film of the year.But Disater Movie is Friedburg&#x27;s and Seltzer&#x27;s worst film yet (I say &#x22;yet&#x22; because, sadly they have more &#x22;ideas&#x22; for future parody films). Now, I confess, I have only seen the first half hour of this film, which I consider an achievement because even the opening scene caused me to be severe pain. I had low hopes for this film in the first place so I waited for it to air on TV to avoid paying to see this garbage. However, as low as my expectations were I found that they were still too far high.The opening scene in a pathetic 10,000 BC parody that targets Amy Winehouse. Now, I&#x27;m no fan of Winehouse but even I get angry when I see stuff like this making light of her drug and alcohol problem. Yes it easier to laugh at someone like this than it is to actually help them but this whole &#x22;joke&#x22; goes too far. But then Friedburg and Seltzer take a break from insulting Winehouse to insulting the viewer but having Winehouse letting out a long 30 second or so burp followed by a series of shorter burps which is supposed to make us say &#x22;Oh that is so clever. Every time I thought she was finished burping she let out another one. Oh Friedburg and Seltzer, you are truly comic geniuses&#x22; but instead we end up screaming out &#x22;OK, she burps. We get it already! ENOUGH!!!&#x22; Next we are treated to a party scene that lampoons &#x22;No Country for Old Men&#x22;, &#x22;Wanted&#x22; &#x22;High School Musical&#x22; &#x22;Juno&#x22; and &#x22;Superbad&#x22; (How these films could be considered disaster movies is beyond me), during which we see Carmen Electra playing the same character she has played in every other &#x22;Movie&#x22; film, a random wrestling scene that was supposed to be &#x22;sexy&#x22;, a few more attacks on celebrities, seemingly endless homophobic/racist/sexist jokes, gross out &#x22;humour&#x22; a musical number that makes the songs from &#x22;Grease 2&#x22; worthy of a Grammy in comparison and then, after a half hour of pointless, mindless drivel do we start to see the parodies of disaster films, which includes bikini-clad women for some reason, Hancock hitting his head on a lamppost, a cow landing on Ironman (characters hitting their head on or being crushed by something is used in every other Friedburg and Seltzer movie, and it wasn&#x27;t funny the first time either) and then Hannah Montana being crushed by a meteorite, in which we see a repeat on the Amy Winehouse burp scene only this time Hannah Montana dies, comes back to life to say something, dies, comes back to life to say something else, dies again and it just goes on like that...and that is when I stopped watching.After sitting through just half an hour of this rubbish I was left asking once more how Friedburg and Seltzer are able to continue making more of these films? Yes, they maybe wildly popular with immature teenagers but surely they must be losing the studio money? These movies offer nothing new, there is no real story structure, no character development, awful acting, jokes you can see coming a mile off which are dragged out and outstay their welcome (if they were welcomed in the first place) and 6 months down the track you can expect to see the DVD copy for 50 cents in a cheap shop or sold along with a more popular movie. Hell, if I was even offered this movie for free I&#x27;d consider that offer a rip off.So in closing the only thing I can say to Friedburg and Seltzer is &#x22;OK, WE GET IT!!! ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!	1
Stupidity Reigns	Australia	What is there to say about Disaster Movie. In one word: Pathetic. I rated it one star but really wanted to rate it half or even less. There is no editing team what so ever as the scenes go for way to long. From the intro with Amy, the extremely drawn out &#x27;curve the bullet&#x27; skit, the standard two girls fighting bit, (only good if you pause it)through to the end. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s called Disaster Movie as most of the things they so lamely attempt to spoof have nothing to do with that type of movie.I did watch the whole thing as I didn&#x27;t want to comment on it if I had not in case there was something funny at the end...silly, silly me. One thing i would love to know is how they got the budget to make such un-funny crap when the networks are canceling some shows that they think are not rating high enough.Granted some children might find it funny sometimes, but adults shouldn&#x27;t. The final question is &#x27;is there anything redeeming about this film&#x27;? Yes. It has an ending.	1
What a disaster....	The Grey Havens	Wow. &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22;, huh? Fitting title, plus they had a disaster script to match.Way to go. You&#x27;ve officially turned cinema into a spectator&#x27;s sport. Pathetic, and people actually go to see garbage like this! What is the future of cinema coming to? Please, do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY, FAR AWAY. It&#x27;s for your own good, trust me. Even I could have done better than this, and I don&#x27;t even know how to direct. But apparently, neither did these people. I wouldn&#x27;t even give this--thing--the honor of calling it a movie. I&#x27;ll stick with &#x27;thing&#x27;.1/10. If I could give a rating less than 0, I would. Maybe -10. Please, stick to the classics, like the Monty Python movies. THOSE are actually funny! Maybe the directors and writers of this film should open their eyes and stop writing things like this. Disgusting.	1
Unfunny, Annoying, and Abysmal	United States	Nothing in Disaster Movie works. The actors don&#x27;t even try, the jokes are the worst I have ever heard, the effects are painful to watch, the parodies are horrible, everything fails. The jokes are extremely unfunny, random at times, often don&#x27;t feel like they have punch lines, and they go forever. In a film that is less than an hour and a half the jokes should not all be a minute long. When a joke is told the film feels like you just hit pause. The film stops, tells the very long and terrible joke, and when it is over and the film moves on it just stops again for another bad joke just seconds later. The parodies are unfunny, random at times, and make me feel horrible. All the jokes in the film are either physical (unfunny) or parody (very unfunny). A parody is meant to make someone laugh about something they&#x27;ve seen. This makes parodies the wrong way. Instead of making fun and at the same time honoring the thing being parodied Disaster Movie does neither of those two things. It doesn&#x27;t honor anything. It doesn&#x27;t make fun of much. The parodies are just there. The parodies most of the time are just the character from another movie saying that they are that character and then the character gets hurt. This is due to the parodies being made from trailers of the movies. Friedberg and Seltzer give a bad name to parodies when there is a lot of good parodies. Now to due this and other films under the same two directors the parody genre should retire. In the end Disaster Movie is a true disaster.0 stars out of 4Also an MJ molesting joke in 2008. At the time MJ jokes hadn&#x27;t been considered funny for years. The was just failure to realize a change in humor.	1
there should be ratings going into the negative tens	United States	I didn&#x27;t get farther then 20 minutes into the movie. This film is an insult to my intelligence. I should sue the two idiotic film makers for extensive emotional damage. There&#x27;s a scene where they poke fun at a commerical that probably aired in whichever part of the country Freidberg and Seltzer were in at the time. The commercial didn&#x27;t air in other parts of the country, so I had to google the joke in the movie. for the love of god, if i had to google what a joke in a movie was making fun of, you just know the film is a fail so epic it overflows the integer of fail and wraps it right the hell around the universe.I am now stupider after seeing this movie.	1
