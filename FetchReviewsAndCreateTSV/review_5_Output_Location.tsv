The masterpiece without a message	Baltimore, MD	One of the early scenes in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and it&#39;s also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn&#39;t know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; wouldn&#39;t be &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.<br><br>It&#39;s no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you won&#39;t pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or &quot;art about art.&quot; It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I&#39;ve ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.<br><br>The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that it&#39;s essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantino&#39;s originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.<br><br>Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, &quot;Be cool and no one&#39;s going to get hurt,&quot; which is just the type of line you&#39;d find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines aren&#39;t just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mia&#39;s statement to Vincent, &quot;That&#39;s when you know you&#39;ve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.&quot;<br><br>What is the movie&#39;s purpose exactly? I&#39;m not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isn&#39;t just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because it&#39;s a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.<br><br>There&#39;s a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butch&#39;s act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but we&#39;re never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.<br><br>Still, it&#39;s hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really &quot;about&quot; anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn&#39;t need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind. 
Simply The Best	England	To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will. 
One of the best movies of the century!	Warsaw, Poland	 If you think &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many &quot;f&quot; words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is &quot;cool&quot;, he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece. 
Unbelievable.	Canada	Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it. 
The Movie that redefined a genre	Halifax, Canada	Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film. 
It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!	United States	 My oh my.  &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.  
Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece	Barcelona, Catalunya	 Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.<br><br>It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.<br><br>Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a &quot;tough guy&quot; image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.<br><br>The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. &quot;And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...&quot; is my favourite quote.<br><br>Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.  
One of the Best Films Ive Seen In A LONG Time... and still is	United States	Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? It&#x27;s filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that we&#x27;ve seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. <br><br>The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time you&#x27;re surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... I&#x27;ll leave to you. 
Awesome!	None	I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they weren&#x27;t sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.<br><br>First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didn&#x27;t think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930&#x27;s (even to my one fairly &#x22;hip&#x22; relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).<br><br>Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travolta&#x27;s pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jackson&#x27;s sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Willis&#x27;s deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters&#x27; personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years&#x27; experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.<br><br>Thus, and in response to some other reviewers&#x27; comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you can&#x27;t help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.<br><br>Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later film&#x27;s sleaze and violence.<br><br>In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990&#x27;s, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.<br><br>(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, don&#x27;t miss another 1990&#x27;s Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.) 
Tour de Force	Oregon, USA	That&#39;s what this 1994 film is, a tour de force cinematic expression by Quentin Tarantino. A film with which Tarantino staked his claim to the title of genuine Hollywood wunderkind, auteur, young genius, all ala Orson Welles. Pretty heady stuff.<br><br>By what means? First, with a snappy script with witty if not cerebral give-and-take dialog, written mainly by Tarantino himself. Then, by populating the cast with an intriguing hand-picked array of actors to deliver those well-written snappy lines. This film oozes inspired casting, of actors who either played against type or at least became offbeat and edgy in ways in which we hadn&#39;t hitherto known them. Then, through the editing process, by telling the story in a maximum non-linear way, out of time, reducing the film to a series of seeming disjointed non-sequential vignettes, each vignette featuring the aforementioned snappy dialog delivered by the aforementioned hand-picked edgy actors. It is only after watching the entirety of the movie, and reflecting back on it, does the gestalt emerge for the viewer. And, it may take more than one viewing to get there. Then, lastly, by topping it all off with a snazzy soundtrack. That&#39;s how. Add all that stuff together and you get Pulp Fiction.<br><br>The film received its share of acclaim, and deservedly so. But that said, while seen by most as a good film, Pulp Fiction is not regarded as another Citizen Kane, and Pulp Fiction is not ensconced in the pantheon of the greatest of the great Hollywood films of all time. Those are for a reason. As good a cinematic achievement as Pulp Fiction is, the fact is that as a film it plows turf that&#39;s just way too coarse for comfort. Over-the-top blood, guts, and brains-blown-out violence. Gritty gutter language. Subject matter dwelling in the underbelly of life that goes way beyond seedy or unseemly. And it&#39;s all presented in a very graphic way. Some people really like it that way. Hey, I understand. That&#39;s what Tarantino wanted too, right? But the simple fact is that such fare isn&#39;t for everyone. Period. In this way its own intentional and unrelenting coarse nature is what self-selects it out of the greatness category. To achieve greatest of the greats greatness it has to be seen that way across the board, amongst every audience. Pulp Fiction by Tarantino&#39;s design isn&#39;t intended to appeal to everyone.<br><br>And whither Tarantino? That&#39;s the real question. His career didn&#39;t actually begin with Pulp Fiction, what with the auspicious start he made a couple of years earlier with Reservoir Dogs (1992). And Pulp Fiction of course certainly wasn&#39;t his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol. I and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and ambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But let&#39;s be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more like Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasn&#39;t moved much beyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, he&#39;s still earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it too, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a measure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films in him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new directions, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways as a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus. Which isn&#39;t a terrible thing. Pulp Fiction is a remarkable movie. But, hey, we thought there&#39;d be more. 
The rebirth of a genre  and film history	wherever good films play	I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we&#x27;ve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines &#x96; it&#x27;s a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it&#x27;s just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there&#x27;s the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with &#x27;Pulp Fiction&#x27;. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of &#x22;chapters&#x22; &#x96; there is so much playful creativity at play here, it&#x27;s just a pure joy to watch.<br><br>If you&#x27;re a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats &#x96; and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even &#x22;stealing&#x22; from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino&#x27;s masterpiece today, it&#x27;s impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after &#x27;Pulp Fiction&#x27;. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it&#x27;s got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it&#x27;s such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It&#x27;s &#x96; well: it&#x27;s &#x27;Pulp Fiction&#x27;. 10 stars out of 10.<br><br>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br><br>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br><br>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/ 
The Most Overrated Film in Existence...	Latvia	Pulp Fiction is the quintessential 90&#x27;s crime film. Pulp Fiction changed the cinematic landscape when it was released, it broke new grounds in terms of screen writing and revived the career of John Travolta. And so on and so forth. In other words, Pulp Fiction is important film in the history in cinema, but it&#x27;s not the best film ever. <br><br>I have seen Pulp Fiction several times and after each time seeing it, I tend to enjoy it less. I saw it first time a few years ago and loved every second of it. But after seeing few hundred more films and especially grindhouse/exploitation films, Pulp Fiction starts to loose its charm. <br><br>Before I continue this thought, I should name the good stuff first. I loved every moment with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. They did a phenomenal job and elevated the already strong dialog. Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel were also great and so are the scene with Christopher Walken is still amazing. <br><br>But aside from the strong acting and great dialog, there isn&#x27;t a whole lot to Pulp Fiction. It&#x27;s just bunch of stories that happened in non- linear fashion. It&#x27;s all being hip and cool and saying clever dialog. There isn&#x27;t any complex characters like in Jackie Brown and it lacks the creative visuals of Django Unchained or the tension of Inglorious Basterds. I won&#x27;t deny that Pulp Fiction is very entertaining but there just isn&#x27;t enough substance or craftsmanship involved to endure multiple viewings.<br><br>Films like Apocalypse Now, Lady Vengeance, Taxi Driver, Clockwork Orange and many others, holds up much better after watching them multiple times. Those films can be enjoyed purely from the technical aspects and as well as the story and characters. Pulp Fiction is a popcorn film for those who enjoy dialog, cool characters and movie references. I like films with an emotional core, strong characters and impressive visuals. <br><br>Pulp Fiction is a film that most of the people have seen. If you haven&#x27;t then go watch it because it&#x27;s entertaining, very accessible 90&#x27;s crime film. To me Pulp Fiction feels dry and lacks the elements that draw me in films. 
Could Be Most Overrated Movie Of All Time	Bayside, San Andreas	Pulp Fiction is often considered the coolest and greatest film of all time. But, the people who usually say this are pretentious film snobs and people who think this is something extraordinary. Excuse me, it isn&#x27;t.<br><br>First of all the film has NO plot. If a film has no plot, then why should we care about the unlikeable characters? Second, the diagloue is so....BAD. Does the director think people actually talk like this, because, well they don&#x27;t.<br><br>Third, the grossly, glamorous violence, is disgusting. This isn&#x27;t a horror film, so why do we need such violence popping in and out of the movie? So, I urge everyone to avoid the hype of this pretentious, terrible mess. 
9 IMDb? Really?	Egypt	Sorry for the image, but if you take a bowl of crap, rearrange it, put some sugar and a little cherry on top, what to you get? ... a bowl of crap.<br><br>This is the most overrated film of all time. I&#x27;m even feeling strange to call it a film. It has no story, no feelings, no plot, no music - just 4 different scenes of disgusting, violent, abusive, offending and racist content put together in a mixed sequence.<br><br>How this crap scores a 9 on IMDb is beyond me. Sometimes when people see a 9 they automatically deceive themselves into believing this is a masterpiece and that maybe if they didn&#x27;t like it, something is wrong with their opinion or taste. Nothing&#x27;s wrong. It&#x27;s a bad movie from beginning to end. The problem is that sometimes Hollywood movies are over-hyped for business reasons like what happened in Titanic and Avatar which by the way were &#x22;OK&#x22; movies but didn&#x27;t deserve the huge credit they received.<br><br>I gave this a 1 because Samuel L. Jackson was the only thing interesting in this disaster. I&#x27;m not going to tell those of you that haven&#x27;t seen it not to, you have to go through the experience on your own and make your fare judgment. Don&#x27;t listen to anyone&#x27;s opinion - especially the ones that think if you love this one, then you&#x27;re COOL! 
Why Did People Like this?	New Haven, CT	 Why did people like this?<br><br>Tiresome streams of pop-culture references?(&quot;like kane in Kung Fu&quot; &quot;Elvis or Beatles? Brady Bunch or Hogan's Heroes? Buffy St. Marie or Dusty Springfield? Leo Sayer or Captain &amp; Taneall?&quot;)<br><br>mundane out of context dialogue?(&quot;wow this coffee sure is good. I didn't expect you to have such good coffee.  this is one mean cup of joe!&quot;)<br><br>Hip depictions of Drug Culture.?<br><br>It's annoying bellyflop into the middle of the retro craze fashion herd?<br><br>one dimensional characters pointing guns at each other's heads? (the cheapest, most half-assed, most cliched way to generate drama = person pointing gun at another person's head.  And yelling. over and over.)<br><br>&quot;cool&quot; sunglasses?<br><br>Take these things out, and the movie still isn't very good. Leave them in and it's trendy and annoying.<br><br>If you are a teenager and don't know anything about HK films, films from the 70s, or the 70s in general, are easily duped by hype, I urge you to see this movie. It was made for you!! It will TOTALLY BLOW YOU AWAY, MAN! Dude!<br><br> 
Too long, too boring with poor story development	None	It seems that Quentin Tarantino must have written this movie, by writing down some gross scenes he wants to play out and then almost as a jump-cut tries to string those scenes together. It doesn&#x27;t work, what does work are the big stars in the movie to bring people to watch it. They think, a collection of stars, so it must be a great movie. Sometimes it is, but this one isn&#x27;t.The dance scene was nothing special. People continue to believe that John Travolta is actually a dancer because of the movie Saturday Night Fever. He &#x22;played&#x22; a dance, which isn&#x27;t the same as being a dancer. He looked overweight and stiff in the dance scene of this movie, although this scene was promoted heavy when the movie first name out. Quentin Tarantino must have thought, that since Travolta played a dancer in another movie, we should have him dance. While Christopher Walken who in addition to being a fine actor is also a real dancer, doesn&#x27;t dance in this film, which is a shame. While Travolta was great in Get Shorty, this script isn&#x27;t a mature work. The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. It tries to conceal this fact by showing gross scenes which you get bored with seeing at the first sign of blood. The bad guys aren&#x27;t just bad, they are stupid. If crime is your business, and you intend to kill someone, just kill them, no sense in lecturing them. It isn&#x27;t like they are going to improve from this lecture. Maybe Quentin Tarantino wrote this script and then realized it didn&#x27;t have enough gross stuff, so he put more of it in. The shock value doesn&#x27;t last long. There are many characters in the story which could have developed into a wonderful story, showing the interplay and relationships between them all, which it could have easily done consider this bore is 2 and a half hours long, but they decided to go for the undergrad film school approach to long scenes which make you wish for a TV ad to break it up. Last and certainly not the least offensive of this movie, is how horrible music was used incorrectly. Nothing but songs tossed in which have nothing to do with anything. This shows he isn&#x27;t a mature filmmaker who knows what the power of music can do for films. Quentin Tarantino needs to watch more Hitchcock films for starters. Tarantino needs to study characters since all those in this film were pretty much one dimensional. The people who claim this is a master piece don&#x27;t know what a real master piece is. They have not studied films, they have not lived, and most of all, they don&#x27;t really think for themselves. The marketing of this film tells them it is hip, so they look at it to be hip. 
Flat and Brainless	United States	As a 13 year old just getting into cinema, this was the best film ever. How could I not be blown away by all the clever dialog, great characters, fantastic storyline, and gripping violence. It was just pure heaven. I saw this movie three times in the course of one year, and I still have such fond memories of watching it. It was around the time I got serious about cinema (about two years later) that I felt I needed to give this another go. I&#x27;d discovered the works of Bergman, Tarkovsky, Godard,etc, and felt a connection with film in ways I hadn&#x27;t before, and I wanted to see if the movies I loved before still held up. I had every intention of loving &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22; just as much as I did back then, but I didn&#x27;t. There was nothing there, no core. All the things I&#x27;d loved about it were gone. That clever dialog? Referential nonsense that gave no insight into who I was watching or attempted to expand the narrative. The great characters? Indistinctive cardboard cutouts that act as mouthpieces for Tarintino. Fantastic storyline? A pseudo throwback to film noir that can&#x27;t decide whether it wants to take itself seriously or be intentionally stupid for the sake of irony. Gripping violence? It&#x27;s violence that&#x27;s harsh enough to put the average viewer in awe, safe enough as to not offend.<br><br>It&#x27;s a dead film with no ideas. A common argument I hear in it&#x27;s favor is that it&#x27;s somehow objectively entertaining. Why? Because it has guys with guns and monologues about McDonalds? Sorry, but that&#x27;s not entertainment in my mind. Entertainment is being engaged, having to think. A film like &#x22;Andrei Rublev&#x22; is entertaining because, while I watch it, it evokes thought and feeling, it has something I can sink my teeth into. I can still think about it, interpret it in different ways. &#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22; is just shutting your brain off for two and half hours while a man with a God complex strokes his ego.<br><br>Basically, I can understand to some extent why it is so popular. It&#x27;s very good at pleasing the masses, something Tarkovsky could never do. It&#x27;s so perfectly designed to hook the average viewer in. But it&#x27;s paper thin. This is exactly what I don&#x27;t want in cinema 
Umm...?	United States	So there is a lot of hype surrounding Pulp Fiction. It won Original Screenplay. It was nominated for six other Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. I see it is given four out of four stars if it is on TV. It is also in IMDb&#x27;s Top 250. (But) what is the big deal about it? I was bored and disappointed. Pulp Fiction did not really make a whole lot of sense. I can not remember if it was nominated for editing or not. If they wanted to be in that category or have a better chance at winning then obviously more editing should have happened. I do not see the point of Vince and Mia&#x27;s date. All if not a lot of that should have been cut. Why drag on Bruce Willis being on the run from the mafia don? That took too long. Was the whole story about the watch necessary? Couldn&#x27;t Bruce and his woman just talk about it? Aside from being disappointing and boring Pulp Fiction was confusing. Bruce shoots John Travolta. And kills him. So how is he alive in The Bonnie Situation? Does Quentin Tarrantino not like editing too much? Well more editing could be needed a lot of times.(PF hint hint.) So yeah Pulp Fiction was boring, disappointing, confusing, etc. It should not have won Original Screenplay. It should have gone to someone else but if all five nominees were bad then it should have been none of them. Too much hype. Too much movie. Overrated. I can not remember much of this movie and happily so. So what is such the big deal? 
the most over valued film of the '90s	Rome, Italy	Pulp Fiction is one of those movies you feel uncomfortable to talk about in negative terms since mainstream loves it. The real killer of this movie are the dialogs supposedly so cool but instead being silly and irritating, from the very first scene when endless minutes are waisted talking about a frivolous argument. The violence in this film, rather strong, is very often disturbing but never fun or entertaining. Tarantino takes himself a little too seriously making the movie lose most of its ironical aspect. Unless you are a fan that goes wild for the overweight Travolta, you will find his so-called cult scenes dull and of no interest. All the characters in this movie are exaggerated, and that wouldn't be a bad thing, but they also are not fun. There are some good action scenes, very few, which anyhow will not save from failure a movie that lasts 2hrs 40min! 
blood and f****** spirituality	Virginia	 I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole &quot;Jules redemption-speech&quot; by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well. Tarantino alone uses an adolescent obsession with shallowness and morbidity to high satirical effect--like all great films (or even novels), this movie sets itself into a two-dimensional genre (absurd, pop-culture, comic-book situations) and then undermines its own genre by exposing the heart and soul underneath. There are too many points in the movie in which this happens to mention, but a few come to mind: the blown kiss from Vincent to Mia at the end of the first (or maybe second) story; the death of Vincent; the obvious emotional dedication of Butch to his wife at the end of his own story; Vincent's unwillingness to believe in his own supernatural salvation without realizing he's doomed; and, of course, the climactic speech. With the exception of Jules's final words, many of these moments seem at first to be horrifying or funny--but this is only because they fit so well into the flow of the script. A second glance shows them to be moments so poignant that the only reason they work is because they are so unique to the characters and their situations. The changes in each (or the lack of change) come, in a sense, as they individually choose to either drive for them or fall behind. Most die-hard fans of the movie, I'm sure, have heard the story of the briefcase and the band-aids on the back of Wallace's neck (the entire movie being a quest to bring back his stolen soul), and although Tarantino has denied it, he can't deny that the movie is full of such heroic themes: escape by trial, the reclamation of past, love as both physical salvation and personal security, a will to believe in something beyond one's own selfish world. I won't say that if you don't like this movie that you're mistaken or ignorant, but I think that Tarantino puts his audience into settings much like his characters are in: cheap, full of profanity and nastiness, fleeting. The best of them break through; I think he asks that anyone watching do the same.  
Unadulterated dreck	Wisconsin USA	 This is a great film? By what standards? Anyone can string together a bunch of violent, disjointed scenes, designed to shock and disturb the viewer. Violence, in and of itself, without context and pertinence to the story, is the tool of no-talent scoundrels masquerading as filmmakers. Such, unfortunately, is Tarantino. What a shame for Travolta that this was his 'comeback' film. For me, the only watchable part of this film was the sequence featuring Bruce Willis. Even that, though...how Willis was convinced to be in this film is a mystery to me. Cameos by Emil Sitka, Christopher Walken's brief part, and Harvey Keitel's appearance cannot save this self-indulgent and troubling example of a director gone wild, suffused with the sense of his own talent. This was a BOMB. 
Redemption? Spirituality? Yeah, Right.	Seattle, WA	 The comments for &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; generally fall into one of three categories: 1) &quot;Awesome Dude! The best movie ever!&quot; raves that offer zero supporting analysis, apparently written by Gen-Y homeboy wanna-bes raised on &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; sequels; 2) more considered, thoughtful raves praising the unconventional structure and 'hip' dialogue; 3) absolute horror that such violent, profane trash was ever made in the first place. I am much closer to #3 than the other two.<br><br>I had read about &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; (but not seen it) when &quot;Pulp&quot; was released. I went to see this with an open mind, before all the hype erupted. I almost walked out during the Gimp scene. I found this movie impossible to enjoy, because it seemed to revel in sadism, profanity, and cruelty, and I could find not one character to identify with. The whole film was simply unpleasant and repulsive - I just cannot find humor in graphic, casual murder. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and &quot;Seven&quot; are favorite films of mine, so I do not buy the 'go back to Mary Poppins' routine from many of the defenders of &quot;Pulp&quot;. I think the audience (and possibly Tarantino himself) simply gets off on seeing people like this go about their business - it is a vicarious thrill. I have known some lowlifes in the real world, and it is most decidedly NOT fun. What genuinely scares me about the overwhelming praise that &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; has received from critics and viewers is that there is zero empathy for the various victims of violence in this movie - they are regarded as mere props, not human beings.<br><br>***SPOILERS*** <br><br>One thing that has always bugged me, story-wise, is the scene in Butch's apartment with Vega. It makes no sense that a guy who is a professional killer would leave his weapon in plain sight, out of his reach, while he 'relieves himself'. I do not care how whacked out he is, in hostile territory he simply would never do that.<br><br>***END SPOILERS***<br><br>Everyone who praises Tarantino as the greatest filmmaker of a new generation - educate yourself a little about film. The overlapping storyline thing is nothing new (&quot;Rashomon&quot;), neither is using scatological monologues and non-stop profanity in place of actual dialogue (&quot;Scarface&quot;, for one). Let Tarantino write or direct something where the characters' primary means for self-expression is not gunfire, then we can talk. 
The worst movie I've ever seen	United States	I really find it difficult to believe this movie is rated highly by people. It's hands down the worst movie I've seen in my life (58 years). When my wife and I went to see it, soon after it came out, multiple people walked out of the theater saying either it was a terrible movie and/or it sickened them. Maybe all of us were just allergic to Tarantino's sick fascination with violence. The violence is just so gratuitous and casual as to make it seem like a bad video game. Outside of that, the overall movie has the feel of being viewed through the eyes of someone high on bad drugs. Please excuse my lack of specifics regarding the film, but I've fortunately blocked most of them from my memory. In any event, I worry about a society that thinks this is a good film, I really do. 
One-dimensional modernist pap (minor spoilers)	United States	 Is it possible that something so loathsome and awful could actually be adored and lauded by millions of people?  Is it only a matter of chance that some movies are loved and others hated, regardless of their content?  I hope this is true, because I cannot believe that there is actually anything good about the movie Pulp Fiction to lead any sane, reasoned, drug-free person to write the glowing comments that surround mine, much less the oodles of people who actually handed over their money to see this thing.<br><br>Why is this movie so bad, you ask?  Okay, I'll tell you, even though it's like pointing out why windows are transparent.  Starting with the script, I see no reason to be impressed by an assemblage of overly stylistic dialogue and flat, boring characters.  There is nothing amazing about two guys talking about French McDonald's restaurants, and then killing some guys. Every awful stretch of dialogue is dragged out as long as it will last, and then some.  It's as if Tarantino said to himself &quot;I think I can cram one more line about milkshakes in here&quot;.  You have to give him credit for padding the film in ways that nobody's ever tried before.  The actors look as though they're doing their best to salvage this turkey (and they are talented), all the while knowing in the back of their minds how much of a cow pie the whole thing is.  As far as Tarantino's directorial style is concerned, he should just get himself a career in Nike commercials because that's where his talent level cuts off. 
Enormously Overrated	Backwoods Canada	The proof of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The proof of the movie is in the watching. Most of the top 250 IMDb movies have kept me glued to my seat--with this one I found my mind wandering to that jigsaw puzzle I hadn&#39;t finished or the possibility of some popcorn. I found I had very little interest in the characters or in what was going on.<br><br>I asked myself why. Technically the film is very good. The actors all hit their marks and Samuel L. Jackson is particularly outstanding. I liked Maria de Madeiros also as Bruce Willis&#39; wife Fabienne. The camera work is occasionally interesting, as the long scene where we watch Bruce Willis listen unemotionally to Marsellus go on. Interesting, certainly, but rather pointless.<br><br>Indeed, that&#39;s the problem: so much of what goes on is pointless. It&#39;s a big long shaggy dog story, told by one of those irritating people who can&#39;t get the story straight and have to keep going back: &quot;Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you about that. Well, you know what I was telling you before . . .&quot; I tried to find some justification for the higgledy-piggledy way in which this story is told. It does result in the best scene being the last one. But if this scene was the point then why not design the script so that the action is seen to be moving toward this goal and cut out everything that happens afterward? In the end I don&#39;t think Tarentino knew what story he was telling and that&#39;s why so much is so pointless.<br><br>The scenes of Butch attempting to control his temper, of his dilemma whether to help Marsellus, and the final scene in the restaurant are all good and entertaining as far as they go but they don&#39;t fall into a coherent framework. And the rest is quite dull.<br><br>The dialogue is not witty or clever although it occasionally has its moments. The constant profanity is as pointless as the rest; the point of profanity is presumably to emphasize what one is saying, but if everything is emphasized, nothing is. The mind becomes numbed by it. It&#39;s like someone who shouts all the time. Eventually you stop listening. The quotes give you a pretty good idea of what the dialogue is like: when &quot;Shut the f*ck up, fat man!&quot; is listed as a memorable quote, you know how inane the conversation is.<br><br>That this poorly composed script should have won an Oscar is a pretty clear indictment of the Academy. 
Hands down, the best film of the '90s.	south carolina	Pulp Fiction, despite borrowing from just about every movie ever made, is the most invigorating cinema experience a filmgoer can ever hope for. Its hodgepodge of violence, mayhem, and generally deviant behavior is an assault on the senses, not to mention political correctness. However, despite all the film's cleverness and style, it hinges on the performance put forth by Samuel L. Jackson as Jules. The fact that he was denied an Oscar is a downright shame. Martin Landau, the best supporting actor winner that year, was terrific and funny in Ed Wood, but Jackson was perhaps the most commanding screen presence in film history as the bible-quoting, godfearing hitman. The last scene in the coffee shop with Tim Roth still sends chills down my spine, no matter how many times I've seen it. Rumors of a prequel involving Jules and Vincent (John Travolta) have been floating around lately. If Quentin Tarantino wishes to regain the fans he lost with the dissapointing (but still pretty good) Jackie Brown, he should get to work right away. I'll be the first in line to see the finished product.  
A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.	Toronto, Ontario, Canada	There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called &quot;style&quot;. There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve.<br><br>Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesn&#39;t necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldn&#39;t wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines).<br><br>The strangest thing is, while the characters are &quot;in character&quot;, as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. There&#39;s really only a decent short film in all of this.<br><br>The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesn&#39;t connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing.<br><br>Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70&#39;s music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there.<br><br>While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because he&#39;s alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesn&#39;t have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roth&#39;s character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler.<br><br>As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. 
Good Yet Over-rated	United States	Quentin Tarantino is a good director who has a knack for combining wildly imaginative music selections for his movies that seem to work so well you have to laugh with joy.<br><br>He also is known for dark comedy, combining unexpected twists that dismay audience members to the point they often refer to him as a &#x22;genius&#x22;.<br><br>The problem with &#x22;genius&#x22; is that what is genius to some is mundane to others. <br><br>Tarantino is also known for his plot twists. However the excessive focus on plot twists creates an expectation from the audience, which opposes the basic appeal: the element of surprise.<br><br>In Pulp Fiction, twists are introduced with little finesse. Tarantino has improved with the years, but Pulp Fiction, an early film, becomes boring before it is over.<br><br>Certainly worth watching, but early and raw compared to Tarantino&#x27;s later films. 
Didnt like it at all! its just me, I guess...	Greece	I have watched 75% percent of this film twice: the first time, I watched it on TV, and about 3 quarters of the way, I gave up... However, due to the film&#x27;s cult following, I gave it another shot (and watched it to the end) and, to be honest, I didn&#x27;t like it anymore than I did the first time I watched it...<br><br>Why is that?<br><br>First of all, it was utterly chaotic for the most part. It felt like those experimental, amateur films, which I personally didn&#x27;t like at all...<br><br>Then there were the conversations within the film: as always with Tarantino&#x27;s films, obscenely profane and crude, plus they get nowhere...<br><br>Moreover, I found it over the top violent. Obviously, the storyline wouldn&#x27;t be the same without all the violence, but at times I found it to be overdone on that department...<br><br>Lastly, I found the script to be utterly appalling, in true Tarantino fashion, and nonsensical at parts...<br><br>I only liked one thing about Pulp Fiction: the acting. Everyone did their best and in the end, wasn&#x27;t the actors that disappointed me, but the film&#x27;s script...<br><br>So, the verdict:<br><br>It might be that I dislike everything that involves Quentin Tarantino, (his signature obscene violence and cruelly long, pointless and crude conversations have always appalled me) but I cannot give this film more than a 3 out of 10. For me it was painful to watch, only to reach a disappointing ending. Utter loss of time! But then again, it seems I&#x27;m one of few here on IMDb that disliked Pulp Fiction... 
One of My Favorite Movies Ever	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	The hit-men Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) work for the powerful mobster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames). Vincent has lived in Amsterdam for three years and is assigned with Jules to retrieve a suitcase that belongs to their boss. There is a shootout and Vincent and Jules do not die because the shots of one gangster fails the target. Jules believes that God&#x27;s hand has interfered in the bullets and he decides to redeem himself from his life of gangster. Vincent is assigned by Marsellus to go out with his wife Mia (Uma Thurman)while he is traveling and he is scared when she has an OD. Marsellus pays the boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) to lose his fight on the fifth round, but Butch wins the fight. He flees from Marsellus and his gangsters but his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) forgets to bring his golden watch that belongs to his family for many generations. Butch returns to his apartment and he faces Vincent first and Marsellus later. But an incident with sadistic perverts brings Marsellus and Butch side by side. <br><br>&#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22; is one of my favorite movies ever. I had seen this movie for the last time on 11 January 2002 and today I have just watched it again. When we compare the nominations for Best Picture in the 1995 Oscar (&#x22;Pulp Fiction&#x22;, &#x22;The Shawshank Redemption&#x22; and the winner and weakest &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22;) with the movies nominated this year we can see that the Oscar winners are not necessarily the best movies of the cinema history. &#x22;Pump Fiction&#x22; saved the career of John Travolta that was in the ostracism and put on the spot Quentin Tarantino after the cult &#x22;Reservoir Dogs&#x22;. The complex screenplay with four entwined story has shown to the world the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino. My vote is ten.<br><br>Title (Brazil): &#x22;Pulp Fiction &#x96; Tempo de Viol&#xEA;ncia&#x22; (&#x22;Pulp Fiction: Time of Violence&#x22;) 
The worst Movie ive ever seen in my life.	United States	Absolutely no idea why this film is so popular. I was bored out of my mind from the first scene to the last waiting patiently for a twist of some sort to tie the multiple stories together, which never happened. Probably my least favorite movie i&#x27;ve ever watched. The acting wasn&#x27;t bad and the film did tie in some aspects of popular culture and previous films, but if the viewer doesn&#x27;t give a crap about any of the characters whatsoever, or the plot(if you could call it that), then whats the point. I gained nothing from watching this movie besides an intense feeling of emptiness that usually comes after wasting 150 or so minutes of your life watching a pathetic piece of crap film about nothing. Was I at the edge of my seat, yes, however It wasn&#x27;t because of the suspense, I couldn&#x27;t keep my head from falling forward or my eyes open. And the way that the scenes were arranged, terrible. The movie memento is hard to follow sometimes and slightly dull at some points but at least there was a freaking point in the way the scenes were arranged, considering the main character had memory problems. In this movie, there was no reason for the random mix up of the scenes, except to just do something different and make a movie so weird and disgusting the critics think its a masterpiece. I usually like movies that are critically acclaimed, like The Godfather, one of my favorite movies, but Pulp Fiction isn&#x27;t even in the ball park. There isn&#x27;t the dark complex characters like in the godfather, just a bunch of rambling idiots tripping over their stupidity. 
Terrible	United Kingdom	This movie is definitely the most overrated piece of sh*t ever.<br><br>No story, no plot, no message, just Tarantino so totally in love with his own &#x22;witty&#x22; dialogue.<br><br>The movie is empty in every sense of the word. In addition, it&#x27;s also horribly boring and therefore ridiculously hard to watch. I always try to sit through every movie I start, but damn, with this one it was a hard task not to simply get up and walk away.<br><br>Pulp Fiction does not deserve to be on top of IMDb&#x27;s list of best rated movies with actual masterpieces like &#x22;The Shawshank Revenge&#x22;. The latter is a work of art, Pulp Fiction is merely a piece of sh*t dressed up as one and it&#x27;s amazing how many people fall for it. 
Boring	United Kingdom	Boring. Rubbish Film as per most of Tarantino&#x27;s stuff. The only good film Tarantino ever directed was the first half of &#x27;Dusk till Dawn&#x27;. &#x27;True Romance&#x27; was good as well,though he didn&#x27;t direct it. It was also let down somewhat by Tarantino&#x27;s poor dialogue (see Patricia Arquette&#x27;s speech where she reveals she&#x27;s a call girl. Appalling dialogue. Very Tarantino.) I recommend you spend you time better by watching all the films he&#x27;s paid homage to (ripped off) such as &#x27;Vanishing Point&#x27;, &#x27;Death rides a horse&#x27;, &#x27;the Baby Cart series&#x27;, The original &#x27;Inglorious Bastards&#x27; etc Tarantino and his rehashing of films which have passed out of the collective conscious is pretty unpleasant and not clever. The whole point of taking influence from other people&#x27;s work is to then create something of your own which is greater than the sum of its part. This Tarantino fails to do repeatedly. 
no substance	None	The 90s sucked. It was one of the major eras of entitlement, and dagnummit, Quentin Tarantino was ENTITLED to the stylistic gimmicks he absorbed from French new wave, 70s exploitation and martial arts films. He was entitled to use every character as a mouthpiece for his preciously quirky, offbeat voice. He was entitled to that word that makes Spike Lee mad when white people use it. He was entitled to co-opt obnoxious heroin- chic, &#x22;hip&#x22; retro-fauxhemian fashion trends. Tarantino&#x27;s movies echo the problem with Modernism: okay, you think the status quo is Bad, but if what you do is just a kneejerk reaction to that status quo with no values, ethos or any sort of moral core, how can you be sure the result won&#x27;t also be Bad? In fact, chances are it will probably be Worse! Right? Nonsense. The emperor doesn&#x27;t appear to have clothes, but that&#x27;s just because only the most profound, virtuous people can see them. You want to be part of that group, right...? 
People Acting Stupid	Terra	 *********Spoiler Warning**********<br><br>When this movie came out a lot of people I knew were making a big deal about it because it was made by a guy from Knoxville who even talked about K-town in the movie---and guess where I lived at the time?  Most people overlooked that Tarantino was only born there and lived most of his life somewhere else, and both Tarantino and Knoxville are highly overrated.  Trust me.<br><br>I can't see why this movie is regarded as highly as it is; it seems the key to Tarantino's storytelling is to mix together story elements kind of like a blender.  So we get things like the cab driver who's a sexy latin woman who'd look more at home in a luxury restaurant than a grungy cab, or the very seventies looking Samuel L. Jackson running around with the nineties looking John Travolta.  The result is the average person goes &quot;that's kind of strange,&quot; while the intelligentsia go &quot;yes, the man is a GENIUS!&quot;<br><br>I put off seeing this movie for several years because of the supposed extreme violence and the notorious rape scene.  When I finally broke down and watched it I was surprised how tame it was, even the rape scene was mostly people shouting behind a closed door.  It was nowhere near as scary or unnerving as the one in &quot;Deliverance.&quot;  In the end the violence was mainly psychological or limited, although the guy getting shot in the car and bits of you-know getting everywhere was a real turn-off.<br><br>But really what did the movie in for me was the plot, or lack thereof. Supposedly we're getting an homage to film noir and hardboiled fiction novels of the forties, done up in a modern story theme.  What we see on the screen is a confused mess of people running around and doing the most stupid things.  It's not a horrid movie, but there's a lot better ways to spend a few hours.  
Overrated  C R A P	Norway	Yes, that&#39;s right. Crap. This film is just that. If you take a closer look at f.ex. Bruce Willis, who seems to make people scream their head off every time he&#39;s near the screen, you can clearly see that this person lacks personality. He has two expressions: One that says ON, (with a little wrinkle above his nose) the other is of course OFF, when he&#39;s asleep. a machine of a man, which perhaps cries a bit when he comes home, because he&#39;s in desperate need for a personality, some feelings, a higher IQ and an even bigger paycheck.<br><br>Why this person has become so popular has to do with you mindless people out there. Voting, cheering and stamping your feet for talentless and retarded actors, musicians, artists etc. That is why this world goes straight down the toilette. Making your modern remarks that everything is so &quot;Cool&quot; all the time.<br><br>Pulp Fiction is at best a bad joke from a below average director. There is no inventions, no good or natural acting, no deeper meaning with this movie at all. Just exploitation.<br><br>The era of good movie-productions are long gone. Classic actor&#39;s like Chaplin, Bogart, Cooper, Peck, Holden and Quinn don&#39;t get born any more. Today it&#39;s just you gray and unpersonalized people out there (With some exceptions), watching to see if there&#39;s something that can kill your brain even more, with splatter and gore above your ears. Yeah, you&#39;re a really &quot;cool&quot; bunch, drowning on dry land. 
Totally underwhelmed	Manchester, England	This is, in my opinion, the most over-rated film of all time. Sure, there is some snappy dialogue here and there, and Tarantino has a good ear for music, but none of this warrants the gushing praise heaped upon this movie, nor the godlike status bestowed upon Tarantino himself.<br><br>It's over-stylised, over-loud, over-acted, (sorry Samuel, Tim, John, Uma &amp; Bruce) and the non-linear narrative so favoured by the director simply doesn't work.<br><br>But it's fashionable, so it's popular.<br><br>By the way, this is one of the few films where I've actually seen people get up and walk out of the cinema before the end, so I guess I'm not the only one who didn't like it. 
I'm afraid it's no good what-so-ever.	Croatia	What is it with this film? What IS IT!?!? Gangsters walking and saying absolutely nothing. A lot of idle and boring dialogue. Boring stories. Clich&eacute;d camera angles and borrowed materials from other films. And a whole lotta f-words to fill a space-cruiser. Some acting is good, but that's the actor for you...<br><br>Everything else is empty, empty, empty... Peer-pressure and the moronic masses of people say this film is &quot;a masterpiece!&quot; How? Because they talk about Quater Pounders with Cheese? Because of the &quot;morale&quot; of the gangster? What morale? &quot;We cool?&quot; &quot;We cool.&quot; Yeah those phrases have absolute impact...ooh hoo, bobby!<br><br>Yeah this is &quot;the movie that re-defined cinema&quot;... without re-defining it at all.<br><br>Skip this trash and watch something else... for the love of movies,please do that! 
A creative and slick waste of time	United States	You want to do something really neat? Take the movie &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; and re-cut it, so that, instead of being out of sequence, it is actually in proper sequence. It can be done. Why do this? Because if you do, you will see what a nothing movie this really is. There is no central plot, there is no real theme, or story or climax. It is just a bunch of tricks and overly snappy dialog, masquerading a piece of fluff that has as much depth as the kiddie pool. Hey, more power to Tarantino, the guy is a Houdini, full of slight of hand. But are we really so simple, that we are ranking this one of the ten greatest movies ever made? Come on! OK, I know that Travolta is cool and Jackson is funny. However, let's reserve the greatest films of all-time category for real masterpieces and real stories, and not some overly slick pulp geared towards video store geeks. 
The most ludicrously inflated reputation of any film	Eel Pie Island	The hugely overrated trivial chatting, the grotesque violence, the moral vacuum, the deadly slowness, the length --- about an hour too long --- make it incomprehensible today how this picture ever made people rave the way they did on this board.<br><br>The greatest film ever? Excuse me, this is a feature film that says nothing, depicts no authentic feelings or character development, is grossly self-indulgent and filled with idiotically implausible situations, such as people firing powerful handguns repeatedly, simultaneously and then hanging around chatting as if nobody would ever report the firing and summon the law.<br><br>Perhaps the most implausible character of all is played by Mr Tarantino, who shouts at the two hoodlum killers as if they were playmates from school and complains that his wife will divorce him if she returns from work to find a car in the garage containing a man with his head blown off.<br><br>Where is the moral compass of the people who revere this schoolboy nonsense? Nobody in the film is remotely principled, and nor is anyone (except possibly the pawnbroker) actually evil. The scene where he releases a leather-studded sadist from a cage is possibly the most unbelievable rubbish ever deployed in a Hollywood feature.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s only entertainment,&quot; I hear people protest. Well the difference between Mr Tarantino and film-makers of stature is that they are capable of entertaining while instructing, and of integrating the two. 
The most overrated and unimportant film of the century	The Greater Southwest	 It is neat to believe in your heart that you are hip. And if you can obtain coolness by watching a movie, wow! I believe that everybody who says they like Pulp Fiction thinks they are cool. They think that a movie with such style and witty banter is only for the hip. The only problem is that this film is as empty as a Scottish pay toilet and perhaps the most pretensious piece of nothing ever. If you have not figured it out yet, there is no story here. Tarantino simply shoots a pointless movie and then breaks it up so that we do not see it in its proper sequence. So things that happen last come before things that finished before and vice versa. You start to wonder, gee, am I not intelligent enough to follow this? Then you realize, uhhh, no, it is actually fairly simple. He is just stringing a bunch of scenes along in no particular order. Then he gives unrealistic and long-winded speeches to characters that are not particularly realistic. It does not make the film really bad, but at the same time, it does not make it good either. You can paint a piece of crap all kinds of different colors, but it is still a piece of crap. I wonder if Tarantino has the talent to actually tell a real story without having to resort to fancy tricks, shocking scenes and other gimmicky tricks. I doubt it. Oh well, I guess I am just not that cool. I mean, Samuel Jackson sure did say some funny things. 
What a great but useless attempt........	India	Pulp Fiction is a movie all credited to its director....Mr. Q. T. This movie is such an amazing and fast track of events all tied up nicely and cohesively that one can&#x27;t deny its grandeur.<br><br>But here comes the boom. It is a highly un-required movie that is overrated just due to its above mentioned qualities. But when something is made there must be a purpose behind its existence but the film is so useless and itchy that in my opinion this film is not the best film in history of cinema. Yes the film has a huge potential to influence movie making and direction but it itself is nothing but a crap of laughable and senseless events.<br><br>So to mention Sir i am not buying any of this movie but lets just consider the direction and cohesion of events. 
Crazyness all over the board	United States	for starters I could kind of tell that this was a Quentin Tarantino movie because all his movies seem to be dramatic or I guess you could say realistic and bold. This is a harsh story about drugs, robberies, and just overall mischief. Vincent Vega played by John Travolta was involved in a robbery of a diner right as the movie began. Making himself seem like an upstanding young man he is also heavily involved with heroin and mob like activity. Things get strange when he is asked by his mobster boss, Marsellus Wallace, to escort his wife, Mrs. Mia Wallace, while he is out of town. It seems like a recipe for disaster however not in the way one would normally think. The two did not hook up but Mia was in a deadly situation when she mistook Vince&#x27;s heroin for cocaine and snorted it and overdosing. When Vince finds her he takes her to Lance&#x27;s house where he normally buys his drugs and gives Mia an adrenalin shot to her heart. That situation could have been messy if they had screwed up in any way. Overall I thought this was a good movie although sometimes hard to follow. The harsh truth to it all gives it the essence of a Quentin Tarantino film. 
A few interesting moments but no classic	Stockport, England	I&#x27;ve never really understood the love for this film. There are some good actors in it (Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Harvey Keitel), there are some mediocre actors in it (John Travolta, Uma Thurman), there are some very funny moments and the different stories colliding is an interesting idea. However all the characters are two dimensional and when Tarantino himself appears it becomes apparent that the characters are all him really: limited in imagination, mouthy, insecure and angry. Really I&#x27;ve seen 30 minutes TV episodes with more depth and characterization. There are some laughs and genuine suspense but none of it really leads anywhere. Any time a character begins to say anything interesting another character has a sudden attack of tourettes and it&#x27;s brushed over quickly. It irritates me that one of the main characters dies halfway through but features in the rest of the film because it&#x27;s shown in a silly order. It&#x27;s a bleak world-view and it&#x27;s not one I share. I&#x27;d say this is an above average film but only just. 
nothing but a bullshit art-house stuff	None	i watched the film 20 years later since it&#x27;s making and attain 0% satisfaction of viewing pleasure considering it&#x27;s 5h top position on IMDb. The movie is an experimental art house crap that chooses no destination and lack brilliant, appealing sketching of it&#x27;s theme. The dialogues are the heartbeat of the film that lose it&#x27;s rhythm every moment when stretching same words to make viewers understood the characters&#x27;s stand, view in perplexing crime world and how they perceive.<br><br>The one thing, the film depressingly is in desire of clapping is Bruce Willis part of a boxer, who is feared but not a coward. The rare male protagonist with conscience.<br><br>Uma Thurman leaves a desire to see her complicated struggle with drug, lust and hunger to live free.<br><br>Tarantino has tried to harvest a violent creativity, but the offspring emits extragalactic passion that fail to make any beauty.<br><br>I have watched it and guarantee You waste of time 
Pretty bad!	None	The story development is very poor, and has very long dragged scenes that add nothing to the story. The non-linear and looping time order of the scenes smacks of an effort to cover up the lack of coherence in plot and character. The movie is like several episodes of a TV show thrown together.<br><br>Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who&#x27;s afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities. <br><br>The actors are doing a fine job with the crap they are given. However the distinct lack of a coherent plot, the disjointedly interwoven and half-baked story lines, the absence of characterization and incorrectly using of the music, makes this movie a good example of bad Cinema! 
Random scenes	None	The movie is as bad. If Aleksandr Nevsky directed it it would be very very wonderful. YOur Tarantino is no talent he is in a shadow of Aleksandr Nevsky. His movies are not badass nor funny. Aleksnadr Nevsky&#x27;s movies are actiony good sotry and good jokes. the movie has not script it was directed on the go. Tarantino no scirpt means bad business. I thought the movie is gonna be as beautiful as Treasure Hunters by Aleksandr Nevksy but it is no. No no no just very really no. Avoid your spending time of life on this garbage go and watch Aleksandr Nevsky&#x27;s movies. They are very underrated. Pulp fiction is overrated because Tarantino is no Aleksandr NEvsky. I know good you know bad. 
Violence and Redemption Underscore Pulp Fiction	United States	&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; is considered Quentin Tarantino&#39; masterpiece; both as a writer and director. Although it&#39;s not a perfect film and has a couple flaws, &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; has one of the greatest scripts that changed the way films were made. The film opens with a conversation between &quot;Pumpkin&quot; and &quot;Honey Bunny&quot; as they chat about their new plans to rob restaurants instead of banks and liquor stores. Eventually this scene will end the film as it doubles back on itself. Often times- and we&#39;re seeing the case more and more with Tarantino- he&#39;ll drive a film on dialogue instead of plot and substitute plot for senseless dialogue. That happens here, but it works most of the time. Lately it hasn&#39;t been working on the level of &quot;Pulp Fiction.&quot; <br><br>Uma Thurman plays Marcellus Wallace&#39;s (Ving Rhames) wife, Mia, and her only importance to film is to be entertained by Vincent Vega (John Travolta) on a date that&#39;s not quite a date. I feel as if these scenes are supposed to entertain us since it has nothing to do with the plot that is extremely thin compared to its run time (154 minutes). Travolta, for me, is the real stand out. When he&#39;s on screen his scenes, whether Jackson is next to him or not, are full of energy and pulp. He does a lot of listening, some dancing, a lot of arguing and/or debating, and offers up a lot of great comedic moments. His best scenes are with Uma Thurman when they go to Jackrabbit Slims. This little date, where they talk about nothing of much importance as far plot is concerned, is funny, engrossing and entertaining. I don&#39;t know why it never gets old, but it doesn&#39;t. The acting between the two is great and both were worthy of their Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress respectively. This section of the film is one of the strongest of the three along with &quot;The Bonnie Situation.&quot; The writing and acting is superb in both sections. This date leads to an overdose as Mia takes a line of Vincent&#39;s heroine. The direction here is much in the mold of a graphic Hitchcock film. To add to the suspense the owner of the house counts to three (Something that happens quite a bit in the film). As he slowly counts to three we see all the nervously waiting faces in the entire room. We get a close-up shot on the needle that&#39;s cocked back and ready to strike. We get a close-up on the red dot where the needle needs to hit. It slowly builds the scene and the suspense. Tarantino handles this scene and all the others with a ton of precision and a lot of confidence. <br><br>Tarantino makes huge strides as a director since his previous film, &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; and a lot has to do with his confidence as a director. The older Tarantino is too confident in his abilities. The majority of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; has a lot of energy and snap to it. If you watch closely to the opening scene in &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; you won&#39;t see that same kind of crisp, confident direction from Tarantino. There are a lot of pauses throughout that conversation and it doesn&#39;t quite flow like a Tarantino film that we&#39;ve become used to. To his credit he was working with some B-list (Some C or D-list) actors. He&#39;s not working with much more here, but the majority of his major role players are all acted out terrifically with the exception of one: Bruce Willis- through not fault of Tarantino; Bruce is just a bad actor. <br><br>The section of the film that really drags, and is noticeably behind compared to the other two sections, is &quot;The Gold Watch&quot; section. This section is incapable of greatness since Bruce Willis single handedly ruins it with his &quot;Die Hard&quot; facial expressions, especially when they&#39;re not needed. The writing here is also the worst and, at times, puts the actors in very difficult situations. This section becomes annoying as we hear Bruce Willis call his girlfriend- that we won&#39;t care at all about- Lemon Pie, Sugar Pie, and retard. When he calls her a retard it&#39;s pretty funny, but other than that this lacks the punch that Travolta and Thurman provided minutes earlier. This section is bloated with dialogue, bad acting, and uninteresting characters. &quot;The Gold Watch&quot; has its moments and definitely picks up when we meet the gimp and the crazy world that we fall into. It just takes too long getting there. Christopher Walken provides a very interesting and hilarious story of the watch that has been passed down anally from generation to generation of the Coolidge family. <br><br>&quot;The Bonnie Situation&quot; may very well be the strongest section of the film. This is where we meet &quot;The Wolf&quot; (Harvey Keitel) as he cleans up a mess made by Vincent Vega in a hilarious scene where he accidentally &quot;shot Marvin the face.&quot; &quot;The Bonnie Situation&quot; offers up quite a bit of laughs, some great acting, and a very strong ending. The film ends where it started with Jules (Jackson) talking about changing his life around as he &quot;walks the earth.&quot; Thankfully Gods interventionist-like hand, that saved him hours earlier, doesn&#39;t make him walk too far as He has sent him a weak person for the transitional Jules to save. The film ends on Jules changing or turning against everything he has ever done or known. Instead of being a bad - and killing &quot;Pumpkin&quot; (Tim Roth), he gives him some money, out of his own wallet, for a chance to start fresh and redeem himself. This might actually be &quot;Pumpkin&quot; and &quot;Honey Bunny&#39;s&quot; last heist, and they have Jules to thank for the chance at redemption and changing their ways. 
Not very original	Long Beach, CA	 It seems to me that much of the stylistic elements of the movie were taken from the 1955 film Kiss Me Deadly.  Kiss Me Deadly was full of quirky characters and had a mysterious chest which contained a glowing object.  The main difference in style was that the humor in Kiss Me Deadly is much more subtle, while Pulp Fiction is trying real hard to get a laugh or a reaction. Because of that, I feel that Kiss Me Deadly is the far superior of the two. 
A groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking	Portugal	What can I say about Pulp Fiction that hasn&#x27;t already been said before? That it is arguably one of the best movies ever made and that after twenty years since its release remains a dazzling and original piece of brilliant filmmaking? Well, of course I could say all that, but I still wouldn&#x27;t be making this magnificent movie justice. There&#x27;s the amazing screenplay, exploding with pop culture references, and whose merits raise far above its plot and are really more related to the brilliant character development and the awesome mix of comedy and tragic that are so beautifully brought to life by the awesome cast. And then of course there&#x27;s everything else, the amazing direction, the superb editing and the even more superb soundtrack. Tarantino has this ability to select an handful of songs that, far more than just cool and nice sounding (ala &#x22;Goodfelas&#x22; or &#x22;Boogie Nights&#x22;, for instance) manage to give meaning to the scenes in which they are played. And that&#x27;s just one of the million things that makes this movie so special and above all with such an high rewatchability value. And among those things there&#x27;s also of course the unlikelihood of everything we see happening on screen and the unfolding of events that makes glued to the screen even after dozens of views... Summing up my thoughts, Pulp Fiction is a groundbreaking achievement in filmmaking that still manages to dazzle and surprise audiences after 20 years of its release. It&#x27;s not just one of my favorite movies, it&#x27;s also the movie that made me look at films from a different point of view, almost &#x22;forcing&#x22; me to love them as much as I love books. Please, if you haven&#x27;t watched it yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it. But get ready, cus&#x27; it&#x27;s gonna be a bumpy ride!
