They are two worst filmmakers in filming history. And they work together!!!!! Why? Whyyyy? They have written and directed films such as &#x22;Date Movie&#x22;, &#x22;Epic Movie&#x22;, &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22;, &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; and &#x22;Vampires Suck&#x22;. And they work together on &#x22;The Biggest Movie of All Time 3D&#x22;. It will be adventure/comedy. Right? It will be released in 2012. Wow. The Biggest Movie of All Time? And in 3D? Wow again.Sometimes I even like parodies. There are plenty great parodies out there. But this films are simply idiotic. I watched &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; till the end on. I knew it will be extremely stupid, but really I didn&#x27;t expected this.I was thinking: Finally!!! &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; will be disaster for their careers. They will try to made something else with their lives. But nooo... they did it again, and again.Please someone stop them. Or just shot them.	1
If I could give this film zero out of 10 stars, I would have. In fact, even zero may be too generous. Problem 1: A successful movie, even a spoof or parody, needs to have an actual plot, and this one doesn&#x27;t. Problem 2: A successful movie cannot be made by stringing together 90 minutes of tired pop-culture references, lame celebrity impersonations, grotesque sexual innuendo, ridiculous sight gags, mindless profanity, and bad jokes. Problem 3: A successful movie needs more than the cheesiest acting since a 1970&#x27;s After-School Special, and the worst script since &#x22;Plan 9 From Outer Space.&#x22; Problem 4: Jokes you can see coming from a mile away only work if they are actually funny.	1
It really takes a lot for me to hate a movie nowadays. Before I knew the true connotations of the word, I used to toss it around willy-nilly at any film I merely disliked. I&#x27;m even embarrassed by some of the films I used to say I hated. There have been very few films I&#x27;ve hated since I&#x27;ve graduated high school, because by that point I had learned to avoid wasting my father&#x27;s hard-earned dollars on Catwoman and Gigli. But then I walked into this mind- numbing monstrosity of a film that made me want to hurt things. Badly. I wanted to hurt the projectionist for even so much as showing the film, because by screening it that day, he made everybody in that theatre dumber and angrier. There is no plot in the film so to speak, and the jokes are stretched out for painfully long periods of time in order to compensate for the fact that without them, the film would be no more than a glorified television ad. It basically is a glorified television ad in its final form, but nothing more. The fact that people actually gave these untalented hacks money to make something that they probably knew wouldn&#x27;t be any good is proof that the world is going downhill. If there was any justice, the filmmakers would be tied up with piano wire, hurled off a cliff into a sea filled with rich BP oil, and keelhauled through a shredding machine. And all the world would lose would be two shitty movie makers.	1
Although this movie is not the worst movie ever made, but it is sure as hell in the top 3! The storyline is DREADFUL! Over the course of one evening, an unsuspecting group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events. God, how terrible! This movie is a parody of all kind of different movies. But the director of this movie is the first one I have ever seen to make parody COMPLETELY SUCK! First of all this movie try to parody Hancock &#x26; Enchanted, WTF?! Weren&#x27;t those two films already parody&#x27;s? Or satires, what ever you want to call them. Are you a-holes really that desperate for things to make fun of that they resort to satirizing satires? The superheroes and parody of random people, literally appear out of no were, with no reason and no funny jokes or gags to say or do. The acting sucks, the effects suck, the plot sucks, and all in all this movie sucks! The only good thing is at least this movie isn&#x27;t Orgy of the Dead.	1
There were actually a couple (count them - 2) slightly funny parts to this movie: The &#x22;Head-On&#x22; commercial spoof and the spoof of &#x22;Enchanted&#x22;. Unfortunately, they fall flat pretty quickly, and, like the rest of the movie, last way longer than they should. In fact, many of these scenes (Girl-Girl wrestling match, High School Musical skit, Miley Cyrus death, etc.) are uncomfortably long! I actually left during the Chipmunks scene, used the bathroom, made some tea, came back, and it was still going on!!!! I&#x27;m not kidding! Did someone really think it was funny enough to make a scene about fighting a rabid and foul-mouthed version of Alvin and the Chipmunks 15 minutes long. I was actually embarrassed for the actors that had to ham their way through. The acting was bad! The dialogue was horrible! The whole premise was BAD! This movie gives spoof movies an even worse name. Oh, how I long for the days of Airplane, Hotshots, and The Naked Gun. WHO KEEPS GIVING THESE GUYS MONEY TO MAKE THESE MOVIES????	1
Remember the days when the words &#x22;movie spoof&#x22; would conjure up memories of laugh out load comedies such as &#x22;The Naked Gun&#x22;, &#x22;Airplane&#x22;, &#x22;Jane Austen&#x27;s Mafia&#x22; and &#x22;Hot Shot&#x22;? These were the movies that not only made us laugh but made us want to watch the films they lampooned over again. But these types of film can&#x27;t always guarantee to entertain us. Put in the hands of the wrong people you end up with forgettable disasters like &#x22;Silence of the Hams&#x22; and &#x22;Chicken Park&#x22; but in recent years Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have completely destroyed the genre for everyone with their tired, overused jokes, immature gross out &#x22;humour&#x22;, homophobic/racist/sexist stereotypes and their obsession with belittling celebrities and capitalizing on every major film of the year.But Disater Movie is Friedburg&#x27;s and Seltzer&#x27;s worst film yet (I say &#x22;yet&#x22; because, sadly they have more &#x22;ideas&#x22; for future parody films). Now, I confess, I have only seen the first half hour of this film, which I consider an achievement because even the opening scene caused me to be severe pain. I had low hopes for this film in the first place so I waited for it to air on TV to avoid paying to see this garbage. However, as low as my expectations were I found that they were still too far high.The opening scene in a pathetic 10,000 BC parody that targets Amy Winehouse. Now, I&#x27;m no fan of Winehouse but even I get angry when I see stuff like this making light of her drug and alcohol problem. Yes it easier to laugh at someone like this than it is to actually help them but this whole &#x22;joke&#x22; goes too far. But then Friedburg and Seltzer take a break from insulting Winehouse to insulting the viewer but having Winehouse letting out a long 30 second or so burp followed by a series of shorter burps which is supposed to make us say &#x22;Oh that is so clever. Every time I thought she was finished burping she let out another one. Oh Friedburg and Seltzer, you are truly comic geniuses&#x22; but instead we end up screaming out &#x22;OK, she burps. We get it already! ENOUGH!!!&#x22; Next we are treated to a party scene that lampoons &#x22;No Country for Old Men&#x22;, &#x22;Wanted&#x22; &#x22;High School Musical&#x22; &#x22;Juno&#x22; and &#x22;Superbad&#x22; (How these films could be considered disaster movies is beyond me), during which we see Carmen Electra playing the same character she has played in every other &#x22;Movie&#x22; film, a random wrestling scene that was supposed to be &#x22;sexy&#x22;, a few more attacks on celebrities, seemingly endless homophobic/racist/sexist jokes, gross out &#x22;humour&#x22; a musical number that makes the songs from &#x22;Grease 2&#x22; worthy of a Grammy in comparison and then, after a half hour of pointless, mindless drivel do we start to see the parodies of disaster films, which includes bikini-clad women for some reason, Hancock hitting his head on a lamppost, a cow landing on Ironman (characters hitting their head on or being crushed by something is used in every other Friedburg and Seltzer movie, and it wasn&#x27;t funny the first time either) and then Hannah Montana being crushed by a meteorite, in which we see a repeat on the Amy Winehouse burp scene only this time Hannah Montana dies, comes back to life to say something, dies, comes back to life to say something else, dies again and it just goes on like that...and that is when I stopped watching.After sitting through just half an hour of this rubbish I was left asking once more how Friedburg and Seltzer are able to continue making more of these films? Yes, they maybe wildly popular with immature teenagers but surely they must be losing the studio money? These movies offer nothing new, there is no real story structure, no character development, awful acting, jokes you can see coming a mile off which are dragged out and outstay their welcome (if they were welcomed in the first place) and 6 months down the track you can expect to see the DVD copy for 50 cents in a cheap shop or sold along with a more popular movie. Hell, if I was even offered this movie for free I&#x27;d consider that offer a rip off.So in closing the only thing I can say to Friedburg and Seltzer is &#x22;OK, WE GET IT!!! ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!	1
What is there to say about Disaster Movie. In one word: Pathetic. I rated it one star but really wanted to rate it half or even less. There is no editing team what so ever as the scenes go for way to long. From the intro with Amy, the extremely drawn out &#x27;curve the bullet&#x27; skit, the standard two girls fighting bit, (only good if you pause it)through to the end. I&#x27;m not sure why it&#x27;s called Disaster Movie as most of the things they so lamely attempt to spoof have nothing to do with that type of movie.I did watch the whole thing as I didn&#x27;t want to comment on it if I had not in case there was something funny at the end...silly, silly me. One thing i would love to know is how they got the budget to make such un-funny crap when the networks are canceling some shows that they think are not rating high enough.Granted some children might find it funny sometimes, but adults shouldn&#x27;t. The final question is &#x27;is there anything redeeming about this film&#x27;? Yes. It has an ending.	1
Wow. &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22;, huh? Fitting title, plus they had a disaster script to match.Way to go. You&#x27;ve officially turned cinema into a spectator&#x27;s sport. Pathetic, and people actually go to see garbage like this! What is the future of cinema coming to? Please, do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY, FAR AWAY. It&#x27;s for your own good, trust me. Even I could have done better than this, and I don&#x27;t even know how to direct. But apparently, neither did these people. I wouldn&#x27;t even give this--thing--the honor of calling it a movie. I&#x27;ll stick with &#x27;thing&#x27;.1/10. If I could give a rating less than 0, I would. Maybe -10. Please, stick to the classics, like the Monty Python movies. THOSE are actually funny! Maybe the directors and writers of this film should open their eyes and stop writing things like this. Disgusting.	1
Nothing in Disaster Movie works. The actors don&#x27;t even try, the jokes are the worst I have ever heard, the effects are painful to watch, the parodies are horrible, everything fails. The jokes are extremely unfunny, random at times, often don&#x27;t feel like they have punch lines, and they go forever. In a film that is less than an hour and a half the jokes should not all be a minute long. When a joke is told the film feels like you just hit pause. The film stops, tells the very long and terrible joke, and when it is over and the film moves on it just stops again for another bad joke just seconds later. The parodies are unfunny, random at times, and make me feel horrible. All the jokes in the film are either physical (unfunny) or parody (very unfunny). A parody is meant to make someone laugh about something they&#x27;ve seen. This makes parodies the wrong way. Instead of making fun and at the same time honoring the thing being parodied Disaster Movie does neither of those two things. It doesn&#x27;t honor anything. It doesn&#x27;t make fun of much. The parodies are just there. The parodies most of the time are just the character from another movie saying that they are that character and then the character gets hurt. This is due to the parodies being made from trailers of the movies. Friedberg and Seltzer give a bad name to parodies when there is a lot of good parodies. Now to due this and other films under the same two directors the parody genre should retire. In the end Disaster Movie is a true disaster.0 stars out of 4Also an MJ molesting joke in 2008. At the time MJ jokes hadn&#x27;t been considered funny for years. The was just failure to realize a change in humor.	1
I didn&#x27;t get farther then 20 minutes into the movie. This film is an insult to my intelligence. I should sue the two idiotic film makers for extensive emotional damage. There&#x27;s a scene where they poke fun at a commerical that probably aired in whichever part of the country Freidberg and Seltzer were in at the time. The commercial didn&#x27;t air in other parts of the country, so I had to google the joke in the movie. for the love of god, if i had to google what a joke in a movie was making fun of, you just know the film is a fail so epic it overflows the integer of fail and wraps it right the hell around the universe.I am now stupider after seeing this movie.	1
Friedberg and Seltzer, hacksters supremo, ram more worthless dung down your throat. It&#x27;s the same old tiresome formula: use a genre name in the title, reference recent movies in skits, hammer in some potty humor, have plenty of people get kicked in the groin, and call it a movie. They even throw in a Michael Jackson barb for the millionth time. I&#x27;m guessing the obsession of these guys regarding MJ will continue even now that he&#x27;s dead.Disaster flicks and their endless corny clich&#xE9;s are ripe for funny satire, but these two hacks don&#x27;t even address disaster movies. They just churn out one lame scene after another, and you&#x27;re supposed to laugh just because you recognize what movie a particular character was ripped off from. The reenactments are lame. The fart jokes are below even a little kid&#x27;s humor. The production technique is pathetic. The mugging and shouting by actors is embarrassing.Could Friedberg and Seltzer explain to everyone what is funny about a fairy tale princess shooting a race car driver, dozens of times? What was that? And what&#x27;s up with that midget actor, again? &#x22;Let&#x27;s rehash a joke that didn&#x27;t work the first 800 times.&#x22; Nobody&#x27;s laughing. Except for the hacks that made this. They&#x27;re laughing all the way to the bank.	1
This review is from: Disaster Movie (Unrated Widescreen) (DVD) I like most movies I watch, and try to find a good side of them all. Sometimes I think that they are overrated; and sometimes under appreciated. But this film was the WORST!! The jokes were bad The humor was simply grotesque (women lactose jokes, water breaking jokes - not funny) The parodies were bad A weak and poor storyline. I am quite a fan of some satire films, particularly the Scary Movies. I&#x27;m all for slapstick humor, like Naked Gun or Hot Shots. But this film is horrible. At least it is only about 80 minutes long - but it was the worst 80 minutes of film to ever be released.	1
Story of how i watched this &#x22;film&#x22;- I was late to a meet up with friends at the cinema, so they had already i bought the ticket for me and everything. I recoiled in horror when i saw the title on the ticket, and i threatened to go home. But i told myself, &#x22;hey it can&#x27;t possibly be worse than epic movie? I mean no producer would be stupid enough to let a film worse than that through?&#x22; Oh dear God was i wrong.The fact that even the thought of this film existed is an insult to all of mankind. I sat squirming in my seat for 45 minutes of this film, and i consider myself i failure for not walking out sooner. The references to other (far better) films are so painful that you want to stab the film. Literally. Many (in fact come to think about perhaps all) of the &#x22;Jokes&#x22; are merely the appearance of another film&#x27;s character, which are badly impersonated and contain no satire on the character at all, just a fart joke or something equally pathetic.Are Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer perhaps worthy of being hated even more than Uwe Boll? OH GOD YES!!! I beg anyone who is in close contact with these people to chop of their hands, so then they will be unable to sign anymore movie deals.	1
Ever see &#x22;Idiocracy&#x22;? Welcome to the future.Jason Friedberg &#x26; Aaron Seltzer are the worst filmmakers in history, but they cater to the bottom of the barrel. They are geniuses in the sense that people like the ones who actually gave this movie a higher rating than 1 watch their movies. And continue to buy tickets.They don&#x27;t even parody, they grab a bunch of actors who vaguely resemble people they can make fun of.I saw parts of this movie and Meet The Spartans accidentally on cable and couldn&#x27;t even sit through the scenes. Amy Winehouse belching for 2 minutes straight? Did anyone other than a 5 year old think that was funny? I feel bad for the actors who get roped into these films, do they really think this will help their careers? And the ones who actually have a career? Oh, Kevin Sorbo, how far you&#x27;ve fallen. WTF are they thinking? This just cements their F list status.Why do they keep giving these guys money and the first rate production values that go along with them when there are filmmakers out there with far more talent and imagination who can&#x27;t even get their scripts read.No wonder the movie business is going into the toilet. Shame on Hollywood for continuing to green light this crap.	2
The writing/directing team of Friedberg and Seltzer has released such movies as Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans. All of them were horrendous, but moderately successful in the box office. For the Labor Day weekend, they released their latest gem, Disaster Movie, in which they whipped up in a month. Please note that this was a spoof film that went through the entire production, without ever seeing the movie, only the trailers.The plot is very simple. Over the course of one evening, a group of twenty-somethings find themselves bombarded by a series of natural disasters and catastrophic events. A large problem with this is that there is no time for character development, and the viewer wouldn&#x27;t care anyway due to the lack of stars in the movie. These events could be tornadoes, rabid chipmunks or just a random fistfight.I found it very difficult to believe that this movie was actually a true spoof on disaster movies and it is most likely to be spoofing movies from this summer. This movie doesn&#x27;t even work as the traditional spoof movie does where it uses only one film, this movie much less interesting spoofs of movies that will be forgotten about in a few years, making this movie no longer relevant. They makers think they can get away with having some unoriginal character come on and off thirty seconds later. These include what if Batman was an idiot, or if Iron Man was crushed by a cow, or if the Hulk gets crushed by a cow. The material clearly isn&#x27;t funny but it&#x27;s trying to be which is the most important factor for this movie to fail miserably. Why have the same two actors play all of the parts, they&#x27;re not fooling anyone.This movie is truly awful and unwatchable, which is not something I can often say about the movies I see. There should be no excuse for a comedy to have more hip hop dance (4) sequences than laughs. I do not recommend this movie because it is an enormous waste of everyone&#x27;s time, except if you&#x27;re writing up a review of it.	1
The title is totally misleading; it was nothing more than an attention getter for what amounts to a stream-of-consciousness lampoon of other movies popular at the time, most of them NOT disaster movies. During the first fifteen minutes, I kept wondering if what I was seeing was supposed to be the funny stuff and waited, trying to give it a chance. No funny stuff ever emerged. I wish I could give it a vote less than 1. How bad was it? Okay, my spouse and I watch a lot of movies; at least five a week borrowed from the library. (If we had rented this one, I&#x27;d be screaming my head off for a refund!) We watch on big screen in a double recliner. To watch &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; on a chilly evening, we were snuggled up under a woolen throw, and our cat was on my lap. She has never before offered comment on a movie, except to maybe get up an leave during particularly noisy ones. During &#x22;Disaster Movie,&#x22; about halfway through, she sat up and upchucked in my lap. Nuff said. My spouse and I thoroughly agree.	1
I rented this movie and pressed &#x22;Stop&#x22; after 30 min! I have to agree with everyone else that this film is just a complete waste of time! The other movies of this franchise had some funny instances, but I really failed to see any funny instances in this cruddy film! How did this make it to the big screen? If anything, this should have just went to DVD under the genre &#x22;Crap of all craps!&#x22; They really need to start making movies with &#x22;real humor!&#x22; It seems that they try to incorporate all types of different movies to follow a certain plot, but it just doesn&#x27;t work very well. Also, they try to make it funny by adding all types of scenes that they feel will catch the audience&#x27;s eyes, but it is just ridiculous and overplayed. Please, please, please...do not make any more movies as this...you can&#x27;t make us laugh, you can&#x27;t produce...you&#x27;re too old! Stay home with your spouse and feed your 2 dozen cats! Leave the movie industry to &#x22;real&#x22; producers and directors!	1
Some twenty something man named Will (Matt Latner) had an unusual dream where he was in the movie &#x22;10000 B.C&#x22; as Amy Whitehouse warns him that the end of the world is gonna happen. However it has became reality as disasters are occurring in the city as friends like Calvin (G. Thang Johnson), Amy (Vanessa Minnolo) and Enchanted Princess (Nicole Parker) all join forces to battle against ravenous singing chipmunks, fight Beowulf and Kung Fu Panda, deal with superheros and even return the Crystal Skull back to save the world.An unbelievable mess of a movie! Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer who gave us the awful parody movies &#x22;Date Movie&#x22;, &#x22;Epic Movie&#x22; and &#x22;Meet The Spartans&#x22; have finally done a movie worse then any of them. Despite having the talented Kim Kardashian, Carmen Elektra and Tony Cox the movie is just one hopeless movie. Despite it&#x27;s title, it only spoofs a few actual disaster movies like &#x22;Armageddon&#x22;, &#x22;Cloverfield&#x22; and &#x22;Twist&#x22; but spoofs non-disaster movies like &#x22;High School Musical&#x22;, &#x22;Beowulf&#x22;, &#x22;Kung Fu Panda&#x22;, &#x22;Wanted&#x22;, &#x22;Iron Man&#x22;, &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22;, &#x22;Incredible Hulk&#x22; etc. and other movies that were released recently and the year after. They just reference stuff without trying to spoof them and throw pop culture references into the jokes without being funny, tasteless vulgar jokes that are very forehead slapping and groan inducing and beyond awful acting.This movie looks like it was filmed in a cardboard box, it&#x27;s that bad! avoid this crap at all cost.	1
I&#x27;ve always been a big fan of IMDb &#x26; have rated tons of movies I have seen; although I&#x27;ve never written a review on one. I decided to watch this movie knowing it would be stupid based on ratings but figured it would be a &#x27;funny&#x27; (i.e. Scary Movie) type of stupid. Boy was I wrong. I do not recall even laughing one time. I&#x27;ve seen some bad movies in my time but I would have to say this is the worst of the worst. I do not recommend even bothering to watch it and I thank God that I didn&#x27;t pay to see it. Horrible.I normally always give a movie a try regardless of ratings. This is one time I should have listened and stayed away. I just wasted 88 minutes of my life on this one. Would have just turned it off but I kept saying it will get better lol. It didn&#x27;t./i3luechaos\	1
Wow are there people who liked this movie??? If so then you HAVE to be a pretty lame person this along with: Meet The Spartans, The Comebacks, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Another Gay Movie and Superhero the Movie were all very stupid movies if you actually get a kick out of repetitive spoofs mostly making fun of a crappy actor or Micheal Jackson then you must have the brain of a tick. Seriously what keeps assholes like you alive? if one joke and cheap spoofs that again are the same in every singles spoof movie keeps you laughing then i think my time on this earth has passed see ya later in the afterlife where i just may have super godly powers and i will dominate your weak, idiotic spirits you will never ever reach heaven or hell or Valhalla or where ever you go i will make sure of it!! And if you think i am joking look down your pants you are slowly corroding from your crotch and soon will spread to the rest of your body....and hopefully to your family and friends and i will sleep like a baby sucking on my mamas breast. Being mean is fun. I will laugh for days when your dick or vaginas fall off and the crows feast upon it. HEY maybe i will join them! I havent tasted COCK since the last time i watch Disaster Movie! I will be going for now, but be weary i will return!! Thimbalterot has spoken!!	1
Gigli, Howard the Duck, Tank Girl, and Ishtar were Oscar material compared to this piece of tripe.EVERY SINGLE JOKE fell flat on its face. There were no laughs in the audience, just the occasional groan of pain.Everything was so disjointed it was merely a series of badly written skits, not a movie.Its a real shame that true slapstick and parody has died in the face of movies such as this. Later Naked Gun sequels and the first scary movie still had a sense of what comedy is. But someone whos dressed like Amy Winehouse standing there farting for well over a minute isnt funny, its boring and a really poor attempt at humor.Just remember, if you take the time, or god forbid spend money to see this movie, I warned you.	1
I seriously dont know what to say about this movie! Ive just downloaded it because I didnt ever want to be stung by this pair of miscreants again, and thank god for the delete option! This movie is listed in the Comedy genre..... why? Its not remotely funny. For a film to aim for laughs, and miss every one of them, you have to wonder if theres some sort of misadvertising going on.Its called Disaster Movie, cmon guys, its like shooting fish in a barrel with a title like that! The story if you can call it that is Cloverfield, but without the skill behind the camera, and without the writing skills on the screenplay.Interspersed with the story are lots of humourous meetings with characters from other movies. That in itself wouldnt be a problem, if these humourous cameos actually served a purpose, or, more importantly, added something funny, which they dont.... frequently! There is also the same problem that plagued Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans, namely, characters either announcing themselves, or other characters telling us who they are!?! Is it because the directors thought the impersonations of the various characters was rubbish and therefore needed to be explained, or was it because they wanted to help us poor mentally challenged people along? (I call myself mentally challenged for actually watching this crap from start to end!) If you have to explain your cameo characters, chances are, they are either crap or not funny.... or both! There is actually one point in the movie where they parody a parody, a scene where they are beating the crap out of the lead characters girlfriend, almost a lift from Airplane! Quite a lot of people havent spotted that this is simply a retread of Epic Movie and more so Meet the Spartans.Characters have a problem, and need to get to a destination which is fraught with difficulties. Thats Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans!!!!! In the middle of MTS there is a dance number, in Disaster Movie theres two, More of the same, plus a little bit more! There was only ONE redeeming feature of this movie, and that was Nicole Parker as the Enchanted Princess, her performance was quite acceptable, but that could soley be down to the diabolical performances of her co-stars making hers look better. With a better script, her take off of Amy Adams would have been quite good.As for the rest of the performances, just utter crap! They were easily recognisable (even with without the dumb pointers to help out!), but the script (if you can call it that) just didnt do anything or go anywhere.This movie also suffers from the same syndrome as MTS, namely being padded out to give them impression its a feature length movie. It isnt. Some of the scenes go on and on for seemingly no benefit, several dance/music routines that go on way too long, and not funny to boot. The Sarah Silverman rip off at the end, just more padding, and horrendously NOT funny at all.I cannot comprehend how people could find this funny, I really cannot. I have a good sense of humour, I like a good parody, this however is not good and not even a parody. Airplane! is an absolute riot, and even though ive watched it time and again, and know the jokes inside and out, its platinum coated viewing in comparison to this mess.I only watched this out of morbid curiosity to see just how bad it was, and it is every bit as bad as youve been led to believe.If you must watch this movie, for the love of god, dont pay for it, pay for another movie and sneak in to see this, or, more sensibly, download it for free, paying to see it is something akin to paying someone to stomp on your face... with steel toe cap boots.... with nails sticking out of the soles... you get the idea! Friedberg and Seltzer are not skilled at what they do, its why they are content to rip off other movies, because they lack the skills to do their own camera angles, their own scripts.Their back catalogue is nothing but parody movies, they lack the skills to do something ORIGINAL that does ride on the coat tails of someone elses work.I note with interest that Fox were not interested in releasing this movie, and the Box Office for it thus far is showing it to be a flop. Hopefully Lionsgate will decline to release any more of their movies.The jokes over now boys, youve been rumbled, its time to find something else to do with your time as making movies is not your forte.Avoid!	1
I am so glad I got a friend to play for my ticket. I honestly couldn&#x27;t how sick I would feel even to this day if I paid to this movie. I tried to watch &#x22;Meet the Spartan&#x22; a year or so before this and I felt sick to the stomach after watching it, so I was expecting nothing from this.The first scene had Amy Winehouse belching for about 2 minutes in the face of a character from 10,000 BC. I knew what I would expect from the rest of the film. What followed was reference after reference of things that were out a week before this film was made (because we all know no one can remember anything from over a month ago). I did not laugh once and I just had to leave the cinema 45 minutes in. Honestly, I would imagine a 5 year old writing better stuff. I&#x27;m speechless that it even got to DVD, let alone the cinema.I know this has nothing to do with the movie, but two of my best friends actually liked this movie. I stopped being their friends instantly and I haven&#x27;t talked to them since. THAT is how bad this movie is.	1
This is a spoof of the latest blockbuster movies amidst a background of disaster.I thought it would be a comical spoof of disaster movies, but instead it does not even spoof. It references many unrelated blockbusters that each movie appear for only a few seconds. Hence it lacks a coherent theme to stick the spoofs together.In addition, the jokes are very unfunny. They are so overdone, over the top and annoying. For example, the scene where a princess murders someone is so overdone. It might be remotely funny if she shoots once or twice, but not when she shoots for fifteen seconds.Spoof movies can be funny and entertaining, but Disaster Movie is a complete disaster that bores me to hell. I kept wishing it to end, and when it did, I was so glad it ended.	2
To answer another contributors comment, they make this kind of garbage because it sells in some markets. Here in the Middle East, movies that are: over the top, brutal, have toilet/silly humor, or have a scene that gets by the censors results in box office lineups. Movies appeal differently to each overseas market, but violent, risqu&eacute;, or nonsense humor does well in many of them. Movies that come in between 8 and 9 on the IMDb scale usually dont do well here. They are perceived as too subtle (boring), are character driven (characters dont tear up the screen), have a message to tell (dont lecture me) or have a strong cultural theme (REAL American life is not interesting), dont do well. Blockbusters with mega stars do well everywhere. But movies like Disaster movie go straight to DVD and overseas markets. Shameful but true.	1
In many ways Disaster Movie is like Ronseal. It does exactly what it says on the tin. The movie is a disaster. It makes you cringe and cry far more than making you laugh. To keep with the ronseal feel the acting is horribly wooden. The whole whole thing is a mess.When are these spoof movies going to end? None have produced laughs! Date movie, Superhero Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans are all way below average. with the exception of Superhero movie they are all under 3/10 rated on this very site!Friedberg and Seltzer should both be banned from the movie industry. I never want to see anything made by them. They know of one genre, pathetic.I admit I did not see all of this film. I like many other people at the cinema with me walked out before the end. Even with the two for one offer on tickets, I wish I didnt pay. Its part of my life I will never get back. I couldve had more fun castrating myself.	1
First off, Im not at all considered a movie critic of any sort. My expertise on movies derives from the sole fact that Ive seen so many, and usually keep up on most current flicks. I also dont write reviews like this often.However, sometimes I see a movie that is so incredibly awful, that I can no longer hold my tongue. This is a perfect example of such a creation. There are so many negatives to focus on, theres no way Ill get through them all before I suffer a massive brain aneurysm, as I nearly did watching this pathetic excuse of a motion picture.If you see Carmen Electra in ANY movie these days, you can bet its going to be total crap (I wasnt even a fan of the Scary Movie series, so my opinion may be biased to some of you). She had a part in Meet the Spartans as well, which is easily tied with this monstrosity as Worst Movie of 2008, possibly even the decade. Kim Cardashian is in this movie! Enough said. Vanessa Minnillo? Yeah, shes pretty. Just continue with that. The abundance of tight female abs, bras, boobs and overall sex appeal wasnt at all, in any way shape or form enough to make this movie even a small fraction more tolerable.The cameos were lame. The impersonations were half-assed and done by actors/actresses that dont at all resemble the person they were hired to imitate.This movie also seems to revolve around characters getting squashed by random objects falling from the sky. Thats not funny in most scenarios anyway. Imagine that same occurrence being thrown at you several times throughout a movie. Each time, prefaced and followed by some lackluster line delivered by a poor actor/actress.Theres ONE positive I can think of, and thats the Juno character, whose name is Juney, played by Crista Flanagan. I found that character to be funny AT TIMES, but thats because Im highly sarcastic myself and find such humor amusing.The general spoofs throughout are uninspired, clich&eacute;, and poorly executed.There were several musical parts in the movie as well. I dont enjoy such things in movies most would consider good. To add them to a movie as atrocious as this, and make them as pathetic as the rest of the movie, is flat out torture for all viewers.Im nearing the fabled aneurysm I spoke of earlier, so Ill stop, as I did with this movie one hour into it. No, I didnt finish it, and if any of you have an ounce of dignity, youll do the same, or not watch it at all.I dont feel I need to provide you with any other evidence to contribute to your decision to not watch this. What Ive said should deter anybody from watching this.It is %*&^ing awful.	1
I guess the title already tells you everything you need to know about the movie. It is without a doubt a total disaster. I still find it quite amazing that writer directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer still managed to get funds to have their films made, after equally disastrous unfunny comedies such as Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans (OK, I shall unabashedly say that I enjoyed Date Movie), because while its spoof after spoof, it certainly isnt cheap trying to replicate certain stuff, even if done laced with loads of cheese, or swede-d.Should there be a story linking everything little crazy thing together, then it would be Cloverfield, where a group of friends Will (Matt Lanter, whose left year I found strangely out of alignment with his right?), Calvin (G. Thang), Juney (Crista Flanagan), Lisa (Kimberly Kardashian) and the Enchanted Princess (Nicole Parker) journey to save Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) before getting themselves out of the city to escape some unknown and best forgotten natural calamity, where the threat of mankind is raining cows.The only merit I would give the filmmakers is how they went ballistic and stretched their imagination to milk every possible opportunity to script in some other movie, be it borrowing characters or premise. Youd probably lose count at the something-new-at-every-minute strategy, and frankly speaking, theyre at best some skits which for the life of me, are totally unfunny. Nada, zilch, nothing to laugh about. I guess even kids will find the juvenile humour here a total turn off.Which is not strange, considering that even jokes were borrowed, and relied too heavily on the usual toilet humour, which is already so tired. While there are comedies which can be original, the pedigree of Friedberg and Seltzer, coming as scriptwriters for Scary Movie(s), would by now reinforce that they make poor stories and jokes from their lack of innovation. Being able to string together countless of movies is one thing, but making a genuine and workable comedy is another. Not having an established cast to star in your movie might stem from a modest budget to work with, but Im likely to think that everyone approached, save for the relative no-names here, would not want to touch this even with a ten foot pole, just in case it really stinks and stain their filmography.I think its even time for me to put a foot down and say No to Friedberg and Seltzer. The powers that be should really dry up the credit line that fuel their productions, and given some belt-tightening in the economy, hopefully this should be soon.	1
One word: Disaster. Matt Lanter stars as Will, who has a dream in which sabertooth Amy Winehouse tells a caveman (who just finished playing Gladiators) that the world will end in 2008, then burps in his face a couple dozen times....uh...anyway, the dream comes true, so Will, some teenagers and a few movie characters have to fight for survival against the apocalypse.Why the hell are these spoof movies still being made? They were good up until the extraordinarily unfunny Date Movie came out and theyve been dreadful ever since. The first two Scary Movies were great and hilarious but recent spoofs such as Meet The Spartans and Superhero Movie are quite simply awful. And now heres Disaster Movie from Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the writers/directors of Meet The Spartans. They obviously realise that their films arent exactly critically acclaimed but they seem to have some strange thought that we, the public, enjoy their films. I wonder if theyd still think that if they saw that on IMDb, 85.3% of 12,687 voters rated this film 1/10. Hm....maybe we hate their films and dont want them to be made! Despite my little rant there, Im going to admit that I did laugh a few times throughout Disaster Movie. Most of the jokes are terrible and made me want to stop watching but some are genuinely funny. In the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin And The Chipmunks appear, I cringed and thought the film couldnt get worse but when they started head banging and singing a rock song I couldnt help but laugh.Some scenes in Disaster Movie do tend to drone on. For example, the High School Musical spoof sequence during the party is unnecessarily long and tedious. Also, the part where Hannah Montana is stuck under an asteroid is funny at first but the joke wares on and on to the point where I was thinking GET ON WITH THE FILM! One thing that I noticed about the film is that the writers seem to be desperate to cram in as much movie spoofs as possible in the hope that they can gain a laugh. However, the amount spoofed is strangely annoying and frustrating. And the very loose plot pretty much disappears and is pushed aside for more film references.It may be funny at some points but Disaster Movie lives up to its title. I give it 2/10.	1
This isnt so much a review of the film, Which I did go see, and I did run out and hug a tree after, but more a open letter to the two film con artist that made it and the others like it. I dont write on these message boards or do any kind of reviews, because for the most part, I love watching movies. This summer has been the best for movies in a long time. Even movies that didnt live up to the hype, I found something enjoyable in them. But, In watching this latest movie that these two came out with, I had to think, Do they even care? why would you two try and at least write a funny joke? Parodies are hard to do. But, when done right, Like Scary Movie, Airplane, Top gun, (add your favorite here) you can not only laugh yourself into a coma, you can also see the hard work that went into them. Hard work that Jason and Arron know nothing about. They think, as long as young people go see them, Then theyll keep making them. So, here is what I would like to say to you Jason and Arron -- If you really did have anything to do with scary movie like you make everyone think you did, then you would step up and accept this challenge. If by some insane chance, that any studio would ever allow you to make another movie, Do what others have done with Scary Movie go out and get good writers who will bust their asses to make a movie that you can be proud of. Take all the money youve made off of these Unfunny things that you call movies and pay good writers to help you.I challenge you to do this. I know you love movies. You have to. So, try and make a good one.Thanks for the garbage.	1
