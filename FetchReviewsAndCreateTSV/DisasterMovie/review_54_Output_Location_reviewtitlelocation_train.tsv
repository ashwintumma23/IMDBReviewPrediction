The fact that aspiring actors, directors, and writers cant find work while this crap is produced is absolutely appalling.	United States	*Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldnt be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this film, I could write my shortest review, ever. Dont see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think Ill go on for a bit.I dont know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesnt matter. Theyre all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, its film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films get away with it, Ill give Disaster Movie a pass here).The jokes are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (theres some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I dont care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization.	1
Not Humorous...in the least bit	United States	I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this film. How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled Disaster Movie, should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being Twister. How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldnt say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I cant believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. Its an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.Rating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour Manos: The Hands of Fate marathon than watch this slop.	1
Theres just no point anymore	Canada	Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, Im just going to be making a few observations and points Ive deduced.Theres just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know theres going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, THIS IS SPARTA! and, IM RICK JAMES BITCH so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Dont see this movie. Dont spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and then silently judge the people that are talking about this movie on Monday. Do yourself a favor.	1
The irony is very correct.	Canada	Since the name of the movie is Disaster Movie. The basic irony is that its a ****ING DISASTER! A 90 minute **** flick based on pop culture and movie trailers. My god, Seltzer, retire and live off the money you made from your other below 3 star rated pieces of horse ****, please. Now when you do these type of movies, youre never going to get the jokes in 5 years, maybe even 2. Theyre just wasting their time, not really. Theyre just wasting our time. But whoever goes and sees this are brainless (Hypocrite moment) but bare with me, I got in for free and I regret it.A free ticket, and a bad nightmare.Do not watch this, support other films that are coming out today whom deserve it more.Come on, do you REALLY want more of these? **** guys, just ****.	1
Awful, pure stupidity	United States	This movie I saw a day early for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. It is totally brain dead. Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see Idiocracy? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. Date Movie was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes spoofs (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with Meet the Spartans and Superhero Movie all falling flat.Well Ive wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, dont see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.Thanks, R	1
Wait... What?	United States	Honestly, what is wrong with you, Hollywood? Not only is this the WORST thing that has happened to you ---- you keep funding these cheesy writers of Scary Movie to make these movies. I mean, come on Carmen Electra, you know even better than them that you have potential! Stop portraying in parody movies! See, I cant believe I am comparing parody to this movie. This movie has no parody or comedy in it, this is all referencing. All they need to do is see a movie title, take a line and a scene from a trailer, and turn it into a script. Never in my LIFE have I ever been so ticked off by you (Hollywood).I mean, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, you dont even care for the money, you just want to prove you can be a film-maker too, but thats not the point! Movies are something you should enjoy, and this... this is making bland jokes and pointless (as I may say comedy) with fart jokes and people being hit with objects... or just getting hurt (but you realize that they are okay)?Now please, STOP! Youre ruining the name of parody and you are causing people to hate you even more!Please, as a warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS.	1
Someone please put an end to Seltzers awful career	Cold Spring, KY	I was given a free ticket to this film; so I cant complain that I was ripped off (except in that some 90 minutes of my life were irretrievably stolen from me). These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) havent been funny for some time now but Disaster Movie has reached a new low. There wasnt one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged jokes were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but Disaster Movie may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it.	1
Disastrous	Upstate New York	OK, so Disastrous isnt an imaginative barb for this movie, but then theres not a shred of wit to the movie, so....I saw this movie for free. A friend who said he pissed his pants at the trailer had free passes. I think hes incontinent.A spoof of disaster movies might have been fun. This is not it. A couple disaster movies get referenced, not really spoofed. Instead, the spoofing is of recent movies of all genres, and of aspects of current pop-culture. Then again, how current is womens wrestling or the Head On commercials?If theres anything about it thats good, theres the 70 minute or so running time (where did they get 90 minutes?) and Nicole Parker seems like she might be good, if she had good material.	1
Never EVER make a bet with your friends	United States	If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. Ill tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well Ive been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my friends and that wasnt a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well Im warning you at least. It shouldnt even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..Im sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).Oh and please, the random wrestling scene? I dont know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldnt have something in a movie that doesnt add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you wouldve gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps Im grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.But lastly (well Ive got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.I give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies, or mediocre for that matter.	1
My Eyes!!!!	United States	Its hard to imagine anyone writing a spoof movie even worse than Meet the Spartans, but Seltzer and Friedberg have pulled it off. Its not even just a little worse. It makes Spartans look like Raiders of the Lost Ark in comparison. You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out.May Contain Spoilers....if you care: First off, as it appeared in the trailer, this movie does not spoof, or really even reference disaster movies at all. The set shakes a few times, there are some plastic asteroids, and a bad cgi tornado, all of which that do nothing to add anything to the movie, but other than this theres nothing even relating this to said style of film. Instead we get references (not to be confused with actual spoofs) to such films as High School Musical, Step Up, this summers crop of comic based films, Enchanted, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Kung Fu Panda, and Sex and the City. I cant wait to hear Seltzer and Friedberg praise their own genius and describe this movie as being modeled around Cloverfield...they clearly tried to do this, but other than the outline of the small group of people running through the city trying to find the injured girlfriend, theres nothing relating this piece of crap to the monster movie.I can honestly say I did not laugh once at this movie. All of the jokes were forced, and many of them were dragged on for several minutes at a time...the two writers clearly thinking they were onto some kind of comedy gold here. Probably the most insulting thing about this movie is, like all their other gems: Epic, Date, Spartans, they consider the audience to be mentally challenged...having to tell us point blank what movie it is they are referencing (again...not spoofing) Such lines like: Its an inconvenient truth, its global warming, Come here you kung fu panda, what is this enchanted place, How do you know all this? I know because I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Let me get my Get Smart phone (proceeds to talk on his shoe), and whats with the marching band? I thought Id cheer you up with a high school musical all exist to make sure were in on their super intelligent antics.Please, save your money for anything else. Show Hollywood that they need to stop these two guys from making any more movies. I cant even imagine a 5 year old finding this stuff funny. Speaking of 5 years old, thats about how long many of these jokes will last before absolutely no one can find them funny anymore since, as usual, most of them are simply based on pop culture references.	1
An honest comment from someone who has actually seen the movie	Chicago, Illinois	Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the way everyone talks about these guys are as if they are on America&#x27;s Most Wanted List, boy there is a lot of hate before the release date of Disaster Movie. They have brought us the &#x22;stupid&#x22; comedies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, pretty much all those movies have had the same hate, I can understand why. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C&#x27;s and D&#x27;s, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it&#x27;s the exact same thing with movies. The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment. I hated Date Movie, didn&#x27;t mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans. We have recycled jokes from the guy&#x27;s previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you&#x27;ll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming. All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another. But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world. Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.Disaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn&#x27;t help but laugh. There are just some fun moments, I think it&#x27;s ridicules that some people can not admit that. That&#x27;s the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn&#x27;t even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining... this isn&#x27;t the IMDb that I know, it&#x27;s silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it. Back onto the movie, my main thing that I&#x27;m upset with, this movie didn&#x27;t need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along. For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight. I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.1/10	1
Worst. Movie. Ever.	United States	First things first: disregard the rating above because they dont allow for rating low enough for this movie. I would honestly say 0 for real numbers although negative would be more appropriate since I left the theater feeling worse than when i entered.Next, I have to preface this by saying I only watched the first half of the movie. Ill also add that I have never walked out of a movie theater and i would have walked out far earlier if I were by myself. Luckily i saw it for free so those idiots who made it will get no profit from me.I presume that this movie is meant to be a comedy yet in 45 minutes i did not even chuckle at the movie. I laughed at my friends face because it matched my own: Why are we subjecting ourselves to this? Crude humor can be funny, idiotic humor can be funny. Somehow Disaster Movie takes these kinds of humor to a lower level than I have ever seen. I have seen nearly all the other movies of this variety and they had some remote humor, this had none.I do not think hallucinogenic drugs could have salvaged this movie experience.I felt like someone should make a TV infomercial warning against these movies. Like the ones that tell kids not to smoke or say If you have mesothelioma you are entitled to monetary compensation, call this number for details. If I had possessed the materials I would have made a shirt to warn people constantly about this.Please do not see this movie. Although if you know someone you need to get back at tell them to see this.	1

A Movie That Made Me Cry	United States	I normally dont cry in movies. Forrest Gump, Big Fish, Schindlers List, and many others have passed before my eyes, and not a tear has been shed. I consider myself a lover of cinema, with an appreciation for the art of film. I love many genres, including comedy, action, and of course, zombie movies. All of this aside, I watched Disaster Movie this afternoon, and it elicited one emotion from me: Anger.I have never been so irritated in all of my adult life by a movie. I have watched these cretins put out all of this filth that masquerades as entertainment, and have held my tongue until now. I will say this right now: anyone who finds these movies entertaining should be ashamed of themselves. I generally believe that people can have whatever opinion they want, but people that actually like these movies are contributing to the downfall of the art form of cinema. By encouraging LionsGate to continue making these horrendous movies, all we are doing is perpetrating a cultural crime that we may never be able to fix. I grow weary of the multitudes who flock to theaters to see this garbage, and I weep for the future of our nation if this is what passes for entertainment these days.None of the jokes are funny. The parodies of films like Juno and 10,000 BC fail to amuse, and even the lampooning of unexplainable culture phenomena like Hannah Montana and Amy Winehouse is an exercise in futility. No one has ever tried to do more with fecal matter and farm animals than this movie did, and it failed miserably.I beg all of you, as a lover of movies, not to see this film. It is an absolute atrocity, and I guarantee you will feel stupider for having watched it.PS: I work at a theater, so the only reason I even saw this movie was for job purposes. I didnt pay to see it, and neither should you.	1
Someone please kill Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer	Ontario, Canada	If nobody does, I will. After the critically panned Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, these two assholes decide to make another. Its the same formula, they make fun of popular movies in a tired, unfunny fashion.I saw it with a few friends, hoping maybe I could get maybe one or two laughs out of it (I didnt expect anything). When I came out, I was seriously stunned at how lame the movie was. One friend actually liked it, all I had to say was, What have you been smoking lately?.Im not even going to bother explaining the plot, since there really isnt a plot at all. All I can say is, dont waste your money watching the film. It contains no genuinely funny humor and is one of the worst movies ever made. And everyone thought Meet the Spartans bad, wait until they get a load of this one.	1
100% Disaster !!	Qatar	Why i went to the midnight showing of this movie i dont know but i guess its better then buying a ticket to this movie. Honestly i cant say i have ever seen a movie as bad as this in my entire life. This movie makes gigli look like an OK movie. There isnt one funny moment in the entire movie it is basically all crappy acting mixed with crappy comedy. The only way you could possibly find this funny is if you are high or have an IQ lower then 30. Kim Kardashian and Carmen ELectras acting is so atrocious i actually kind of felt sick while watching it. I mean you would be way better off watching KIms sex tape cause at least its more entertaining then this movie. I highly advise everyone to not see this movie ever and try to get these to directors to never make another god awful movie again. Its kind of sad 2 grown men find this funny. PATHETIC	1
Dont even bother...	Canada	I just finished viewing Disaster movie on opening night. I came in with no expectations at all due to being tired of these spoof movies since Meet the Spartans, but I had to go in since I couldnt see Death Race. So when I was viewing this movie I really thought nothing could make me laugh. There were no character developments, there were no disaster movies spoofs(the only disaster things happening in the movie were meteors falling which were only 2 by the way). To tell you all the truth, I only chuckled once or twice(at the Juno parts). The rest of the jokes were either dumb, immature, or just recycled garbage from past movies.So to tell you all right now I have to say one thing about this movie: Dont see it, its no improvement from previous spoof mistakes.Rating: 1 out of 10	1
Who the hell says teens watch this?	United States	I wish this thing has a lower rating than one, this horrible excuse for a movie, deserves it over and over again. First off, these movies are NOT fueled by dumb teenagers foolish enough to watch them. Im 15 and even I know this is the biggest garbage ever. I dont watch these movies since Date Movie, because I learned right there that these movies suck. I went to a it with a friend and basically went to see how much it would suck. It sucked major ass. I walked out after a half-hour and hassled for my money back. When was the last time there even WAS a disaster movie? Juno, 10,000 B.C., Dont Mess With the Zohan, Indiana Jones, these are completely irrelevant, as are the hundreds of unfunny jokes ripped off the comedies they spoof (which is stupid as it is to spoof a comedy) and made them even less funny.Because of this movie, I will probably never watch MadTV again because it ruined my opinion of many of them. They give pathetic, poorly performed excuses for acting, and showed how horrendously unfunny they can be. (Its worse than when Tina Fey left SNL).If you want comedy, dont watch this, spoofing is an art, a talent few posses, and these two jack-weeds dont posses it AT ALL. If you want to see good comedy, go to the store and buy Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane!, Blazing Saddles, Spaceballs, Young Frankenstein, Scary Movie 3, and Superhero movie, because those movies are actually hilarious. Some less than others, but SM3 and SHM are far better than 10 Disaster Movies.So anyone who says that dumb adolescent teens fuel this garbage, think again because this stuff is garbage and I dont watch garbage. (this was an exception because people like my friend fuel this garbage :P.) This films will give you AIDS, makes you lose your hair, make you go blind, become flacid, makes you get a purple sock, this movie will destroy you and your sense of humor. Excuse the graphic descriptions, thats what it does to you, on the inside. DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. IF YOU DONT WATCH THIS, THOSE DUMBASSES WONT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS GARBAGE. THINK OF YOUR FUTURES! WHAT IF 80 MORE OF THESE FILMS ARE MADE WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE AROUND. THINK OF YOUR CHILDREN, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DONT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!	1
Not worth the admission	United States	Went to see it with a friend at the spur of the moment. I havent seen the other movies of this kind besides the first two Scary Movies. We ended up being the two oldest people in the theater (21 and 22). While the masses of preteens behind us laughed hysterically at the minute long belch session, I was exchanging horrified glances with my friend. It was pretty terrible. If you took a bunch of 6th graders together and told them to put together a skit in about 5 minutes, it would probably look something like Disaster Movie. The only moment we laughed was the chipmunk scene. Seeing them head-banging just seemed hilarious at the time, maybe because everything else leading up to it had been so mind-numbingly terrible. Its not worth the price of admission. The was one good thing about the movie though. The night felt so anti-climactic after that film, that we decided to go to Atlantic City and had a blast.	1
Oh my god, this does not look at all good.	United Kingdom	Now, this is review is just based off of the trailer, but still. I saw the trailer when I went to see get smart. Which I liked. But anyway from the same lame brained idiots who brought Date Movie, Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans comes Disaster Movie. Whats wrong with this movie? For a spoof film to have no satirical content and just have footage of superheroes flying into walls and various other stupidity. And what the hell is up with the Juno and sex in the city bit? That is without a doubt the weirdest bit in movie history do you really think the woman who wrote Juno is going to see her characters baby kick a woman in the face and go, oh I got burned. Also whats with the bikini girls running away from meteors? Thats just kind of sexist.The plot is ridiculously thin its just people avoiding meteors. Theres less plot than in Pee Wees adventure where he just loses a bike. Aaron Selzter and Jason Freidberg had better stop making movies because they are just wanting money.	1
Brings a new meaning to Disaster Movie	Mexico	READ THIS BEFORE YOU CONSIDER WATCHING DISASTER MOVIE: DONT. JUST DONT.Since I dont live in USA, there is absolutely no possibility for me to run across Friedberg or Seltzer. Because if I ever did, I will throw them whatever heavy object I have at my grasp right to their faces.Believe me when I say this. There is no way this piece of garbage (sorry for the comparison, garbage) can have any shred of wit, creativity or thought.Do not honor it with your attendance at a theater where it is actually shown (even if you get a free admission).Why, do you ask? What does this movie have that can be so bad? Well, it has everything and nothing at the same time. It has all the references (not parodies) of every single movie you have paid good money to see lately. Not just that, they try to make fun of Juno, a movie whose script by Diablo Cody is light years ahead of Selter and Friedbergs, and The Dark Knight, a movie that redeems the famed franchise. Schumacher made a genius portrayal of the Dark Cruzader compared to what said idiots have done. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was better than this. The whole nuke the fridge scene was smarter than any scene in Disaster Movie.It doesnt have any real craftsmanship whatsoever. The only likeliness this thing had to film-making or production was the basic presence of a camera and people in front of it (not necessarily actors). The jokes? Thats the joke: There are no jokes. More and more references to celebrities and big movies. And the main thing Disaster Movie is missing in the plot is... you guessed it! A disaster! I personally thought Meet the Spartans was going to be the end of this Spoof Movie era. But they made Superhero Movie, and now, Seltzer and Friedberg are back! Ahhh! The humanity! An advice to producers outside the Spoof Movie circle. If you want your movie to become a success, mention that Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer had nothing to do with it. Youll make millions (the only ones who wont see it are pre-teens that have never seen any real movie, and paid to see Date, Epic, Spartans and Disaster). I wouldnt say you should avoid it like the plague, because the plague is funnier, more enjoyable and has a better thought script than Disaster Movie. It doesnt even deserve to be voted upon.	2
I cant believe Im saying this, but this is even worse than Meet the Spartans	Long Beach, California	The writing of this movie is truly inventive. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have figured out how to make movies with no plots, based on movies they have only seen the trailers to, and these movies have such low budgets, that they still make money. Even with the low budget, they have an all star cast, full of bad Madtv actors, Carmen Electra and even the legendary Tony Cox. The acting, writing and direction all sparkle like the latrines of a diarrhea filled bathroom. This movie might be on par with Schindler&#x27;s List for the amount of laughs, or there lack of. Honestly, though, this movie is one of the most god awful things ever made. Even their last all time low Meet the Spartans was topped in terms of horrible writing and direction, and the current rating of a 1.3 shows that Mr. Friedberg, Mr. Seltzer and their other writing partner Satan can&#x27;t get much worse.Disaster Movie...what a title for this, considering not one Disaster Movie is spoofed. Every movie here is one that came out within the last year, many which came out after this piece of garbage was written, and not one of them was a disaster movie. I guess they did a parody of Twister with the cow falling, but being the geniuses these two gems of writers are, they probably haven&#x27;t seen Twister and just thought it would be funny to have a cow crush Iron Man. I was practically wetting my pants with some of this material. The Hulk&#x27;s pants fall off, then he&#x27;s hit by a cow. Duh, haha, duh, that&#x27;s some good stuff. I think the target audience of this movie must be two year old mentally unstable children, and even they would find the humor a bit too dumb and immature.Onto the plot of this winner. Will (Matt Lanter) has a dream that he&#x27;s in 10,001 B.C. and he fights the Wolf from American Galdiators and meets Amy Winehouse who burps for like ten minutes on him, then gives him the Crystal Skull. He wakes up to find his girlfriend, Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) is leaving him for Flava Flave and little man Jojo. He throws a super duper sweet sixteen, despite that he is 25, and then a High School Musical number goes on, and then Calvin (played by the wonderful G. Thang) tries to curve a bullet, then Carmen Electra gets in a battle with other beauty Kimberly Kardashian, then Junie sings, and then later Javier Bardem, Prince Caspian, Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf and a police officer are all played by Ike Barinholtz, and thousands of sub-plots and movie spoofs of every recent movie comes in.I must admit, I laughed more here than in Meet the Spartans. Meet the Spartans produced about .5 chuckles, where this in total produced maybe 1 chuckle out of stupidity. The laughs were obviously infrequent, considering there was only 1 in this 75 minute collage of badly reproduced movies. The acting is actually not too bad in comparison to Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie, but the overall enjoyment level of none was reduced to less than none. It&#x27;s sad movies like this could be made (let alone be called movies). This was the most awful putrid flick to ever appear on the big screen, and as long as it makes money, each year we will be treated to even worse movies from these swell writers and directors.Overall, this was not the best movie around, in fact, it was the worst. Avoid this at all costs. If it was a choice between this movie and death, it would be a tough choice.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 75 mins. PG-13 for stupid humor and poopoo mouth.	1
This movie actually made me angry...	Bay Area, California	Angry, in as so much as that I wasted my money, my time, and my intelligence. I could actually feel my brain cells die off while watching this atrocity. I would say that no one over the age of 11 should be let into this movie, but that would be an insult to 11 year olds. Dont bother to read for a synopsis, given that you would first need a plot in order to have a synopsis. Indeed, I think I have already put more thought and effort into writing this comment than those who wrote the movie put into the script; thats assuming there even WAS a script.I would give 0 stars, but I can only choose 1 as the lowest. Save your money... save your time... save YOURSELVES!!! Avoid this movie at all costs, and boycott anything else put out by these shameful creators.	1
Completely Horrible	United States	I went to the movies yesterday to see a movie. Unfortunately the movie I wanted to see wasnt showing. My ride had already left, so I figured that I should watch another. There werent that many available so I saw Disaster Movie.This movie is the worst piece of trash I have ever seen. It got to the point were I got a huge headache and completely mind numbed. I wanted to leave almost 5 times during the movies. The actors were horrible. I could play better roles handicapped and blind.This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I recommend you dont watch this movie at all. Youd be happier in the dark corner of your room by yourself while depressing music plays in the background.	1
Its been several months, and my review was inevitable...here goes...	United States	Jason Friedberg &#x26; Aaron Seltzer.I&#x27;m generally a defender of the mainstream, but these two....these two....They embody all that&#x27;s wrong with Hollywood, hell, with modern film in general. I hate when people defend them by saying they are satirizing films, they aren&#x27;t satirizing films THEY ARE REFERENCING films, they are not a mockery of crappy Hollywood excess, they are an EXAMPLE of it. It&#x27;s like if Michael Bay said his movies were meant to be a satire of excessive CGI and explosions. To do a parody or satire, you must PROVIDE or Impersonate examples of your topic and MOCK them over specific flaws and contradictions, you don&#x27;t COPY them and change things by adding hip-hop dance sequences or having characters die randomly. It&#x27;s clear they haven&#x27;t even watched the films that are &#x27;parodied&#x27; here, in fact, several of the films referenced were still being shot and in some cases only starting shooting, thus making effective parodies of those films impossible, and imagine for a moment if &#x27;Hancock&#x27; or &#x27;The Dark Knight&#x27; were never made and they still included references to those films, would you still consider that &#x27;hip&#x27; and &#x27;relevant&#x27;?.And even IF, pray tell, these films were funny, they are still off-topic. 99% of all the &#x27;jokes&#x27; have nothing to do with Disaster Movies and those that do are so minor they are negligible. FACT: You cannot parody something effectively if you don&#x27;t even mention it. Cut out the off-topic scenes from &#x27;Disaster Movie&#x27; for example, and you&#x27;ll only be left with 3, maybe 5 at the most, minutes of film, mostly credits. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s the funniest film in the world, if it doesn&#x27;t in some way deliver what it promises, I&#x27;m still not even gonna give it one star. If the titles were meant to be symbolic or something(like how &#x27;Dancing with Wolves&#x27; isn&#x27;t literally about dancing with wolves and Chris Ware&#x27;s &#x27;Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth&#x27; comic is about an adult with autism), it wouldn&#x27;t matter, but in this case, they specifically say what they are going to do, and then disappoint. And sure a lot of comedies have off-topic jokes, but NOT ONES THAT TAKE UP 98.9% OF THE WHOLE FILM! At least &#x27;Bio-Dome&#x27; actually took place in a Bio-Dome!So I apologize if you get off on being disappointed, sorry, but I&#x27;m not. I prefer to laugh when watching a comedy, or at least, have fun. And even worse, when they DO make actual parodies of something, they only do lame, obvious, predictable jokes even a small child could do just as effectively, if not more so. Oh, so Hannah Montanna&#x27;s a merchandising whore, WOW I didn&#x27;t know that!!! It&#x27;s like some kid who tries to seem smart at the dinner table when his parent&#x27;s are discussing politics by making political jokes, but who knows nothing about how politics work, so he just say&#x27;s &#x27;I&#x27;m a politician&#x27; and makes fart noises with his mouth. Is that cutting-edge and insightful satire? NO. But these idiots seem to think it is, because it&#x27;s basically what they do, only with &#x27;actors&#x27; doing it for them. My review for &#x27;Caltiki&#x27; is a better example of satire. And don&#x27;t call me a snob, because I&#x27;m a guy who loves stupid comedy, &#x27;Jingle all the Way&#x27; and &#x27;The Stupids&#x27; are some of my favorite guilty pleasures, hell, I started a thread about my favorite bad films a few months ago before some troll derailed it because I dared question the audacity of &#x27;Mystery Science Theatre 3000&#x27; and was recently involved in a flame war with some loser who thinks &#x27;South Park&#x27; is a sign of the coming Apocalypse.So don&#x27;t blame other people&#x27;s films, these are crap all on their own.And if they intend their films to be that way, that just makes it even worse, so they intend to make off-topic, unfunny, parody-devoid, boring, unpleasant films? That just confirms and justifies anything people say and do to them. Even assassination attempts. And if they really do consider their films to be real parodies, then they are one-trick ponies, and since plenty of comedians get grilled for doing a revolving door of the same few tricks,(like the Angry Video Game Nerd swearing too much and beating up guest stars, or Dane Cook being juvenile and unoriginal, although yeah, he is) then these two are the one trick-iest one trick ponies who ever lived, and their only trick is being off-topic.These films aren&#x27;t even entertaining in a so bad it&#x27;s good way, in fact, they are the antithesis of entertainment. I usually never listen to people who say they fell asleep watching a film, as I used to think that that was impossible and although I&#x27;ve done so, it was usually for a number of reasons such as being tired, drunk or forcibly on my own free will to escape a bad film. Well, it&#x27;s true, these film are so boring they actually will put you to sleep like a lazy student in a cartoon. In fact, if someone could have filmed me &#x27;watching&#x27; this garbage, I&#x27;m sure there would have been Z&#x27;s floating over my head.Ditch this crap, please.Oh, and for all of you out there who are going to castigate me for paying to see this, I&#x27;ll let you know I didn&#x27;t pay a single cent to watch this festering canker sore of a film. ~ The previous review will suffice for your Freidberg-Seltzer film of choice~	1
This Is Not The Worst Movie Of 2008. This Is The Worst Movie Ever.	United States	Disaster Movie is the 4th movie that has been made by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, this spoofs many blockbuster movies and pop culture figures of recent years. This time, the focus is on the disaster theme similar to The Day After Tomorrow.Since 2006, Jason and Aaron, who first met while working on Scary Movie, usually release one movie every year. This is actually the second movie they released this year.This is actually the second movie they released this year. At the beginning of this year in January, they did Meet the Spartans, which opened at #1 and spoofed the entire script of 300. I saw that film and thought that it was going to be the worst movie of the year.After seeing this one, I can say Disaster Movie is quite possibly the worst movie ever. I mean, it really is the worst movie ever made and released. You can put it straight to DVD or Blu-ray, and it still wouldnt be funny. You can air it as a made-for-TV movie, and it still wouldnt be funny. You can make it into a TV show pilot, and it still wouldnt get picked up. You can even get MAD TV canceled by including this as one of their skits.What throws the whole movie is that the jokes are continuous every 4 seconds and never have any humor. Every time you think they will forget something, they end up spoofing it. They actually try to spoof every movie made this year. And they even try to include every TV character and celebrity in their jokes. It just doesnt amuse, and it just doesnt quit. They really have no idea of when to quit.But the real reason why the jokes arent funny is that its inaccurate, overused, and butchered poorly. They spoof High School Musical with the main characters, and they poorly spoof Gabriella as a cheerleader, which she never was. They spoof Kung Fu Panda, an animated movie, using a robot panda that looks like a panda in the real world. The performance they did with Alvin and the Chipmunks will give you so many nightmares, you would rather the 2007 version over this movie. The idea to use a male actor to play Carrie Bradshaw in the Sex & The City spoof is too desperate, too obvious, and worst of all, so wrong. And the other jokes used have been used already in their other movies, used already in other spoof movies, and are too old to even try and would have been used at the appropriate time.This movie doesnt even spoof disaster films in general, unless if you can find any real Cloverfield spoofs. Some of the spoofs arent actually in the movie and rather used as promotional ads. All they try to do is give many films and A-list Hollywood stars the roasting they deserve. In reality, they destroy the parody film genre again and with more damage that a lot of people would rather stop making fun of them in movies like this. Normally, you can actually expect a film parody to be declared the worst movie ever by many people. But I guarantee that there is not and will not ever be a movie as worse as this one.	1
Well, at least it lived up to its name, Disastrous Movie or is it Disaster Movie, whichever one fits.	United States	This year Jason and Aaron pull out another movie from their repertoire of steamy crap, and I quoted movie because this thing is barely a movie. When I think of a movie I think of something that has a plot and characters, but this is some kind of unknown piece of work. A razzie wont do this film justice. But at least the razzie people now know who to give the award to. So bad it almost makes the other ones seem good.PROS:I have nothing good to say about this film. Absolutely nothing. CONS: my favorite part of this comment. The cons. OK first of all Aaron and Jason need to look up the definition of spoof in the dictionary, the definition might vary from a dictionary to another, but I am pretty sure no dictionary will give the following definition, a piece of work in which various objects fall on pop culture icons and random stuff with no synchronized manner happens. If a dictionary gives that definition to the word spoof then i stand corrected. For me parody movies are taking a little amount of a pop culture reference and expanding upon it and making original jokes such as airplane and scary movie and all those other movies which Aaron and Jason should have learned from. In this film, however, the genre diverts from a parody to wackness.99% of the jokes in this movie are prolonged and at some point you feel like you are being tortured. And then the unbearable redundancy. As if the audience like the jokes they already made in the film, they make other ones in the same manner. Where one of three things happens, something falling on someone, or somebody being hit brutally and somehow make it through, or somebody starting a random dance-off. The scene I hated the most, not that I liked any, is the scene where the chipmunks from Alvin and the chipmunks show up, and for some reason start chewing on Junos character(named Juney). The scene was somewhat disturbing and rubbish. everything in this film is a rip off. 95% of the characters are ripped off. the jokes are all rip-offs and it almost looked like an unscripted reality show, you know, where people do random stuff cause its not scripted.FINAL THOUGHTS: The saddest part is that these guys are making a living like this, I mean come on, there are talented actors and directors out there who are dying for roles and these guys are making a living by writing a script that looked like it took two hours or less to complete? unbelievable.Another thing, What is wrong with us human beings these days? I mean some people were actually laughing hysterically during the film, and I thought of the film Idiocracy, where people find this kind of stuff funny. I look forward to hating the next movie they are going to bring. I really do.	1
Abysmal	United States	It was...I mean...I just dont know what I can say. Anyone with a soul knows this thing is worthless.If you like things you know getting hit by other things you may or may not know. Popular culture references that are often not even that timely. And production quality that is on par with community college theater. If all of that stuff is what makes a movie good for you, still, STILL, dont watch this. Because it fails at failure.And a word to people who are into bad movie self-punishment. Just rent Troll 2, no one but the renter makes any money. And it doesnt give a false positive that someone watched this on purpose.	1
Oversaturated and corny.	United States	It seems that this type of movie died after the Wayans brothers stopped making the Scary Movies. Those movies were funny and didnt try to squash 20 movies in that didnt fit or relate. Scary Movie 1 was about Scream and Scary movie 2 was about House on Hunted Hill. These other movies could have been good if done right but these ( Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet The Spartans, Superhero Movie, and Disaster Movie ) were poorly executed, lazy, poorly written, and off topic.Distaster Movie could have been good if base off and idea in the genre like Twister,Cloverfield, or Day After Tomarrow. Also if it actually had funny and talented actors and writers.This movie only had one moment that made me laugh out loud just because I wasnt expecting it. That one moment was very brief as it was followed by Chucky Cheese like animatronic Chipmunks that ruined my one moment of joy in this cluster f of pop culture regurgitation that had no business being in the movie.I cant believe I paid to see this crap! After the movie I felt embarrassed and cheated.	1
A real disaster	United States	This movie was a real disaster. I cant remember the last time Ive been so disappointed to point of wanting a refund.Be warned,save your money. You may just want to wait until this movies airs on TV. I wouldnt recommend DVD either. A complete waste of money. You would think when they watched the finished project, that they realized then, we cant release this, it will not do well. I have no doubt this movie want be in theaters long. The local theater here is know for pulling movies that do not sale within the first three days of showing. The comedy in this movie was not good,it made no sense what so ever. The acting in some cases were very poorly executed.	1
Will Friedberg and Seltzer ever learn? I knew this was going to be horrible.	Kennesaw, GA	The only good thing about this movie is that it spoofs both High School Musical and Hannah Montana, two things which feel so out of character for Disney and two things that I just dont like, basically because both franchises are directed towards girls. Which is better? Movies that you dont like or really bad movies? Its hard to tell, because really bad movies are bad on their own. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be fired after making 4 bad movies in one career. At this rate theyll probably surpass Ed Wood for the most bad movies made by certain people or a single person. These guys just dont learn. All four movies they made: Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans, and this are all unfunny. Kids and teenagers are seeing this because of the commercials advertising this movie. I recommend you not going to see it and the agony booth recap for Epic Movie is funnier than this. It is located here: http://www.agonybooth.com/recaps/Epic_Movie_2007.aspx Man, they should stop this crap now! Weve seen too many unfunny spoof movies already.	1
What a waste	United States	Actually, a minus 10 would be more Apropro. THE worst asinine, most stupid movie I have ever seen. Wish I could get my money back! I will be sure to make note of the directors and will not put myself through the torture of watching another of their movies. You want ten lines? Ill give you ten lines....stupid, asinine, ignorant, gross, humorless, incongruent, plot less, objectionable, senseless, dopey, waste of time, waste of money, ripoff, fake, poor acting, more fun to watch grass grow, more fun to watch paint dry, so loud, you might as well leave your cell phone on.. as you couldnt hear it anyway. Maybe you get the point.. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even my enemies.	1
Parody is dead	United States	Once again that talentless duo that is Selzer and Friedberg show that they can sink lower than Meet The Spartans with this steaming waste of celluloid. I thought that Meet The Spartans scraped the barrel when it came to laughs but this cinematic abortion breaks through the bottom of the barrel to scrape the ground the barrel is on to get laughs and it still fails! These two chuckleheads still have the same bad habit of explaining the jokes to you as if you were retarded(if you liked this movie chances are you probably are retarded). For example if you have to explain to us what it is you&#x27;re making fun of like &#x22;Its an inconvenient truth, its global warming&#x22;, &#x22;Come here you Kung Fu Panda&#x22;, &#x22; I know because I saw Indiana Jones and The Kingdom Of the Crystal Skull&#x22;, &#x22;Let Me get my Get Smart phone&#x22;, &#x22; I thought I&#x27;d cheer you up with a high school musical&#x22;, What is this enchanted place&#x22; then you&#x27;re not really a genius but a racketeer that got by on the sheer stupidity of the average movie going public.You know for a movie titled Disaster movie, you would think that they&#x27;d be spoofing movies like Twister, Dante&#x27;s Peak, Volcano, The Day After Tomorrow right? WRONG. The camera shakes a couple of times, You see some cheesy plastic asteroids, a couple of cows floating around and a very crummy CGI tornado. The movie targets films like Juno, Alvin and The Chipmunks, Superbad, High School Musical, Step Up, Enchanted, Kung Fu Panda, The Dark Knight and a slew of other summer blockbuster flicks including, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk and Hancock. Now tell me, what do these movies have to do with disaster movies? Nothing.Nobody in this movie does anything that resembles acting and its safe to say that this &#x22;movie&#x22; is 100% laugh free. None of the &#x22;jokes&#x22; work and they just drag on for minutes at a time. Seltzer and Freidberg are unfunny hacks that killed a once funny genre with their grave dead brand of humor. If you want a good parody stick with Scary Movie(the first one), Top Secret, Duck Soup, Johnny Dangerously, Airplane, Not Another Teen Movie, Mafia!, Baseketball, Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Spaceballs, Blazing Saddles, Spaced Invades, Hot Shots(part one and Part Deux), The Naked Gun Series, Don&#x27;t Be A Menace, Im Gonna Git You Sucka, Last Action Hero(yeah, I said it), UHF, CB4, Hollywood Shuffle, Dead Men Don&#x27;t Wear Plaid and every other spoof that came before the advent of Scary Movie 3. Disaster Movie is complete and utter garbage that even those brainless yokels that come on Jerry Springer wouldn&#x27;t find funny(yes, its THAT bad). Do not waste another dollar on these idiotic circus clowns (Seltzer and Freidberg)and their lame parodies. To the people that gave this movie positive reviews, pat yourselves on the back. You are responsible for the decline of quality in American Cinema. Parody is dead and Aaron Seltzer and Jason Freidberg are the undertakers.Rest in Peace Parody 1933-2008	1
The Perfect Title	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil	In general, parody movies are entertaining and recommended when the viewer is upset, expecting to shutdown the brain and laugh with silly jokes. That was my expectation with when I selected Disaster Movie on DVD this Friday. Unfortunately this flick is AWFUL and I was incapable of laughing during the long 88 minutes running time. With the due respect the retards deserve, the directors and writers of this crap certainly have mental or education issues (or both), and I can not imagine how someone sane can produce and put money in this terrible production. The only thing that works perfectly is the original title of this disastrous flick. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Super-Her&oacute;is, A Liga da Injusti&ccedil;a (Superheroes, The League of the Injustice)	1
Spoof? I think not.	United States	I dont think Ive ever seen a worst piece of mindless drivel in my entire life. I liked the Scary Movie films, dont get me wrong. They had some intelligent jokes, and left you to wonder which movie they were spoofing. Then came the outright spoof films: Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Superhero Movie, Epic Movie, etc. They started making fun of films far more popular and far more creative then they could ever hope to be. The movie is full of Mad TV rejects and dropouts that the writers/directors have given sub-par jokes/gags to. The bottom line is this movie is an insult to your intelligence, and an insult to the movies they spoof. I think that Failburg and Seltzerwater (I personally like their name change, thanks to another writer on here) need to go back and watch some real spoof movies like Space Balls, or Monty Python: Search for the Holy Grail, even Robin Hood: Men In Tights or Naked Gun. I will tell you this, I walked out of the movie after about 30 minutes. I got tired of seeing movies that were clearly better than any of the movies by these two jokers will ever be get dragged through the dirt with stupid, ill-written, badly performed, mindless comedy. Its clear that the writers and directors of this movie have severe ADD and have an IQ of about 30, which is what youll need to actually enjoy this movie. Please avoid this movie at all cost, it only perpetuates the myth that Failburg and Seltzerwater are actually funny.	1
As you might expect, terrible.	United States	It would be easy for someone to point fingers at this movie and say it would be terrible even before the trailer came out based on the fact that it was done by those two guys who made such crapshoots as Date Movie, Epic Movie, and the latest, Meet the Spartans. Then the trailer came out, giving us more of a reason to hate it.And as you might expect, it was terrible. I think my reasoning for seeing this movie was because I had nothing else to do and I wanted something to make fun of. This movie is so frustratingly bad that you really dont feel a desire to make fun of it. It doesnt deserve it. There is clever funny, there is stupid funny, and there is ridiculous funny. This movie just isnt funny. It is just annoying. It just parodies the summers movies in a way that is just annoying. Iron Man, Indiana Jones, whatever. It wasnt funny.Just stay away. You probably already knew that but if you feel like you have nothing else to do as I did, trust me, staring at a wall is better. You will come out angry and upset that anyone would actually be stupid enough to make a film this atrocious.	1
why? just why	new york city	why bother another one another one please stop why cant these people give it a break and why Hollywood just stop making movies period if were going to have an other one why cant they be a good director as the other directors out there Im surprised these guys even get lay ed. this movie will be forgotten right away after this 2 weeks why would they do this to them self are u going to show Ur kids that this what u made in Ur time Ur wrong they will hate u and they will never make friend cause of this this they did anything to put in 90 minutes but why. i feel like throwing up it would be better then watching this movie again please dont watch this movie the title says it all for crying out loud. stop this please dont even buy the DVD u people suck	1
A crime against humanity	United States	Anyone who supports the creation of the intellectual equivalent of sewage by paying to see this movie should be charged with a crime against humanity. Freedom of speech and all, but theres no redeeming quality to these films.I dont know why IMDb requires 10 lines of text to post a comment. I really said all I needed to say in the first paragraph. And everybodys said the same thing here - that these movies arent even parodies. Theyre regurgitations. Of course, all of us here know that, so it must be a different audience who keeps going. If its young uns who are going, I may need to consider moving to another country before they reach adulthood. Of course, they could scarcely do worse steering our country than the 50.1% of Americans who returned W. to office in 2004. Put those two phenomena together (the last 8 years and the popularity of these films) and I think we can officially call it sunset on the American Empire. Seriously. These movies are that bad. They shine light on the barren wasteland that is the interior of our populaces skulls.	1
Really, Who Gives A F**k	None	That&#x27;s probably what the directors said when making this movie, though that should come as no surprise to anyone at this point. Once again Friedberg and Seltzer have teamed up to drive countless moviegoers to suicide with a new cinematic monstrosity the likes of which haven&#x27;t been seen since The Garbage Pail Kids Movie.The acting is terrible. I have no idea who any of these actors are (I refuse to acknowledge Kim Kardashian as an actress after all the awful things SHE&#x27;S put out) but pretty much any hope they&#x27;ve ever had of a career was more or less destroyed by this movie. I&#x27;m still baffled that Tim Curry managed to survive Scary Movie 2.The plot... There is no plot. There is no story. There is no CONFLICT. It&#x27;s just a group of stupid kids going around ripping off every single movie made in recent years (at the time of its release) while tornadoes and other disasters strike the area.I wish a tornado had struck this movie during production...And remember how previous Seltzer and Friedberg movies had &#x22;parodied&#x22; genre films (if you&#x27;re using the definition of someone who doesn&#x27;t know what parody is)that they were named after? Of course not, seeing as like me you&#x27;ve tried to pretend these movies never existed up to this point, but humor me on this. The title itself is a complete lie, holding no ties to the genre from which it takes its name other than being a complete disaster in and of itself.Consider this my review for ALL Seltzer and Friedberg movies: they&#x27;re all a huge pile of cinematic fodder that should be cremated, buried and forgotten and their creators kicked out of Planet Earth.	1
Never has a movie had a More Appropriate Title!	United Kingdom	Having seen the Scary Movie Series and many of the other works by this group of stars and Directors, my hopes for laughs were low...But even i could not have predicted how bad this really would be...Within the first 10 Minutes, we see possibly the WORST Amy Winehouse Look Alike EVER in one of the most UNFUNNY Movie Moments ever created... I was never a fan of Miss Winehouse, but dear god - How could anyone find this parody of her even remotely funny?It seems that the Directors have now reached a pinnacle since the first ideas they ever had... Scary Movie was Rude and Crude and Broke Barriers - It was funny...... Where this movie is like Epic Movie, Just plain CRUDE! So Crude that it is NOT FUNNY - END OF!I watched it simply because it was on the TV... I am damn glad I never saw it at the Cinema or wasted my money buying the DVD...There is an ART to doing PARODY... Being Crude is Great but only if you can do so with Intellect...These people need to take a step back and look at the works of the Wonderful Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder and many more... They may be old and their humour may not match the new generation, but they had a class that made it work and made it funny!Face it Fellas... You have no class... And trying to be crude when you have no class means you are just plain crude... And that means you FAIL!How would I rate this Movie? Sadly, We cannot do Minus ratings... So My honest view is I don&#x27;t... Not even ONE STAR... But to submit my review I need to add one... And thats all it is getting!	1
This movie is a full crime.	South Korea	My friend said &#x27;never watch this movie. It sucks it hurts your eyes and it&#x27;s bad for your brain&#x27;. He said this movie was the second worst film he ever saw. Because of the fact that my friend watched like thousands of films, I was a little afraid to watch this movie. Unfortunately, My curiosity won my worries. After I decided to watch this movie, my friend told me about a hundred times not to watch this movie. But I was to curios. Then last Sunday while my friend was watching the Simpson, I watched this film. Before I start this review, let&#x27;s go over some types of movies. The first one is a movie that&#x27;s so good, you can hardly say anything after you watched it. Second: great, but not as good as the first one. Third: just good, forth: harmless, fifth: bad, sixth: very bad, seventh: a trash, and the last type: a movie that is used for torturing. This movie is used for the worst torture the humans has ever made.I should have listen to my friend. This movie was a total disaster. I should have known that when I saw the title. This movie starts with some not-funny slapstick and a Cristal skull.(Yeah I know it sounds familiar but let&#x27;s just go through it). It&#x27;s something about &#x27;if you don&#x27;t place the Cristal skull back in it&#x27;s place then the world will come to an end&#x27;. Yeah really great plot. Let&#x27;s give a medal for it. So anyway, this person name Will breaks up with his girlfriend and celebrates his sixteen year-old party....... even though he&#x27;s not. Here, High School Musical comes out of nowhere and it&#x27;s worst than the original. Think about it, worst version of high school musical. Than the story suddenly turns into save Will&#x27;s girlfriend and Will meet&#x27;s all kinds of characters. Here comes some great shocks like BATMAN IS FLEEING, CARRYING A SUITCASE. I am dead serious batman is fleeing, carrying a suitcase. Not satisfied? How about this? Ironman and Hulk gets defeated by a cow and so does Hellboy. Juno gets killed by Elvin and the chipmunks who are really monsters, Kung Fu Panda is a man wearing a mask, Hancok is some guy drinking, Giselle is eating glass bottles, and Indiana Jones is an old man who is really really short. There are some other characters but I don&#x27;t want to talk about them right now. No don&#x27;t cry yet, because there is one last thing: a song on the last scene. Which is a song that I like to call f**k song. I&#x27;m not giving this name because the song is bad. I&#x27;m giving this name because THE SONG IS ABOUT F**KING. I&#x27;m not lying. There is a song like this. This song is.........terribly horribly, horridly, disastrously, painfully, sickly, awful. I&#x27;ll tell you this. Batman is playing the guitar. Okay? I repeat, Batman is playing the guitar.Maybe there is a bad movie that you should watch or maybe there is a movie that&#x27;s so bad that it&#x27;s funny. But this film is not one of those films it cannot be one of those films. My friend caught a cold right after he saw this movie and so have I. This movie is just.........awful. No, awful isn&#x27;t the right word. There is not word in this whole universe that can describe this movie. Don&#x27;t watch this it&#x27;s bad for your brain, your eyes, your ears, your mind, and yourself.	1
Whoever gave this film the green light...should be arrested	United States	because he actually got the red light and thought it was green.See what happens when you democratize a medium and make it available to everyone. I mean, give someone a bunch of 35mm film stock, a Panavision camera and 25 million bucks, some hot chicks and dorky guys and they think that they can make a movie.Movies like this are good though!Because they can&#x27;t get any worse! And set the Jerry Springer crap bar even lower.The plot is as thin as Kate Moss and the brain dead humor is lifeless even with real people saying the lines.Just think, 25 million dollars could have: saved some turtles, fed some people, provided shelter for others, helped Red Cross, built houses in New Orleans, kept in the bank to load out to people needing money, provided 25 good filmmakers with a million bucks each, kept Leslie Nelson alive for a few more years, and could provide a dollar each for some 25 million people.	1
Please, burn this	United States	This movie falls into the very rare category of films that are an example of &#x22;what NOT to do.&#x22; The plot is 100% muddled (makes no sense whatsoever). Try to imagine an episode of Family Guy with no plot, just one incomprehensible comedy clip after the other--that is Disaster Movie in a nutshell.The only question is &#x22;Do you want the aspirin before or after you see this?&#x22; Please take my advice and don&#x27;t keep watching hoping it will get better -- it won&#x27;t! Just save your brain cells for a night of binge drinking or heavy metal music. Damaging your brain on those will be less painful. I hope everyone who saw it in the theater walked out and demanded a refund.Yes, it&#x27;s that bad...I can&#x27;t even think of how to describe it...I just watched it and my head hurts so bad I have to cut this review short to get aspirin...later.	1
Poor	Australia	horrendous!!! I didn&#x27;t laugh once during the entire movie. Save yourself 80 minutes! Give it a miss. Sadly I have to make up 10 lines about this movie. The movie does not deserve 10 lines but here we go anyway. I watched the superhero movie and that was funny, this was just not even worth a chuckle. I found this movie disjointed and it just basically struggled. I would be interested to know if anyone found it remotely funny. I gave it a 1, but it should be minus 10. I first saw the unbelievably hot Vanessa Minnillo in the TV show &#x22;True Beauty&#x22; and thought that she was pretty good in that. It is hard to believe that she went from the host of a TV reality show giving a good performance and then blew her credibility out the window by actually agreeing to participate in this garbage. I knew that this movie was going to blow by the four minute mark but I persisted with it hoping that it would get better or I would get a chuckle every now and then - but no - FAIL!!! The most ironic part of my day was that i watched a movie called Harpies - and that was worse! I think I have pi**ed Karma off, and I don&#x27;t know what I have done wrong!! ha ha ha	1
Why.....?	United States	I had been almost certain that this was going to be better than &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22; but after I watched this, I actually thought about watching Meet the Spartans again. This movie was an EPIC fail! I don&#x27;t know what gives people the idea that we actually want MORE of these types of movies. They all pretty much fail. Scary Movie was entertaining but once they had made things such as Date Movie and Epic Movie, It all began to suck! I read though other comments and I saw a majority of people agreeing that this movie blows! I would NEVER even think about THINKING to recommend this movie to another person. Even taking the time to look at the back of the DVD case would be a waste of time! In conclusion of my review, I recommend that NO ONE picks up this movie. I don&#x27;t think even an 8 year-old could find any enjoyment of this film. ***DON&#x27;T WATCH IT!***	1
Havent we seen this sort of film 1479 times already?!  And, it was funnier the other 1478 times.	Bradenton, Florida	This film begins in 100001 BC and we see a caveman fall into a pile of Wooly Mammoth crap. Then, he&#x27;s attacked by a guy who looks like he&#x27;s from &#x22;American Gladiators&#x22; and then an Amy Winehouse look-a-like with fangs. Then he awakens and a Flavor Flav lookalike is in bed with him and his girlfriend in the present. Shortly after this, a dwarf exits the bed and gives the leading man the finger. While parody is supposed to be silly, these images are so random you wonder if the film was written or they just too darts and threw them at story ideas--all very, very fast and all which fell completely flat--and many of which were just very, very crude to hide that it wasn&#x27;t funny. And this, in a nutshell, is what follows for the next 90 or so minutes--one supposed parody after another after another--none of which made me laugh.Here are my suggestions should they want to make another &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; or something like it: 1. Less jokes and slow down so you have time to work out the parodies. Quantity is NOT better than quality. Yet, at other times, unfunny skits go on and on and on and on and they had neither quantity nor quality. The Hannah Montana and &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; bits were beaten like dead horses.2. Hire professional writers, not squirrels. I know they work cheap, but humor is NOT their forte.3. Jokes about performing abortions with coat hangers aren&#x27;t funny. The film DID this and I am sure the entire theater when deadly silent. Like cancer and 9-11, this is NOT a good topic for comedy.4. Jokes involving dwarfs can work, but generally not. Unless you can get Mini-Me, don&#x27;t bother.5. Find talented actors and people who really can do parodies. It would also help if they vaguely look like the subject of the parody. Some did, many did not (like Hannah Montana).6. &#x22;I just s#%$ myself&#x22; is not a particularly funny line. Avoid it.7. Same goes for &#x22;suck on my placenta&#x22;. Not funny.8. Keep the &#x22;Enchanted&#x22; stuff--it&#x27;s not great but compared to the rest of the film, it&#x27;s gold. Just shorten it A LOT--this skit went on way too long and became 100% stupid. In fact, it was only funny for about 30 seconds. 9. If you&#x27;re gonna use a lot of actors from &#x22;Mad TV&#x22;, try to get the more talented ones.10. No poop jokes. Poop is not comedy gold. Poop is just poop.11. No &#x22;Kunk Fu Panda&#x22;. No.12. Get rid of Alvin and the Chipmunks unless you are willing to spend more than $13 for the puppets.13. Keep Beowulf--one of the only funny characters in the film who stayed funny throughout. He came late in the movie, though, and by then I am sure most of the patrons left the theater or killed themselves.14. And, speaking of kill--kill the director, producers, writers and all the actors. I&#x27;m not sure if this is legal, but I assume most judges and juries would allow this if they saw the film.	1
Worst movie of the decade,worst parody movie ever.	Canada	Wow...well i saw this movie not too long ago and its hard to imagine someone actually finding the strength to hold in all they&#x27;re anger after spending even a penny on this piece of royal crap,I at first had no idea what to expect from this i thought it was going to be another parody film but this time about i guess disaster movies like maybe twister,volcano, or maybe &#x27;the day after tomorrow&#x27; or something but instead all we saw where a bunch of seriously disastrous attempts to make humour out of some of 2008&#x27;s best movie events like dark knight and Indiana Jones,and randomly Alvin and the chimp mucks..okkk,the entire movie was pointless and the protagonists where boring as hell,and at some times looked as though they knew they were committing a crime for being soo bad but tried anyways to make the audience laugh but then fail again and make me twice as angry.I don&#x27;t personally know anyone else who saw this movie except the people i was with when i saw it,but i never actually talked face to face with anyone else about it and i have no questions as to why,this movie should never have been in theatres or even directed at-all,other then maybe in someones basement on a cheap webcam by a guy who had nothing else to do and was probably high!...then erased	1
Worst Movie Ever!	Canada	Easily the worst movie of all time! Not much more can be said. I can&#x27;t even begin to understand how any sort of time or effort was put forth into making this film a reality. Every joke was fail and absolutely nothing about this movie made me laugh in the slightest.I will never get this time back, but what bothers me more than that is the fact that I could have used my own hand-held camera to make something better than this. Hell give me a 1000 budget I could make something 10x better than this absolutely disgusting piece of trash.Anybody who reads this view on the movie or any others similar don&#x27;t even take a peek at this movie to see if it really is this bad. Just take peoples word for it and do something better with your life. I personally would have rather endured episodes of Barney and Friends.	1
Id thought Id never see the day when Id see something worse than Home Alone 4, but with this monstrosity, it just goes to show how much I could be proved wrong.	United Kingdom	Disaster Movie gets my vote as the &#x22;new&#x22; worst movie ever made, and there have been abominations like Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat and NeverEnding Story 3, but none of them are as terrible as this, and that is saying something. I thought Disaster Movie crude, lazy and looming towards offensive, (what they said about Amy Winehouse was bang out of order) and some of the repeated gags wore well thin before the first attempt was finished. The script was laughable, the writers display no comedic talent and there is a complete lack of laughs, and I am sorry I found the characters very annoying, Giselle especially. The acting was terrible, in all my life, I have never seen such terrible acting, and believe me, I have seen a lot of films with terrible acting. Matt Lanter and Vanessa Minillo were not only given next to nothing to work with, likewise with Tony Cox, but their performances went nowhere. Everyone else was bad too, especially Carmen Electra, whose career I am surprised isn&#x27;t over yet, in every film she&#x27;s in, she shows a complete lack of acting ability. The film looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, and even the soundtrack was awful. Plus the title was completely irrelevant, very rarely did it spoof a disaster movie, all it did was try and be funny and failed miserably. Not even the characters spoofed here like Batman, the Chipmumks(a gross ditortion in character and more disturbing than cute and funny) and Hellboy could save this contemptible piece of excrement(I am trying to refrain from swearing, honestly I was seriously considering turning the DVD player off 20 minutes into the movie). My dad and brother told me it was very stupid, but unlike them, I am 17 by the way, I didn&#x27;t find it entertaining in the least bit. If you want a good spoof try the silly but otherwise hilarious Loaded Weapon 1! Avoid this thing at all costs! I rest my case, 0/10. Bethany Cox	1
An Honest Review....	Canada	Anyone going into this film would automatically assume it would suck. The other films in the ______ Movie franchise have been garbage. Ladies and gentlemen, Disaster Movie is different.The film is so funny and spot on with the spoofs that I almost died from laughter. All the actors turn in near perfect parodies of their characters. I actually thought I was watching Juno and her baby fight Sarah Jessica Parker from Sex And The City. The guy who played Hancock could be a twin for Will Smith, that is how good he is. He channel the Hancock character so well that I thought I was watching the Hancock sequel.The film is so witty and on the spot with it&#x27;s comedy, it feels natural. So natural that there probably was no script. With a film like this, the joke write themselves. Throw whatever story you want in because it&#x27;s the comedy here that works. On second thought, the story works too. It&#x27;s leap and bounds over films that have been Oscar nominated. The story centre&#x27;s around these people and a crystal skull and some disaster that happens. Everything about it works.The fight scenes are phenomenal. G. Thang plays a character called Calvin, he has a fight scene with a real life panda. Or at least I thought it was a real life panda, the animatronics and special effects in this film will rival Avatar, and it came out a year before it!!! Take that James Cameron. The fight between the two is so well choreographed that it makes Jackie Chan and his stunts look like child&#x27;s play.The film has so many unexpected events. Who knew that a meteorite would come crashing down on Kim Kardashian. I sure didn&#x27;t. Speaking of Kim, she is more than just another pretty face. She was channeling something else here, I think she must have been in character for months before and after this film, because it is just too phenomenal. Daniel Day Lewis should be offering her his Oscar, that&#x27;s how good she is.Ike Barinholtz, of MADtv fame, pulls an Eddie Murphy and a Mike Myers, by playing multiple roles. His range is out of this world. Who else could be able to pull off Hellboy, Batman, Beowulf, a police officer and Javier Bardem look a like, and Prince Caspian. I can only think of one man...and that is Ike Barniholtz.I can&#x27;t stop recommending this film. It&#x27;s what the movies and film and cinema is all about. I wish I could watch it everyday for the rest of my life. Which is why I&#x27;m giving this the absolute best rating I can possibly give a film like this.	1
I Lost Almost 90 Minutes Of My life...	Bulgaria	Very few laughs, bad acting, writing and directing-what else can I say-I know that was actually the director&#x27;s goal, but that sick?! Every time when a movie like this comes out, a &#x22;.... Movie&#x22; I watch it, but I don&#x27;t know why anymore-Epic Movie was fine most of the time, had it&#x27;s laughs, Date Movie wasn&#x27;t even half as good as Epic, but this... huh, maybe it&#x27;s the right time to stop-the success of the Scary Movie franchise was big, but here I can&#x27;t see the fun anymore-I watched it, despite the fact I didn&#x27;t want to, and I felt sorry.I felt sorry for me, for the cast and crew and even for the director, who&#x27;s winning, I don&#x27;t know, maybe 3 or 4 times in a row the worst director of the year award.The movie isn&#x27;t capable of delivering the laughs, and this means all is lost, because those movies were all about them-the plot is...well there isn&#x27;t one, because they&#x27;re parodies and there&#x27;s nothing left...The last 10-15 minutes weren&#x27;t that bad, but that&#x27;s all(by not that bad I mean 4-5/10 not more), everything else was crappy and garbage.2/10 for those few minutes and for a couple of decent laughs.	2
Overindulgent, sophomoronic, throwaway crap.	United Kingdom	Something rather peculiar happened today whilst watching the third (yes, count em, third) lethargic spoof movie of this year alone; something bizarre and surreal, and quite unlike anything that I have experienced before: I didnt laugh. Yes, thats right, no once, not a guffaw, not a smirk, smile or one instantaneous moment of amusement; nothing but agonising pain soared through my bones when watching this production line slice of spoof comedy regurgitated on screen from the liquefied brains of hack writers Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Spearheaded with tired, overdone writing; predictably crass, shallow characters; a meaningless, lobotomised plot; mundane dialogue; dull, lazy, downright childish humour; lacklustre performances and the production value of a shoestring, Disaster Movie did eventually manage to provoke one moment of joy; when it was all over and I realised I could go home, far far away from the evil torture that had just unfolded in front of me.Like its inept predecessors, this latest offering from dud-duo Friedberg and Seltzer has the writers rummaging through all of this years biggest movies in search of something, no, anything to poke fun at in a demeaning manner as if these two actually know what theyre talking about. From Iron Man to Sex and the City, Juno to 10,000BC, Disaster Movie takes time to incorporate a lot of titles into its murky waters to try and get a laugh from someone, no, anyone, and its this transparent, kitschy appeal that eventually leaves the movie feeling lacking any value or substance. The saddest thing about the feature however lies in scenes where the writers go out of their way to directly and overtly mock several movies, yet in doing so end up making more of a mocking statement about themselves than of their targets.This misstep most firmly resonates during the many instances where Diablo Codys Juno script is called into question by the writers, spoofing its quirky, culturally referential dialogue and trying to pass it on as pretentious and overwritten of all things. Of course, instead of achieving what any decent spoof does in managing to make you laugh at a movie even if you enjoyed it, Disaster Movie instead only achieves in demeaning itself to point of embarrassment. Throughout the feature I couldnt help but feel that maybe if Jason and Aaron spent as much time on their script as Diablo obviously did, then maybe, just maybe theyd manage to make people laugh rather than ask for their money back. The writers try to create laugh out loud parody, and they seem to think theyre pretty good at it too, but, much like a bloated star, Disaster Movie ends up collapsing into itself under its own gravitational pull of overindulgent, sophomoronic, throwaway crap, resulting in a black hole void of any light, or signs of life.Of all the forms of comedy, the spoof is probably the easiest way in which to deliver a joke; its stand-up comedy on the big screen, joke after joke with little reliance on substantial narrative. So it goes without saying that even with such misgivings for any sort of coherent, well thought-out plot, and lacking any compelling, memorable characters whatsoever, as far as dumb spoof movies go, it should still be able to make you laugh regardless. Yet even here the movie goes in the completely wrong direction. Friedberg and Seltzers earlier effort this year was similar; it was stupid and inept at telling any sort of meaningful tale, but it at least delivered some moments of laughter. Here however we have references slapped in lazily, all of which feel suspiciously like theyve be written up after having seen the trailer, and not the full movie; there are no moments of relevancy and the writing constantly feels lazy and unremarkably indistinct from everything else. Often jokes will be dragged on and on incessantly and infuriatingly to the point where the initial disappointment of another bum-note turns into a cacophony of middling annoyance. Take for example an early jab at Hannah Montana (I wonder if anyone who goes to see this will have even seen her movie), as it is presented once, repeated again, and again and again; it isnt funny the first time and it certainly doesnt get any better from there on in. Then theres the same formula used with slapstick violence, and a caricature Amy Winehouse burping over and over like its meant to be hilarious. No, it really isnt.Often I will find it hard to adequately review a comedy movie simply due to the fact that humour is one of the most subjective forms of entertainment there is. Yet leaving Disaster Movie and overhearing comments of how it was alright followed by the brave conclusions of but, it wasnt very funny, I knew I wasnt alone. Indeed I would be surprised to find even the most immature, brain-dead of audiences enjoying this; I laughed at Superhero Movie, I laughed at Meet the Spartans&#133; hell, I think I even cracked a smile during Epic Movie, but I didnt do anything during Disaster Movie. Theres something to be said about a comedy that doesnt even raise one moment of laughter, never mind a spoof movie such as this which puts all of its chips on the line just to deliver the jokes. A perfect example of the market having a greater say over substance, Disaster Movie is a disaster, and the biggest catastrophe of the year.- Written by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)	1
I now know I had a soul, for I felt it die...	United States	This movie, along with Epic Movie, Date Movie, and Meet the Spartans, are pure trash. I love bad movies like Plan 9 and Manos, but they are not merely bad. They are cinematic abortions. These movies dont seem to be even trying to amuse me. It feels like theyre personally insulting me.On a side note, a previous comment stated that this movie is on par with Schindlers List in laughs. That is a lie. Schindlers List, while a serious and tragic film, had some funny parts. For example, the scene where Oscar Schindler is looking for a secretary. Each secretary is more attractive and a worse typist than the last, and Oscar (a notorious womanizer) keeps leaning in more and more. Then it cuts to a homely woman typing really fast and Oscar leaning as far away as possible. So he hires all of them. That is funny.If you had to list a movie on par with Disaster Movie in terms of laughs per movie, I would compare it to Salo: or The 120 Days of Sodom. However, Salo, disturbing as it is, is art with social messages. This Epically Disastrous Spartan Date franchise has no redemptive properties whatsoever.	1
Disaster Movie Is A Disaster!	United States	Disaster Movie lives up to its title. The latest lowbrow movie lampoon from the writing and directing duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer qualifies as their least imaginative burlesque of blockbuster movies. Friedberg and Seltzer contributed jokes for the last two Scary Movies. Afterward, they ventured out on their own and their first and third spoofs Date Movie (2006) and Meet the Spartans (2008) fared better than their lamentable sophomore effort Epic Movie(2007). The theatrical movie poster shows a tidal wave swamping the Statue of Liberty. Nothing as large-scale as a tidal wave engulfs Disaster Movie. When the earthquake strikes, Friedberg and Seltzer do little more than wobble their cameras to simulate cataclysmic events.The best Friedberg & Seltzer parodies single out a specific movie and flesh out the fun with gags from other movies that have nothing to do with the narrative. Date Movie, for example, ribbed the romantic Will Smith comedy Hitch, while Meet the Spartans skewered the homoerotic spear & sandal saga 300. Ostensibly, Disaster Movie appropriates the Cloverfield plot, but omits everything else plot that distinguished Cloverfield. Disaster Movie doesnt consist of first-person video footage recovered from a camcorder. Friedberg & Seltzer have no Godzilla-type monster trampling the city. The humor consists of diametrically opposite characters colliding with each other as mobs of panic-stricken people swarm the streets amid chaos. Sexual and scatological jokes brimming with PG-13 profanity and partial male nudity seem rather tame because after four movies bowel noises lack hilarity.Disaster Movie opens with a dream. The protagonist, Will (Matt Lanter of Heroes), dreams that the year is 10,001 B.C. This is a clear reference to the prehistoric potboiler 10,000 B.C. Will imagines that he is a caveman with dreadlocks and a rampaging dinosaur is chasing him. Our hero dodges a gigantic dinosaur foot as it pulverizes the ground nearby. Instead, he plunges headlong into a pile of dino poop. Afterward, he encounters a saber-toothed, alcoholic Amy Winehouse (Nicole Porter of Mad TV) with her bizarre beehive hairdo. Winehouse conjures up a Mac laptop from her beehive. She forecasts the end of the world on August 29, 2008. An alarmed Matt awakens from his nightmare. He discovers two more guys--a tattooed midget and Public Enemy rapper Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) in the raw--in his bed between him and his cute girlfriend Amy. Amy (Vanessa Minnillo of The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer) walks out on Will with the midget because he refuses to commit to her. Actually, Wills obsession with the end of the world prevents him from committing to Amy.Later, at the sweet sixteen party he never had, twenty-five year old Will and his friends are shaken by earthquake tremors originating near the loft where they are partying. Amy leaves the party to check on the National Museum where she works. Will and his Fat Albert best friend Calvin (newcomer Gary G-Thang Johnson) rush into the streets to witness widespread panic. A pregnant teenager, Juney (Crista Flanagan of Mad Men), the spitting image of Ellen Page in Juno, a movie about a wisecracking, knocked-up teenager, joins them. Flanagan gets some of the best lines in Disaster Movie. The closest thing to a catastrophe in Disaster Movie are the smoking vapor trails that huge green meteors make as they streak across the sky. One meteor pins Hannah Montana (Crista Flanagan again) to the ground, but she continues to sing and advertise her wares.Meanwhile, an Enchanted princess (Nicole Parker) emerges from a street man-hole and accompanies our heroes across town to the Natural Museum where an Egyptian statue has Amy pinned to the floor. Like the Clovenfield heroes, our heroes find shelter in an abandoned building. First, they encounter a look-alike Sex and the City quartet. Juney and a transvestite version of Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie (Jason Boegh of First Kiss) tangle like vicious cats. Juney kicks Carrie not only with her own feet but also with the feet of her unborn baby. Second, our heroes encounter pugnacious animatronic, sweatshirt-clad chipmunks like those from Alvin and the Chipmunks. Predictably, one chipmunk turns rabid and takes a chunk out of Wills crotch. Eventually, Will, Calvin, the Princess, and Juney reach the museum and release Amy. Amy produces the crystal skull from Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. In the second best joke, we see Indianas fedora on the floor and the shadow of the famous adventurer scooping it up. This time little man Tony Cox, the midget who played singles counselor Hitch in Date Movie, fills in for Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.Unfortunately, Friedberg & Seltzers fourth movie amounts to little more than amateur high school skits. They love humiliating celebrities. The impersonations of Amy Winehouse, Dr. Phil, Justin Timberlake, Hannah Montana, and Michael Jackson are appallingly inept. You may grin at the bawdy song lyrics, but there is nothing worth laughing-out-loud at in this potboiler. Disaster Movie pokes fun at Cloverfield, High School Musical, Superbad, Juno, Iron Man, Enchanted, The Dark Knight, The Love Guru, Night at the Museum, Twister, Wanted, Kung Fu Panda, No Country for Old Men, Beowulf, Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Speed Racer, and Sex and the City. Good spoof movies imitate what they mock, but Disaster Movie does a execrable job of merely imitating. Crista Flanagans letter perfect imitation of Ellen Page is the sole exception. Indeed, Disaster Movie contains more perspiration than inspiration. Sexy Carmen Electra, who has been in every Friedberg & Seltzer movie, plays the Angelina Jolie character from Wanted, but her role is more of a cameo. Incredibly, the filmmakers havent included any Brittany Spears scenes but Michael Jackson takes a beating twice. He is hiding in the trunk of Speed Racers jalopy between the monkey and Speeds young brother. Altogether, Disaster Movie is a disastrous line-up of lame skits thrown together without a clue.	1
So bad it sucks	Sweden	This movie was on TV once so I decided to watch it since I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay any money for it.The main character Will (played by Matt Lanter) has a dream where he meets a stone age Amy Winehouse (I think it&#x27;s supposed to be a joke) who tells him that the world is going to end the day this movie premiered in the cinema (Coincidence?) and to stop it they must find a crystal skull. Matt later wakes up to celebrate his super-sweet sixteenth birthday (despite him being in his twenties) in a scene where we get one unfunny joke and celebrity impersonation after another. Then disaster strikes (it seems kinda redundant though since this movie already is one), hurricanes, earthquakes, meteorites and other classic disaster movie ingredients hit planet earth one after another. Will, followed by his friends: Juney (Crista Flanagan), Calvin (Gary &#x22;G Thang&#x22; Johnson), and Lisa (Kim Kardashian) go out into the city and tries to find his girlfriend and a safe place and later realizes that he has to find the crystal skull to set things right.The problem with this movie is, just like other movies by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, that it doesn&#x27;t stay on the theme but goes all over the place and try to spoof almost every popular movie that was made that year, and some that even came later (Enchanted hadn&#x27;t come out that year, they could only have seen the trailer). And I use the term &#x22;spoof&#x22; lightly. Once again &#x22;Seltzerberger&#x22; show that they only grasp the most superficial concept of what humor is and never really bother to dig deeper and see what it is that makes things funny. Sometimes doing things outside the theme can work but not if it takes up a majority of the movie. And (for me) this movie is worse than Epic Movie. Yes you read right, Worse than Epic Movie. That movie at least had a story. Sure it was borrowed and &#x22;crapified&#x22; but at least it was a story. In this movie, everything that happens during the second act, when they try to find a safe place/figure out where they should go, just feels like a filler where the gang stumble into one reference after another. &#x22;Seltzerberger&#x27;s&#x22; over-reliance on potty humor, movie/TV references, random musical numbers, deliberately obvious stunt-doubles and crappy special effects does not save them this time.Seltzer and Friedberg, your movie sucks horribly. If I may paraphrase a line from &#x22;Billy Madison&#x22; I&#x27;d like to say: I award you only one star, and may God have mercy on your souls.Once again, if you want to see a GOOD movie made in the style that this train wreck was trying (and failing) to emulate, watch &#x22;Hotshots&#x22; &#x22;Airplane!&#x22;, &#x22;The naked gun&#x22; movies, &#x22;Top Secret&#x22; instead.	1
This aptly named movie is the worst film of 2008, the worst film of the 2000-2009 decade and possibly the worst film since the birth of motion pictures...	United States	Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer should be ashamed of themselves. Completely and utterly.I&#x27;m an extremely easy guy to please, especially when it comes to movies. I&#x27;m the one guy in the room who will admit to having enjoyed &#x22;Pluto Nash&#x22; and &#x22;The Mummy 3.&#x22; I&#x27;m the guy who will try to find something in every film to like. I enjoy movies, and am very rarely disappointed in them.Except for films like this, which are complete and utter idiotic failures by every stretch of the imagination. The team of Friedberg and Seltzer, whom are responsible for this abomination, should be ashamed. They have fundamentally failed understanding or displaying even the most basic ideas of filmmaking and comedy. They have failed with this film in a way which I have never before witnessed. This movie has literally made me angry in the few times I tried to sit through it, it was so insulting.How can they release such complete and utter trash like this? I actually cannot comprehend how they could have so little respect for the audience that this filth would be released.OK, fine, I&#x27;ll write an actual review. But this film ain&#x27;t pretty.This film has no plot. Literally no plot. It revolves around a group of people fleeing various disasters, while encountering a random array of pop-culture figures (including Batman, Amy Whinehouse, Michael Jackson, Beowulf, Princess Giselle from &#x22;Enchanted&#x22;, Iron Man, Hellboy, Flava Flav, Juno from &#x22;Juno&#x22;, etc.) who show up without any hint of irony or humor, introduce themselves to the camera, then awkwardly leave after a failed attempt or two at humor. Eventually they encounter a dwarf that is supposed to be Indiana Jones (played by Tony Cox) who tells them that in order to stop the disasters, they have to return a Crystal Skull to an altar. That&#x27;s it. That&#x27;s the plot.The acting is atrocious all around. The main actors are completely unlikable and their characters are made into incredible jerks. (We&#x27;re supposed to root for our hero to get back his girlfriend even though she&#x27;s some sort of serial cheater, and the main character is the single most bland, undeveloped person you could ever encounter.) The celebrity look alikes don&#x27;t resemble the celebrities they are &#x22;parodying&#x22; in the least and make no attempt to sound or act like them. (Nicole Parker is the only one to come vaguely close as the parody of Princess Giselle from &#x22;Enchanted&#x22;, but it still fails and is ruined by a random joke that destroys the character completely) You may notice I put &#x22;parodying&#x22; in quotes above. This is because, by definition, this film fails to serve as parody even though it&#x27;s meant to be. Parody is by definition meant to comment upon or mock established original works through humor and satire. This film doesn&#x27;t do that, the characters merely show up without making any sort of comment on the original works, and are too unfunny to mock them, hence, this fails at becoming parody, hence, it isn&#x27;t parody, and Seltzer/Friedberg failed at making what they set out to.The production is among the worst I&#x27;ve seen. The direction is stale and uninspired to the point of frustration for the viewer. The special effects are some of the worst I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;ve seen YouTube clips made by 12-year-olds with high production values than this. Costume and set design is painfully bad. The editing is abysmal and destroys a lot of the jokes, the animatronics are just crap. This is one of the worst productions I&#x27;ve ever seen.And the humor makes no sense. Every joke in this movie falls flat as a pancake. Jokes have no set-up, no humor, no irony and no payoff. It&#x27;s just random quips and nonsensical pop-culture references that date the film horribly.I really just an thrown a loop as to how Seltzer/Friendberg can live with themselves knowing they make films like this. This is by far their worst film, but all of their other films are nearly this bad as well. It&#x27;s honestly upsetting. They have no respect for audiences, no respect for their actors, and no creativity.This is without a doubt the worst film of 2008. It&#x27;s without a doubt the worst film of the 2000-20009 decade. And it is possibly the worst film since the birth of cinema. This makes films like &#x22;Manos: The Hands of Fate&#x22; and &#x22;Space Mutiny&#x22; look like high art. Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, you should be ashamed. 1 out of 10.	1
Disaster (of a) Movie	United States	Remember the good old days when Mel Brooks did &#x22;Young Frankenstein&#x22; or David Zucker did &#x22;Airplane?&#x22; This movie will have you wishing you were watching those movies. Seltzer and Friedling don&#x27;t do movies; they create really bad sketch scenes strung together without a plot, usually embarrassing their actors along the way. It&#x27;s not funny at all, nothing has a point and at no moment does anything come close to making sense. It&#x27;s like watching the thoughts of the stars of MADTv under marijuana overdose. There are no jokes, not a decent impression and one scene is dragged on one after another. It&#x27;s basically twenty to fifty characters running into each other in search of a plot. Nicole Parker acts as if she&#x27;s on acid, Crista Flanagan looks wasted and the rest of the cast look embarrassed they agreed to do this. It&#x27;s almost as if they&#x27;re looking at each other wondering &#x22;Was this in the script you read?&#x22; or &#x22;When do we start the movie?&#x22; or &#x22;I hope this isn&#x27;t used in the final draft.&#x22; Bottom line: Seltzer and Friedling need to be stopped from doing these movies. I could do it better. Anyone could do it better.	1
Rusty Nails....	United States	Yes, the title of this review is relevant. Because said instruments for bonding wood which have largely changed into iron oxide are what I wanted to shove into my eyeballs after watching this... No. I refuse to call this a movie. It&#x27;s rather closer to something you might find behind my dishwasher.So let&#x27;s dive behind said appliance for the cleaning of dinnerware and have a look at just what makes it so disgusting, shall we? Starting with the (Highly Appropriate, but not in the way they intended) title. Disaster Movie, huh? Because I see no semblance of any form of film based upon natural events which cause devastation and- oh, let&#x27;s cut the big words, there&#x27;s pretty much nothing linking this to any form of disaster flick in existence.The humor.... Seltzer and Friedburg. No more need be said on this issue.... you know, actually, that pretty much covers the entire thing right there. But, I suppose you want more in-depth... Suffice to say, humor is the wrong word; I&#x27;d call it &#x22;something that a failing-grades immature twelve-year-old who thinks toilet jokes are the pinnacle of all humor might laugh at&#x22; and even that might be a stretch. The jokes aren&#x27;t funny at all, the random scenes don&#x27;t fit in whatsoever, and they&#x27;re not even parodying their targets, just making references and effectively saying &#x22;See how stupid these movies are? Er, I farted, dur hur hur.&#x22; In short, I need to go find some rusty nails. While I don&#x27;t advocate piracy, if you must see it, go find it on the internet somewhere; it&#x27;s not even worth the two dollars to rent it from Redbox.	1
Imitation Is Not Parody	United States	Someone needs to tell the producers, the authors, the director, and everyone else involved in this film that mere imitation is not parody. To make a film satirizing whatever pop-culture is current, it isn&#x27;t enough just to string together a bunch of skits imitating those pop-culture icons. Each parody must not only imitate, but caricature the icon, whether it be a person, a particular movie, a hot toy, or whatever. It must be able to point out the absurdity of popularism while still being, in and of itself, funny as well. I can go around with a giant clock on a chain around my neck and use Blackjack gum to make myself look as if I have bad teeth, but if I don&#x27;t also have something both original AND funny to say about Flava Flav, then I am merely an imitator, not a satirist.These filmmakers may have hit it big with prior efforts, but this one was clearly phoned in. What is sad is that the bulk of the movie is so sadly, embarrassingly bad, that when the one or two genuinely funny moments occur (one character &#x22;bends&#x22; a bullet a little too much and it hooks around 360 degrees, hitting the person he was trying to avoid anyway) the audience is so stunned they forget to laugh, as if asking themselves if they really did see something genuinely funny or was so much of their intelligence already sucked away by this toilet of a movie that they are imagining humor where it doesn&#x27;t really exist? It is wicked hard to get a genuinely original and entertaining film made in Hollywood these days, bad form by these filmmakers to take money that could well have gone into a much better project and squandering it on this four reels of rubbish!	1
Well Ill give them this: The title was dead on.	None	What I mean by that, is that this move WAS a disaster. So to call it Disaster Movie is completely suitable. But that&#x27;s the only good thing I have to say about it. Now, I adore some of the actors in this movie. And I died a little bit inside because they can do SO much better. Now, my question is how did this movie ever end up in theatres? The best I would expect of it would be some MTV or MuchMusic movie that they played over the summer, but no.I just hope that those two get expelled from the business. Personally, I really want to hear them justify their movies. I just don&#x27;t get it. From the beginning there&#x27;s a full minute scene in which a bad Amy Winehouse look-a-like just burps. How is that funny? It&#x27;s not! Friedberg and Selzer, or whatever your names are: GROW UP! GROW A PAIR! And start making some really movies that are for people who aren&#x27;t 12-yr-old boys sneaking a late-night movie behind mummy and daddy&#x27;s back.	1
TVBRobotnik at the Movies: Disaster Movie	United States	Parody movies. Ah, yes. They were an opus for National Lampoon, Monty Python, Mel Brooks, the Wayans brothers, and Zucker, Abrahams, &#x26; Zucker.But, what happened? What happened is Friedberg and Seltzer. When they wrote Spy Hard and Scary Movie, they were great. Nothing idiotic, or pop-culture referenced.However, there is a major problem. They make parody films as spinoffs of Scary Movie. The first three were Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, and they were only cash cows to fit the benefit of parody films. Unfortunately, they suck! This is when Julia Jones got in rehab, Lucy, Edward, Susan, and Peter get their part-time job at McDonald&#x27;s, and the homosexual Spartans were selling cocaine for the price of one.But, I digress. They were terrible, but their next project... was MUCH, MUCH, MUCH, MUCH worse! Hence is the name, Disaster Movie was born. Born to kill comedies.Seriously, why would it be successful? At least the name is correct. I mean, these films were critically panned, so why make this movie? Basically, it makes Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen look like Gone with the Wind, Epic Movie look like 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the ever-so-decent Space Chimps look like Star Wars.Well, this movie barely parodies Disaster movies, it parodies pop-culture references, pre-tween Family Guy-like jokes, and movies in other genres that don&#x27;t have to do with Disaster-related films. I mean, in my school, the classmates are entertained on this film. Not me! The movie opens with a shot spoofing the one in Armageddon. In the year 10,001 B.C., a caveman runs away from a mammoth before getting in a fight with Wolf. He then encounters a saber-toothed, gasoline-drinking Amy Winehouse, who informs him that the world will end on August 29, 2008, revealing their fate laying in a crystal skull. The film flash-forwards to the present, where Will has a &#x22;Sweet Sixteen&#x22; party at his house, despite the fact that he&#x27;s 25. Will has a dream where he is a Jumper and accidentally impales.On their way to the museum to save Amy, who called to tell Will she&#x27;s trapped under a statue, they run into Batman, who informs them that they must go to the evacuation buses by 9 p.m., and also mentions that there will be no chance of survival if they go to save Amy. Learning that it&#x27;s closer to nine than he thought, Batman throws a rope, which accidentally lands on a car that drags him away. With time against them, the Princess kills Speed Racer so they can hijack his car in the trunk and drive to the museum. When they get there, they save Amy who reveals the Crystal Skull from Will&#x27;s dream to be the only thing that can stop the end of the world. As Will and Amy make their way to the altar, Calvin and the Princess find that the museum doors are closed and all the artifacts have come alive, including Kung Fu Panda, who fights Calvin. When Calvin makes out with the Princess after beating him, he sees that she is actually a transvestite by removing &#x22;his&#x22; wig while the Panda takes out a katana and kills them.Meanwhile, Will and Amy run into Beowulf, who fights Will in the nude. After Beowulf is defeated, Will and Amy meet Will&#x27;s father (Tony Cox) and Will returns the Crystal Skull to its altar, averting further destruction. The film ends with a wedding ceremony for Will and Amy being performed by The Guru Shitka, who tries to get Amy to &#x22;tickle his pickle&#x22;. Then all the characters come sing a song about &#x22;dating&#x22; each other which sets of a chain (&#x22;Disaster Movie Sex Song&#x22;), ending with the chipmunks being crushed by yet another cow.Generic plot-line for a parody film, hell, the jokes aren&#x27;t even funny! I can&#x27;t believe they would make this! Good news is, on Labor Day weekend, it bombed, making it 8th place at the box-office. Thank you, Tropic Thunder! You saved the day.I don&#x27;t wanna know of what they&#x27;re making next. Wait, Queen Kong??? Nooooooooooo! I don&#x27;t wanna watch Disaster Movie again. I wanna watch WALL-E again. But, it may not be as bad as... *shudder* Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen or *EVEN MORE SHUDDER (with a facepalm)* Air Buddies franchise.FINAL VERDICT: 0/10!!!!!!!!	1
Complete & Utter Rubbish	United Kingdom	I dont usually review anything, but this film is so bad that i felt i had to tell everyone i could and this seemed the best way to do it.I have never been a fan of the Movie films that have been coming out non-stop for the last 9 years, as i dont think any of them are even remotely funny, the films have no story, make no sense and the gags are almost all the same.This reaches a new level mediocrity however. The title bears no resemblance to disaster style films at all, other than one poke at twister. The whole film consists of bad impressions of superheroes, celebrities and other movies like juno, indiana jones and the incredible hulk.In summary, they really need to stop making these movies. They are outdated and unoriginal now.If Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer are reading PLEASE STOP WASTING YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY.Its just not funny anymore and hasnt been in a long, long time!!	1
What a perfect name for a terrible movie...	Sweden	Just the name of the movie itself is bad enough, but if you&#x27;re really curious about finding out what&#x27;s behind that white, disastrous poster, just one warning: You won&#x27;t be happy again for a long time afterwards.Just as &#x22;Scary Movie&#x22;, &#x22;Meet the Spartans&#x22; and &#x22;Epic Movie&#x22;, it is build up of cheap, ridiculous and really bad jokes. But this time they apparently didn&#x27;t care at all or even tried to make it entertaining.They make fun of celebrities in ways that has to be seen to be believed, one actor has around 10 different roles and he acts in them in the worst kind way, the supposed-to-be-funny moments are just plain stupid instead, the &#x22;special&#x22; effects aren&#x27;t special at all and the main characters are so annoying that you might start to weep just because of the bad and annoying acting! There&#x27;s nothing funny or memorable about this film, it&#x27;s just a cruel joke that shouldn&#x27;t have been made or even thought about in the first place.They probably named this film &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22; because they knew it was bad but needed millions of cash extremely fast.Stay away from this truly awful movie at all costs!	1
And the title says it all!	Leeds, UK, Europe, Planet Earth, Space	Seriously. When are people going to stop making this garbage? It&#x27;s just so stupid. First we have the trashy Scary Movie series then people got inspired and made films like &#x27;Date Movie&#x27; and &#x27;Epic Movie&#x27;. And then this piece of junk blew in. I mean come on! This whole conspiracy is just going too far. Do the makers even know how agonising these movie are?! Have some dignity people! Unlike the same old hideous gags, the film makers got one thing right about this movie. It had the perfect title! Disaster Movie. Yes, it is a disaster. It&#x27;s a disaster in so many various ways. In fact such a disaster that within the first 5 minutes of this film...I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. It was just torture. I then switched to a different channel, relieving myself from the sheer disturbance I let my eyes and ears go through.Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a short definition of this trash - look no further than it&#x27;s 2-worded title! It just simply says it all! And sorry for my rating, I couldn&#x27;t rate it below 1 star. I would rather have gone for -10000!	1
stupid!	United States	This movie was 100% stupid, I am very simply amused I thought Epic Movie was great date movie is OK, but this is so stupid. When I first walked into the movie theater I wondered why I was the only one there but after 5 minutes it made perfect sense. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, avoid it at all costs! There was not even one funny scene in the whole 1 and a half hours. I think the movie might have been directed by blind, deaf and retarded monkeys! The first scene had potential, it started by saying 10,001 B.C. and that can be so funny. I wonder if the editors meant to say 9,999 BC of if they really meant 10,001? Do not ever watch this movie!	1
No Redeemign Qualities	United States	Honestly if youre thinking about watching this go watch Anus Magillicutty instead. At least that film had some redeeming qualities. This film is to cinema what Hitler was to the Jews. In future decades when people look back and saw that this movie came out and people actually went to see it theyll regard us the same way we regard cultures that believed stars were burning vents on giant chariot wheels pilot by the Gods. This film had no jokes. Picture going to see a stand-up comedian whos act was saying remember smurfs, remember snorks, remember superman thats basically what you get here, except this has even more irreverent pop culture references than a Shrek movie. Ignore this garbage.	1
You know its no good	United Kingdom	When will they stop? Not content with Scary Movies 1-500,000, Not Another Teen Movie, Date Movie, Epic Movie, Superhero Movie and Meet The Spartans, Hollywood has churned out Disaster Movie - another comedic spoof of the years biggest blockbusters - which for the most part were decent films; and in some cases Oscar winners: No Country for Old Men and Juno for example.So why spoof popular films? They were popular for a reason; and were, for he most part 1000 times better than this lazy, half-finished old horse tripe.The fundamental flaw of Disaster Movie is that its just not funny. Having Princess Gizelle from Enchanted eating glass for example is not only disgusting but also cynical and in the worst possible taste, and then theres the films attempts to be topical, by having Amy Winehouse spring up from out of a bush drinking Whisky and talking of having gasoline which was good - surely the potentially fatal drink and drug problems of such a famous person is not something to flippantly joke about, and more to the point - unashamedly cash in on; as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer have.There is no plot to this film - people run around on the 29th August - as I said, not a plot, and because of this Disaster, ahem Movie (can it really be called a movie?) feels like one and a half hours of ear-bleedingly, eye-wateringly unfunny outtakes, which by the end makes one wish that like Iron Man, The Hulk and Hellboy, a cow would fall from the sky, and crush one to death.Give the &pound;5.20 ticket price for this film to charity instead.0/10 (If only IMDb let you score that)	1
its so bad its bad	United Kingdom	disaster movie is just a bunch of poor skits of movie trailers & of the moment B to Z-list celebrities, thrown together in an incoherent way. when they do try an actual JOKE they are built up and delivered with the poorest of wit and timing, with hardly any connection to each other or the story, even classed as inane comedy the jokes and delivery still fail. and the rest of the comedy is as much effort as showing a character from another film, telegraphing who it is by shouting their name and doing a bad impression of them, thats as much effort there is to it. i think in a celebrity obsessed society kids are titillated by the mere sight of a celebrity or character from another film being on screen, and thats all the joke is, another character being on screen. character from another film/celebrity+being told this is a comedy=funny? The movie is only 1 hour and 15 minutes long, which is kind of strange for a modern movie, its very short, why do you think it was so short? because they couldnt think of anymore jokes to fill in time. Seltzberg had ran out of jokes and couldnt even pad time out with actual plot or character development(the main characters are introduced by just appearing on screen in a fully formed stereotype) which would have made the movie a little(not much) better. no they just padded it out by dragging the joke out till they couldnt keep it up any longer and dragging the musical interludes out to the fullest, there is no actual tangible plot to base the skits around, the plot is just a backdrop, to show the different skits and celebs with different background scenery so the audience dont get bored. the acting is terrible, the script is terrible, the characters had no depth or real like-ability unless you are fond of stereotyped clich&eacute;d characters and arnt developed in any way, the directing is terrible. thats why its still stuck at the bottom in the IMDb list, because its probably the worst modern movie ever made.	1
The title speaks for the whole movie - its disastrous	Philippines	Just read the title. That pretty much sums up my review for this tripe. Dont come near me if you actually LIKED the film, I might snatch your eyes out and forbid you from watching movies ever again.Disaster Movie gives us a birds eye view of whats happening to Hollywood these days - harebrained sluts and ho-bags are taking over the movie industry, producing these cheap, recycled, swallowed-and-then-vomited movies which insults the intelligence of 45% of the human race.What Im trying to say here is, if you actually find the movie well-written and downright hilarious, there must be something wrong with you. Disaster Movie doesnt have a plot, no comprehensible characters, no tangible conclusion... its as shapeless as gas. It doesnt have a destination, it loiters on triviality, and the so-called Disaster goes nowhere.Comedy Value Theres only ONE scene which actually made me crack a smile. The Carrie Bradshaw and Juno MacGuff encounter. What bothers me the most is the screenplay writers/directors Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg violently raping Diablo Codys award-winning screenplay, copying every catchphrase that it has, like committing an act of plagiarism, thereby giving another reason as to why should the two of them be expelled from Hollywood.The movie is chock-full of clich&eacute;s. Whod laugh at Iron Man, Hellboy and the Incredible Hulk getting crushed by a falling cow? Whod laugh at Hancock hitting his head on a lightpost? Whod laugh at that stupid Women of Wrestling (WoW) skit near the beginning? (Well for those who actually found these scenes funny and risible, you better check if your brain is still functioning.)Story Disaster Movie doesnt have a story. Seems like all the two blockheads have done is to collect as much movie characters as they can and alter their image by transforming them into obscene, cussing retards. Then, they line them up, and one by one, they get a share of their screen time. Theres your story.DISASTER MOVIE IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MOST STUPID MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Do not watch this film, for the sake of humanity. This film will ruin your day by feeding you huge doses of sheer stupidity. Its like every time you laugh while watching this film, your IQ is reduced by 2. Every applause that youd give to this film persuades more stupid parodies to come and make men lose their sense of humor. If you actually enjoyed this, youre as air-headed as the two screenwriters.PLEASE, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM AT ALL. YOU WILL TOTALLY REGRET IT. Ive watched it from start to finish, and my intellect just lost its virginity.	1
A disaster of a movie doesnt even describe it	United Kingdom	Will (Lanter) has always struggled with relationships and wants to prove to Amy that he has it in him to make it, only the world is coming to an end on the same day.Any review, any trailer or anything relative cant show how bad Disaster Movie is unless you actually go to the cinema to watch it.The plot is conventional and boring, the spoofs of current cinema releases are inaccurate and too crude and every other joke drags and drags until you cant look at the screen any more.The naked gun trilogy provided plenty of giggles but these modern day spoofs including Date movie and Epic movie just basically ruin the originals, with exceptionally poor jokes and stunts, and this film is just pathetic in every sense. Is there a point to these films other than short term profit? Will these be made into long term classics? Who will remember certain films or celebrities in 10 years time when watching this? The movie opens in 10,001 BC, really poor choice, and prehistoric Amy Winehouse sets the tone of what the film will be like, cheap digs at celebrities and other films.Hellboy, Batman, Ironman, The Hulk, Enchanted, Hancock, Juno, Beowulf, Indiana Jones and Sex and the City among others are the main films to be spoofed, while Winehouse, Miley Cyrus and Jessica Simpson are also slated, not to mention a really stupid skit on Justin Timberlake.Stupid, inaccurate, boring, predictable, the only positive thing to say is this film seems to know that its goal is to entertain, which it does so by being so unfunny that you have to occasionally laugh at how poor it truly is.I personally felt robbed of &pound;7 after I left, not to mention embarrassed at actually sitting through the whole film. We pay honest money to go out and have a good time, and even if a film is not to our taste, then there will be some consolation to our night, but Disaster Movie made me want to stop watching films all together.This niche will continue to grow which is very sad in the industry. Parodies can be funny, but not if they are crude, predictable and down right shocking.Disaster Movie is an awful thing, and not worth the time or energy.	1
Awful ... and awkward!	United States	There arent enough negative words in the dictionary to adequately describe how awful this movie was. No plot. No continuity. The writers seem to think profanity is a valid substitute for witty dialogue. The only disaster was that this movie was released on an unsuspecting public. But wait! Theres more. We had the ultimate awkward experience! Not only were we subjected to one of the worlds worst movies, but the star and a large group of his family & friends happened to be seated in front of us and next to us. We wanted to walk out on the movie, but how do you tell the stars aunt, Oh, sorry. Your nephew is really cute, but nothing he does can save this total piece of crap. Were out of here! At least my husband learned a valuable lesson from this experience - if the movie title contains the word movie... dont waste your money! Run, dont walk, away from this movie as fast as you can!	1
Disaster of a movie	Germany	Well, normally my time is too valuable to comment on such crap, but this movie sucks so much, that i see it as my duty to warn you against this movie. Where shall I begin? I think its the best to start with the trailer: I hate trailers of comedies because you usually see the best jokes before watching the movie. But this time, even the trailer wasnt funny. Then i saw the movie and the only time I was laughing was when i actually saw someone who laughed about the movie... I cant even recommend this movie if you are a trash-fan. Because there is no movie to compare it with, I chose something else. If you enjoy staring into space, then you MIGHT find this movie funny. While writing this comment, this movie is at the top of the Bottom 100. And this is the only place to be for this movie.	1
Awful! Awful! Awful!	United Kingdom	This left me speechless......and not in a breath-taking &#x22;Shawshank Redemption&#x22; type way! I literally wanted to rip my arm off and throw it at the TV it was so bad. My husband and I made a bet with one another as to who could keep watching it the longest........the loser buying the weekend beers! I was quite happy to lose that night. I had no idea what was going on, it kept skipping from one sketch to another with no plot, no reason and NO POINT! Awful acting, awful impressions, awful film! Pretty much is what it says on the tin, A Disaster. Do not watch this movie. You&#x27;d be better off stapling your genitals to a table for an hour...it&#x27;ll be less painful for you!	1
How to make a parody without jokes	Belgium	Whenever someone doesn&#x27;t like a movie, a common go-to criticism to hurl at it is that it has no plot. In reality, this is usually a load of crap. A movie can have a plot you don&#x27;t like, or it can have a plot that&#x27;s a bit contrived, but pretty much every movie has a plot. This brings us to &#x22;Disaster Movie&#x22;. This movie has no plot! I mean, there sorta kinda are four main characters, but they&#x27;re basically just mannequins who stand there while unfunny things happen around them. The order of the scenes honestly doesn&#x27;t matter at all, this is almost like a sketch movie but without the punchlines. I&#x27;m not a big fan of writing classes (read my reviews for further proof), but what ever happened to the classic story structure where protagonists have to reach some kind of goal while fighting some kind of adversity? Have I just gotten too old-fashioned for the movies, is this the kind of experimental filmmaking that will become a standard for further generations? Well, as of this writing this movie&#x27;s got a whopping 1.9 rating, so I think I&#x27;m safe. Got to admit though, I did laugh once during the otherwise terrible &#x22;Sex and The City&#x22;-spoof. Sue me, I probably deserve it.	1
Worst ever	United States	I have had root canal surgeries that were more fun. This mess makes &#x22;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#x22; (long considered the worst movie ever made) look like an Academy Award contender. The basic idea is good, make fun of all the disaster movies, but the actual movie is horrible. I get the feeling that the makers got high on something and just threw whatever came to mind into the script, figuring the audience would be too dumb to understand. These people should be banned from ever making another film and kept away from all movie cameras. I managed to sit through a total of 15 minutes and felt like I should wash my eyes and brain out with bleach to get rid of the memory. Terrible doesn&#x27;t begin to describe it.	1
Ronseal. Does exactly what is says on the tin. Disatser Movie. Does exactly what is says in the title!	United Kingdom	This is without doubt a contender for the worst movie in cinematic history - past, present and future!The humour is painfully unfunny and can be interpreted as offensive on occasions. There is nothing wrong with offensive humour (well there is), if it&#x27;s rather humorous, just ask Sacha Baron Cohen - however this is unquestionably offensive to any human with an average intellect.Jason Friedberg I actually admire for evolving the &#x27;horror spoof&#x27; with his fine comedy &#x27;Scary Movie&#x27;, which occasionally had me in stitches. This however, borders on the lines of disgracefulness.Matt Lanter prancing around for the entire duration with woeful lines and abysmal acting may appeal to the less intellectual women who need to keep there eyes occupied for approximately an hour and a half. However, everyone else will be left feeling mugged, either for the fact they have wasted their precious lives on this drivel, or - even worse - they have spent good money on this drivel.I think my verdict is loud and clear!	1
I laughed at how ironic the title is more than anything else.	United Kingdom	I might have only sat through only half of the film, but from that I came to the decision that I didn&#x27;t want to watch anymore. It&#x27;s not funny in the slightest. In fact, I laughed at how ironic the title is more than anything else. Whoever gave this the green-light should be sacked immediately. I do have a couple of the films in which this tries to parody and fails miserable, like Iron Man and the Incredible Hulk, and all I can say is that it completely destroys them - it actually made me angry. This is truly a Disaster Movie. This film made me cringe with all the incredible badness of it all. I will never watch this film all the way through. However when I do, I want an award.	1
Excruciatingly unfunny	Ohio	There have been several different movies that I&#x27;ve seen in my life that were so painfully awful I was sure there would be no other to be worse, I have sat through movies like Alone in the Dark, Battlefield earth, North, and this piece of shi* trying to pass itself off as a comedy is unquestionably the absolute worst thing I&#x27;ve ever seen.Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are the most talentless hacks ever to pick up a video camera or use a keyboard. My head felt like it was going to explode after I finished watching because it enraged me so much.Here is a small list of things this movie tries to parody, and somebody needs to explain to me what any of them have to do with the disaster genre.Juno, American Gladiators, Mylie Cyrus, Flavor Flav, Amy Winehouse, Jessica Simpson, and lots others that I feel should have sued the hell out of these assholes for including them in this vomitorium of a film.This plot makes absolutely NO SENSE AT ALL! It consists entirely of jokes so awful that it&#x27;ll make you sick having to hear them. At one point they accuse Juno of having bad writing, the hypocrisy and Irony was big enough to see from space.I don&#x27;t want to continue thinking too much about the horrible experience I had viewing this wretch, so I will end by saying this is no doubt the worst movie ever made in history and If you laugh at ANYTHING in this heap you are an idiot and a waste of life, plain and simple.	1
Id rather be tortured than watch this again!	United Kingdom	Undoubtedly the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching in my life!This film, and I use the term loosely, was so awful that it is one of only a handful I have ever switched off in order to be bored instead- as being bored is preferable to having your eyes gouged out by this dreadful piece of garbage. The story is non existent, even to the extent of parody, and the parody itself is done abysmaly with virtually no reference to the source material at all. In fact, this film is almost entirely made up of &#x27;parody&#x27; versions of clips from other films that were only taken from the trailers from said movies- the vast majority of which aren&#x27;t disaster movies in the first place. How this is supposed to pass for a comedy film when it has no plot, virtually no parody and fewer jokes than the most dirgeful funeral I have attended is beyond me. Perhaps that is the joke? If so, it&#x27;s not funny.Whilst the rest of the genre made by (some of) the same production team such as Date Movie and Superhero Movie at least made parodical reference and jokes based upon films from the genre the relevant film was named after, Disaster Movie instead is just a description of what the end product turned out to be. We can but hope that this film puts nails in the coffin of the directors careers so they can go and be more productive in the film industry sweeping floors or emptying bins- footage of which would be more entertaining than this drivel.Mark my words- no matter how bored you are, how cheap this becomes on disk or how free it may be on the internet- do not waste your time watching it. You will only regret the loss of those precious minutes of your life, which could have been spent more satisfyingly and less painfully by watching paint dry whilst being beaten about the head with a mallet.Forced watching of this film should be added to the bans under the Geneva Convention as torture. I for one would rather be water-boarded than see this film again. You have been warned!	1
Awful	None	I must say first of all, that I did not expect this to be a very good movie, or even all that funny, just a few laughs. What I got, was a complete lack of humor. Not a single joke made me laugh say but two where I mildly smiled. First of all, this barely had anything to do with as disaster happening, except for a few earthquakes now and then. Most of the movie consists of 1. throwing in as many references from other movies as possible, in context to absolutely nothing and 2. abysmal rap numbers every 5-10 minutes, that just made me want to bash my head in with a hammer. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this piece of crap.	1
