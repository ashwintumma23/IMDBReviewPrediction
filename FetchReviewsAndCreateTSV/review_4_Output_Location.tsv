Film surpasses the hype	United States	We&#39;ve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We&#39;ve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.<br><br>Everything that&#39;s been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.<br><br>For as much action as there is in this movie, it&#39;s the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.<br><br>Bale&#39;s Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox&#39;s inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. <br><br>As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It&#39;s not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker&#39;s stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could&#39;ve pulled something like this off. That&#39;s how difficult of a role this was, and that&#39;s why Ledger&#39;s performance is so great.<br><br>This isn&#39;t an action movie. It&#39;s a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it&#39;s all in there. 
Surpasses "Begins" in every aspect!!!	United States	Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy "The Dark Knight" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the "damsel-in-distress" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than "Begins" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than "Begins." The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008. 
Best movie of 2008 hands down!	Netherlands	I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn&#39;t just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.<br><br>Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.<br><br>Nolan has made his &quot;I will always be remembered&quot; movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. <br><br>Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don&#39;t, then something beez wrongz with youz! 
Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait	Melbourne, Australia	I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.<br><br>It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the &#39;Old Days&#39; of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we&#39;re given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.<br><br>All the hailing of Ledger&#39;s performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you&#39;d remember from any other film. It&#39;s impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you&#39;re laughing.<br><br>If Ledger wasn&#39;t enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham&#39;s &#39;fallen White Knight&#39; and Batman&#39;s direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones&#39; portrayal look like children&#39;s breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman&#39;s &#39;conscience&#39; and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.<br><br>There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the &#39;majestic but unfinished&#39; tones of Begins - but it suits the film&#39;s tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.<br><br>I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn&#39;t quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn&#39;t what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn&#39;t) was solid and suited the film well.<br><br>All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn&#39;t already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous &#39;Superhero&#39; adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn&#39;t campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could&#39;ve been given.<br><br>If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won&#39;t regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I&#39;ll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don&#39;t like it, then that&#39;s also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won&#39;t take it to heart.<br><br>Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can&#39;t wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray! 
The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted	SLC, UT	I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for &quot;Dark Knight&quot;.<br><br>Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, &quot;Dark Knight&quot; ably stands on its own with or without &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. At a two and a half hour runtime, it&#39;s definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.<br><br>Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.<br><br>Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson&#39;s portrayal is true unpredictability. It&#39;s obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn&#39;t easy. How exactly does one take him down when he&#39;s woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?<br><br>Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the &quot;Batman&quot; animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.<br><br>Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can&#39;t represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we&#39;ve seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight&#39;s upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City&#39;s dark underside.<br><br>&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; gets a solid 10 of 10 stars. 
Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.	the big city	I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...?  It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary. 
Batman at his best and beyond	United Kingdom	Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman&#39;s struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to &quot;confront everything he believes&quot; and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman&#39;s campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.<br><br>There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can&#39;t see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark &amp; sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don&#39;t turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol &amp; Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn&#39;t made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit &amp; vegetables on the screen. 
The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie	Memphis, Tennessee	(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker&#39;s plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.<br><br>(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger&#39;s performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don&#39;t ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger&#39;s performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don&#39;t think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10) 
The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made	Australia	I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan&#39;s follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins,&quot; The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.<br><br>I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with &quot;Batman Begins.&quot; Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale&#39;s tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale&#39;s flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.<br><br>Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger&#39;s Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman&#39;s worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...<br><br>All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (&quot;Thankyou for Smoking&quot;) as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent&#39;s love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal&#39;s performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman&#39;s Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.<br><br>Wally Pfister&#39;s cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.<br><br>Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.<br><br>It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (&quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan&#39;s flawless direction.<br><br>5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!! 
The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie	Chicago, Illinois	I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I&#39;m writing this movie comment this late is because I didn&#39;t wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can&#39;t stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it&#39;s hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman&#39;s skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson&#39;s performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like &quot;What are they, kidding?&quot;, once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I&#39;m not going to compare Jack and Heath&#39;s performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath&#39;s Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn&#39;t know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he&#39;s crazy, he&#39;s driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. <br><br>This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who&#39;s previous film, Batman Begins, didn&#39;t really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it&#39;s not real, people don&#39;t dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don&#39;t name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.<br><br>Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he&#39;s inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he&#39;s going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham&#39;s mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the &quot;Classy Villain that Gotham needs&quot;, he also has brought a new thought into Batman&#39;s head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham&#39;s &quot;White Knight&quot; trying to put all of Gotham&#39;s scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.<br><br>All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone&#39;s going crazy over Heath Ledger&#39;s performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath&#39;s and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don&#39;t wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can&#39;t come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I&#39;ve seen it twice in one weekend, I&#39;m going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don&#39;t mind one bit. I can&#39;t wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.<br><br>10/10 
The Dark Knight ---- Best Batman Movie Ever.	Australia	I have just come out of the &quot;Dark Curtain&quot; Screening for The Dark Knight in Adelaide, and I&#39;m blown away.<br><br>Nolan&#39;s directing is sublime, the pacing of the movie was so well kept, managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying &quot;Now how in the hell did they do that?!&quot;, Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I don&#39;t want to say much about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding it&#39;s release, but it&#39;s there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.<br><br>9/10. 
Heath Ledger&#39;s Dark and Brilliant Swan Song	London, England	I couldn&#39;t believe &quot;The Dark knight&quot; could live up to the hype. That&#39;s perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something we&#39;ll never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bale&#39;s Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want. 
A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions	New Zealand	Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I don&#39;t usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is certainly loud and violent but it&#39;s not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What he&#39;s done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo! 
I&#39;m sorry everyone, this is no masterpiece.	United States	** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** <br><br>Christopher Nolan&#39;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, it&#39;s quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.<br><br>It is a given that Heath Ledger&#39;s portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the film&#39;s opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworld&#39;s combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.<br><br>So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldn&#39;t have been. Uneven scripting there.<br><br>But that&#39;s nitpicking in comparison to the film&#39;s greater faults. The ultimate reason why &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.<br><br>OK, here is where people start saying: &quot;But it&#39;s a movie! It doesn&#39;t have to be possible.&quot; I know, thanks. I agree, it doesn&#39;t have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they don&#39;t want this to be considered as a mere &quot;superhero movie,&quot; or &quot;action movie.&quot; Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.<br><br>(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys he&#39;s finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesn&#39;t work because The Joker&#39;s plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they aren&#39;t smart enough to be effective as help. It&#39;s a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.<br><br>(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but c&#39;mon, he doesn&#39;t exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesn&#39;t have supernatural powers, so he shouldn&#39;t have a supernatural aura.<br><br>(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didn&#39;t notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.<br><br>I&#39;d actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledger&#39;s performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. <br><br>Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but he&#39;s almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. He&#39;s also a little bit stiff when he&#39;s in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in &quot;The Prestige&quot; was more emotional, effective, and polished.<br><br>Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in &quot;Thank You For Smoking.&quot; Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.<br><br>Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but that&#39;s not saying much. <br><br>I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but I&#39;ll spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; succeeded in escaping the &quot;superhero movie&quot; label. But it&#39;s not a masterpiece.<br><br>Plain and simply, it has too many holes. 
Let&#39;s be realistic.	Syracuse, NY, USA	I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just don&#39;t think they played them loudly. I don&#39;t like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didn&#39;t believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because it&#39;s blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. <br><br>The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholson&#39;s output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burton&#39;s original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon.<br><br>I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, let&#39;s say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250? 
Batman just got really modern	United States	This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.<br><br>The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didn&#39;t feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks it&#39;s brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second he&#39;s here and the next he&#39;s on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.<br><br>After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very clich&eacute; way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever?<br><br>and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track people&#39;s cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.<br><br>so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasn&#39;t as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set. 
Best film ever? You must be batty!	United Kingdom	Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together.<br><br>Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. I&#39;d have thought that a man of dent&#39;s resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker.<br><br>I really don&#39;t think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledger&#39;s performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation.<br><br>The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didn&#39;t try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.<br><br>Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype. 
Surprisingly incoherent and boring	United States	I don&#39;t think that in my quarter century of living I&#39;ve ever felt more disconnected from the pop-culture at large than after seeing this movie. With all the hype and uniform praise I thought beforehand that this is at least a solid piece of cinematic craft, maybe embellished slightly by Heath Ledger&#39;s unexpected death.<br><br>Unfortunately, this movie is rock solid proof that sometimes mass delusion can strike an entire society at one time. There is absolutely no way that this film can be regarded not just as a masterpiece, but even as half-way decent.<br><br>Let&#39;s get to the point. First - the plot. It&#39;s just unconvincing as a whole. Batman is basically a side character with little to do as he takes backseat on the Joker train. He whines incessantly about how no one needs him and how he needs to hang up his cape. Do it already! His troubled relationship with Rachel Dawes has zero chemistry and it&#39;s hard to care about the outcome. The idea of Joker being an anarchist, goalless and malevolent force sounds good on paper, but it translates to aimlessness on the screen. Joker shows up out of nowhere seemingly with no one backing him and then... snap! It seems like the whole world is at his service. Not only he has no trouble hijacking a school bus (and then blending into a line of school buses after driving out of a half collapsed bank), hacking into the public TV feed or rigging an entire hospital with explosives; he apparently does it with such ease that the creators didn&#39;t feel the need to reveal a shred of information about how he did it. Many events in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example - what was the purpose of Lt. Gordon faking his death? And why did they make a point of showing the scene where his family is informed of the death - was that just to get the audience to buy into it as well? That&#39;s just dumb and a waste of time. Why did Harvey Dent become evil all of a sudden? Sure he was badly burned, but he had to know the risks going into this business and he had a steely resolve just minutes prior. There are many other plot issues, but it&#39;s pointless listing them all. They are there and easy to spot.<br><br>The acting in the movie is a-OK, but most of the actors just don&#39;t have any good lines as their characters are irrelevant puppets. Heath Ledger is good for sure, but his take on the character gets tedious after a while - mostly from overexposure. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress, but she&#39;s just so wrong for the role. She&#39;s a nice-girl-next-door type and as superficial as it sounds, it&#39;s hard to believe that she would have two hotshots like Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne chasing after her. Christian Bale has zero material to work with and they&#39;ve turned Morgan Freeman into a moralizing nerd. Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Michael Caine do a decent job considering the script they were given to work with.<br><br>The screenplay is atrocious, incongruent and messy. It&#39;s like the movie was cut-up into a thousand pieces of varying length, reshuffled and then strung together. There is no natural progression of events and subsequent scenes frequently befuddle. It takes a couple of minutes to figure out what the hell is going on or why should we care. It&#39;s just poorly done.<br><br>For all the car chases, fight scenes, and giant explosions, the movie is just unforgivably boring. It&#39;s a combination stemming from a poor script, naive (or barely existent) plot, flat characters (that can&#39;t be remotely identified with much less loved or hated), and a general lack of good sense. There is also an annoying feeling that the creators had a rather low opinion of the viewers intelligence or maybe they just rushed the movie and had to come up with a lot of material in a little time, hence the low quality.<br><br>Before I end this overlong diatribe, let me just mention three scenes that I absolutely cannot get over with in terms of their pointlessness and stupidity. 1. Batman is riding his wicked-cool motorcycle approaching an aftermath of a multi vehicle crash and accelerates aiming it straight at the Joker. What he is trying to accomplish is never explained. One thing certain is that at the last moment he veers right, barely avoiding the villain, and drives his bike without touching the brakes, straight into a wall. I mean he drives it into a wall (or overturned truck, can&#39;t remember) full speed like a blind man. Had he even chosen to hit the Joker, how the hell did he expect to stop? 2. This one actually occurs a couple of times at least. Batman leaps out of a 20th story window and falls onto the ground unharmed. Unharmed! He didn&#39;t have a parachute, a bungee cord, and he didn&#39;t even spread his cape on the way down. He just hit full blast and walked away. And on one occasion his squeeze Ms Dawes fell with him and experienced a similarly puzzling lack of after-effects. Filmmakers, needless to say, didn&#39;t find it prudent to even try to provide some explanation.<br><br>3. Joker enters the hospital in a nurse uniform. That should present a logistical problem by itself, but OK. However, not only he seems to move around the hospital freely, he also does it still wearing his face paint. I mean the lower half his face is covered by a protective mask, but the rest is clearly visible. What&#39;s even funnier is that Harvey Dent looks at Joker straight in the eyes and the face paint doesn&#39;t give him away until he takes of the mask. Is this a cartoon? 
very weak, unfortunately	Canada	I&#39;m very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, it&#39;s as if there&#39;s no obstacles the characters couldn&#39;t overcome by snapping their fingers. It&#39;s just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didn&#39;t want to be bothered by realism and it&#39;s one of the main reasons I didn&#39;t feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - it&#39;s contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we don&#39;t see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesn&#39;t matter cause there&#39;s an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* <br><br>The Joker starts with a small gang but in only a few days or so it seems he builds a big organization capable of operating rapidly without flaws - a group we are told made up of many schizos and psychos from Arkham Asylum, as if they had all been released all of a sudden to join him and moreover in doing so became hyperobedient and hypercompetent robbers / explosive experts / terrorists / etc. Yeah. Right. As if running a criminal organization made up of Arkham inmates would be a piece of cake. It would have been so much more REALISTIC and ENTERTAINING to see the Joker having to deal with nutty and sometimes incompetent henchmen and we the viewers doubting whether or not he would succeed and yet pulling it off and laughing all the way up to the last confrontation. Instead he surfs on the action, survives all kinds of explosions and crashes and moves around as if Gotham City was butter and he a hot knife. *YAWN* <br><br>Second, the style &amp; editing of the movie was mediocre at best. You would think the Joker&#39;s first meeting with the mob would have something of a tension. Here we are introduced to Batman&#39;s no.1 enemy and he tells them they have to kill the Dark Knight. But the way it was shot the scene was cold, he simply goes in, makes a few enemies and leaves. And next The Joker invites himself to Bruce Wayne&#39;s party to kidnap Harvey Dent and he simply comes in, Voil&agrave;!, without facing any obstacles, there&#39;s no buildup, no dramatic crescendo, the pace stays the same, we get lots of quick shots, a constantly moving camera and even one or two 360 degrees around Joker and Rachel as if this was some kind of music video. There&#39;s nothing, no tension. And it went downhill from there, like a typical dumb action movie. Explosion, car chase, car chase, explosion, fight, car chase, explosion. Can&#39;t you guys come up with something original? And those action scenes aren&#39;t even well made. *YAWN* <br><br>Why? After all you had an ace, The Joker, he should have had some cool crazy ideas to cause mayhem... but he didn&#39;t. He lacked the charisma that should be in such a character. Not that Ledger is bad but the character he plays has nothing special. He&#39;s cold, predictable and not funny. In Tim Burton&#39;s movie the man isn&#39;t just some psycho killer, you know early in the movie he&#39;s going to do his crimes with style and that he has surprises in his bag. He&#39;s a bit silly but you don&#39;t know what to expect from him - he&#39;s fun to watch. In TDK he neither has style nor surprises, HE JUST BLOWS THINGS UP WITH DETONATORS and he&#39;s not even having fun. Bbbooorrriiiinnnggg.<br><br>I think a lot of people don&#39;t see all the big flaws of the movie because they like the characters and the themes. I like Batman, the lone vigilante fighting crime in his city and his struggle to retain his morality while confronting the worst criminals, I like Harvey Dent&#39;s character and the Joker trying to turn Dent into a madman like him to ruin his crusade against crime and I liked the Joker trying to corrupt the people of Gotham and turn them into murderers ...BUT THE MOVIE SU CKS <br><br>I really wanted TDK to be good, good at least like half of Batman Begins is, I wanted to leave the theater with a big smile on my face but I left the theater feeling cheated because I wanted to see a cool movie and I didn&#39;t, I saw a lame piece of crap. There was no climax, no great scenes, no drama, no tension, no substance, only over the top action scenes we have already seen elsewhere. This movie itself isn&#39;t a 1 out of 10 but I&#39;m so disappointed by it that it deserves its 1 
Mediocre	United Kingdom	I completely fail to see how this movie could be considered, even at such an early stage &#39;The greatest movie of all time&#39;!<br><br>Heath Ledger is pretty good in it, but not that good. It is a good performance, but essentially he is just playing a pretty generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker. Christian Bale is completely wooden in his role as Bruce Wayne, Batman is a minor character. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are there to lend credibility, but do very little. Aaron Eckhardt plays the rather bland Harvey Dent, but again, not a terrific performance.<br><br>This is a ridiculous movie, based upon a ridiculous concept that takes itself so seriously that I found it painful to watch. The script is in parts cringe worthy. The plot is incoherent, there are no real character arcs, save for Harvey Dent&#39;s and it is very poorly executed. <br><br>The &#39;sonar imaging&#39; using Gotham&#39;s 30 million mobile phones was a real jump the shark moment.<br><br>The violence is extreme, especially when you consider Batman is essentially a children&#39;s comic. The movie revels in sadism and extreme violence, shame on Christopher Nolan for the glorification of this.<br><br>The art direction extends to a few Batman gadgets and some lo-fi emo make up on the Joker. No effort whatsoever was made to show Gotham as anything other than a generic American city.<br><br>Glaring plot holes abound, from dogs chewing through the bat-suit where as bullets have no effect to Joker somehow being able to blow up an entire hospital despite giving prior warning! Joker describes himself as an &#39;agent of chaos&#39; who just does random things, yet everything he does is meticulously planned. The joker has no real sense of humour, he rarely ever smiles which is a total deviation from the comic character.<br><br>This film - for me personally - signifies the death of the blockbuster. It might have made a vast amount of money at the box office, but i sets out to appeal to the lowest common denominator.<br><br>The Dark Knight is a humourless, negative, sadistic movie with no substance to it, a weak script, which as one reviewer pointed out that for all the pseudo-intellectual monologues and pseudo- philosophical rambling just ended up with someone getting punched or shot.<br><br>An immature film that should be for kids, but was really made for adults.<br><br>I don&#39;t want to see it again, it was a waste of time. This is film as junk food, it is bad for the soul. 
One of the Best Superhero movies EVER!!!!!!!	None	I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn&#x27;t, don&#x27;t waste your time write bad reviews about this film. 
Why so happy? Lets put a frown on that face!	United States	I know this review will get a bunch of unhelpful votes but somebody has to tell the truth here! The Dark Knight is wildly overrated and is the most overrated movie of all time. Forget Titanic, Boondock Saints and King Kong(2005). This movie surpasses them when it comes to sheer hype. For the record I love Batman Begins. I thought it was a fresh beginning on a series that was rendered ineffective by that lunatic Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale fared well as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and the rest of the cast did a great job also. But this movie.... Everything that made Batman Begins so great is absent from this pretentious slop. Most of the cast look like they&#x27;d rather be somewhere else. Let me break it down this way with what stinks about this movie.<br><br>The plot: Idiotic beyond belief. Joker(Heath Ledger) plans to kill city officials while playing childish games with Batman. Most of the time he&#x27;s killing the people he&#x27;s aligned with making him the most moronic villain in superhero movie history. Batman joins forces with Commissioner Gordon to stop him.<br><br>The acting: Christian Bale is wooden in both roles(Batman and Bruce Wayne). He spends most of the movie looking like he&#x27;s stoned out of his mind. And what is up with that voice? In Batman Begins he sounded cool like one of the gangsters from those old 1940s flicks. Here he sounds like Dirty Harry with strep throat. Aaron Eckhart is flat as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. While his Two-Face was better than Tommy Lee&#x27;s Two-Face looking good by default is never good. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman sleepwalk through this whole movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite awful as Rachel Dawes. Katie Holme&#x27;s Rachel Dawes was a strong willed lawyer that fought for what&#x27;s right. Maggie&#x27;s Rachel Dawes needs to grow up and find some better priorities. I agree that she is a step up from Katie Holmes but she plays Rachel Dawes like some silly high school girl with a pathetic crush on Bruce Wayne. The fact that we are asked to feel sympathy for her when The Joker captures her is a bit of a stretch. Her getting roasted made my day though lol!<br><br>Now for the talk of the town: Heath Ledger as Joker. Heath Ledger&#x27;s performance was okay but to say that he was better than Jack Nicholson&#x27;s Joker is hilarious to say the least. Jack Nicholson&#x27;s Joker had style, a plan and was pretty funny as well as unpredictable. Of course he was silly but he was fun. Heath Ledger&#x27;s Joker is predictable with no back story and had no real plan. Just random acts of chaos. Ra&#x27;s Al Ghul had a plan, The Joker of Batman 1989 had a plan, The Penguin of Batman Returns had a plan. This weirdo had nothing but bluff. Plus he&#x27;s has no fun with what he does and spends most of the time ridiculously philosophizing like those corny emo-goth kids that smoke copious amounts of cigarettes while yapping about the misery of their lives. You complete me? That&#x27;s about as cheesy as the Tumbler turning into a crappy motorcycle. Speaking of Emo-Goth kids that exactly what this Joker is. Only people actually find him cool instead of pathetic.<br><br>Action sequences: predictable to a fault. Car chase and fights scenes plus they are quite unrealistic. People get punched, kicked, shot, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without bumps, bruises, cuts or blood. Now, Im not a gore hound but if you get shot or bitten by a dog, I would expect to see some blood. Not in the Dark Knight though. <br><br>Pacing: The movie builds up a pace to slow it down after wards and with all the action on the screen the movie still finds time to be boring. Plus at 2 hours and 32 minutes this movie feels longer than it needs to be. Various subplots that never connect best describe most of this movie.<br><br>Conclusion: The Dark Knight is the most overrated, most hypocritical, most pretentious piece of garbage in the history of cinema. The only people that would like this are the fanboys and I cant believe that people are trouncing Tim Burton&#x27;s Batman movies to foam at the mouth like rabid dog groupies over this overcooked sequel. You pseudo-intellectual snobs don&#x27;t seem to realize that those movies were great for the time they were made in and they were fun. Tim Burton made the type of Batman movie he wanted to make without trying to please these shills. I must have seen the Tim Burton Batman movies more times than I can count and still have a ball watching them till this day. I saw this dreck three times and still couldn&#x27;t get into it. Its not even fun. Its a plodding mess that gets more hype than it deserves. Matter of fact, I&#x27;ll tell how much I didn&#x27;t like it. For months I had The Dark Knight on my computer for free via z-share and when my computer suffered from a virus that force me to erase the whole thing, this was the only movie through z-share that I never tried to get back. That should tell you everything you need to know about my feelings on this movie. Two Thumbs down. 
Erm...really? (may be a couple of spoilers)	United Kingdom	Wow. Once again my faith in the rational persons ability to discriminate between depth and breadth, is verified, in that I have none.<br><br>The film was long. Not deep. I think there is a misunderstanding. The film had the veneer of an epic film. It had all the right elements to be an epic comic-book adaptation to screen. Yet it faltered, mainly because everyone was so wrapped up in the idea of Ledger giving a career defining performance, they couldn&#39;t see past it. It&#39;s almost as if they accepted the brilliance of his performance before they entered the theatre, off of the back of the hype and the critics reviews, and all that was left was to actually watch it and be able to validate this belief.<br><br>Disregarding Heath Ledgers untimely death, can you really say that he was a better Joker than Jack Nicholsons? I for one, cannot. Others have already said it; he had no back story. A character without a past and a motive - especially when they are a killer - is just not one that is appropriate to a story about good and evil. The things we like about villains is that we can relate to the reasons they do the things they do, whilst asking ourselves whether their reasons are justified. We get into a dialogue, and we ourselves get to decide who we side with - the good or the bad. This villain left me feeling flat and unfulfilled because he had no real motive, - making it impossible to choose which argument, good or bad, I sided with - and left me feeling like I was a voyeur, watching a guy kill loads of people.<br><br>Everyone has been raving about the script, which I thought was plain dreadful at points. Others have raised the questions here. What was with his voice? He would make a great nursery nurse. The poignant moment on the boat when the sailor said something to the effect of &quot;They haven&#39;t pushed the button yet, because we are still alive&quot; was just plain embarrassing. The fact that Batman kept leaving in the middle of a conversation became irritating instead of cool and enigmatic. Why can&#39;t he just hear someone out. And at the end when batman runs home like Charlie, I was nearly dying in laughter. I could hear the music &#39;I&#39;ve got a golden ticket&#39;. There were other embarrassing script moments, but because the film was so bad, I can&#39;t even be bothered to mention them. The phone device for one was utter...<br><br>The rhetoric of the characters in their oratorical moments was again, limp. It was as if the writer had started a sadistic, flowing evil speech, but had not had the tools with which to really elaborate. Because he had decided to keep the Jokers background exclusive, the speeches were neither funny or scary. They were punctured and lacked conviction.<br><br>The fact that this is the number one movie is embarrassing. IMDb should take it off out of principle. If this wins an Oscar, I will never watch a Hollywood movie again. 
The Dark Knight Delivers	United States	The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bat&#39;s crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime group&#39;s looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.<br><br>The bad guys don&#39;t know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they don&#39;t really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Joker&#39;s personality is his motive. He doesn&#39;t care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.<br><br>Ledger&#39;s performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, he&#39;s focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Joker&#39;s humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.<br><br>Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledger&#39;s Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films I&#39;ve ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again. 
Fantastic!	United States	Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you haven&#x27;t seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. I&#x27;ll just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie I&#x27;ve ever seen 
Did you people see the same film I saw?	United Kingdom	Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Can&#39;t see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.<br><br>You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. It&#39;s a better film than this. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....<br><br>This may be the best Batman film we&#39;ve seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesn&#39;t move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasn&#39;t a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasn&#39;t been hyped that much, so where is this coming from? 
Not impressed	Maynooth, Ireland	I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didn&#39;t. Maybe I just don&#39;t get it? I&#39;m not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I don&#39;t like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isn&#39;t the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesn&#39;t like planning (because he&#39;s too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesn&#39;t, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like.<br><br>Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long.<br><br>On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didn&#39;t like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this. 
This movie was a joke...	Calgary, Canada	C&#39;mon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.<br><br>The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledger&#39;s last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.<br><br>To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that I&#39;ve just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.<br><br>Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. <br><br>This movie has no plot. &quot;The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham,&quot; is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why can&#39;t Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a &quot;civilized&quot; manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.<br><br>Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesn&#39;t give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes &quot;Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids,&quot; and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.<br><br>Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolan&#39;s vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfman&#39;s theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. <br><br>By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out. 
Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie	United States	Oddly enough, I don&#39;t go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that it&#39;ll be over-hyped and bloated; that&#39;s just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.<br><br>As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledger&#39;s unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isn&#39;t just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeare&#39;s finest plays.<br><br>Let&#39;s first get to what I didn&#39;t like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movie&#39;s predecessor, Batman Begins. See, I&#39;ve always thought the complex Batman character should be someone who&#39;s consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know he&#39;s got this secret identity thing going, and he doesn&#39;t tell people everything, and that&#39;s nice. Endearing, even. But Bale&#39;s inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that there&#39;s more than meets the eye. Bale&#39;s Batman doesn&#39;t feel like he&#39;s consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.<br><br>Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, who&#39;s a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because she&#39;s smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we don&#39;t see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday they&#39;ll get it right.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Jones&#39;s performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and it&#39;s like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart can&#39;t quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy who&#39;s better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dent&#39;s a noble crusader, the district attorney who&#39;s going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll who&#39;s there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, you&#39;d think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.<br><br>The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! It&#39;s not over yet! What will happen next? But surely there&#39;s a way to do this without producing a film that&#39;s two and a half hours long. If you&#39;re going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.<br><br>But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruce&#39;s conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because it&#39;s supposed to be gloomy ol&#39; Gotham.<br><br>So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. It&#39;s not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we don&#39;t even get clever plotting that we might expect from what&#39;s purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. There&#39;s much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - that&#39;s forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger. 
The Dark Nothing	eel, utah	This was one of the worst movies ever made. Never before have I witnessed a more confusing and convoluted mess. There were about ten subplots, but there was no main plot. The Joker existed to run amok and to represent the &quot;honest villain&quot;, that is, he didn&#39;t mess around and play games like most villains, and he didn&#39;t do it for money, he just killed and wreaked havoc for the heck of it... okay, that&#39;s fine. But in having the Joker purposely ruin all the other subplots involving other bad guys, it basically made all the energy in having to keep up with the subplots involving these other people come to nothing. It was very tiresome realizing that everything you witnessed, after two hours of non-story action and hammy performances, really didn&#39;t mean a thing, kind of like when a movie shows that &quot;it&#39;s all a dream&quot;. It might as well have been a dream. Because in this complete mess of a film, nothing mattered. The Joker had no purpose - which was intentional. But since the rest of the movie had too much purpose, or rather, tried too hard to have all the purpose in the world - it all came together like a big explosion... then, nothing. Just ruins. And two and a half hours of my life wasted. As for Heath Ledger, he wasn&#39;t terrific. He wasn&#39;t amazing. He was horrible. Weak. Sounded like a nerd. And he claims to have studied from &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; (please!), but he seemed more like he was doing a Johnny Depp impression, being silly and androgynous. It&#39;s just such a mess of a film. Horrible, simply horrible. And the reason I haven&#39;t mentioned Batman himself, is that he was so nothing, that there isn&#39;t anything to say about him. The main character seems more like a Vin Diseal character, and not a comic book hero. I understand trying to make the franchise more serious after being ruined by Joel Schumaker, but this film doesn&#39;t resemble a comic book in any way at all. It could have been a cop film, only the main cop had pointy ears, and the main villain had really bad makeup. 
warning contains spoilers, OVERHYPE, NON-EVENT	london england	How can a film like this be ever compared to a film like the godfather is laughable, i am a big comic book and superhero fan i particularly like this genre but i did not like the way this was handled whatsoever..the following points highlight my case why batman is nothing but a okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION AND CREATION everyone knows that one of the most exciting things about villains is there creation, and how they became they way they are, i believe the original batman films which Tim Burton directed handled this brilliantly, but look at Spiderman 2 which has a great villain. There was no flashback even to the creation of the joker character we must believe he has been there all along, as well as Two Face whos original coming of being i liked better in batman forever, not to say i like tommy lee Jones character portrayal any better than this 1.<br><br>2-VIOLENCE this film had left a bitter taste after viewing i am a fan of violent films but it can be seen the way this was edited to ensure the upper catorgory of a pg-13 12a(uk) over here left the film looking a feeling like something was missing. Instead of showing the conseqeunce of for example a bullet in the head the camera would cut away leaving it for the audience imagination, another example of not showing violence and actually changing the tone of the film was robocop the R rated version when compared against the X rated version which seems lighter in tone.<br><br>3-BATMAN now Batman played by Bale one of my favourite actors opted for a stupid gruff sounding voice which didn&#39;t work, also the suit castes were terrible and i mean truly bad, batmans suit made him look like a more well equipped navy seal or something, not the true mysticism that is batman which is lost in this film. There is no reference to bats whatsoever throughout the duration. Another letdown was the fight sequences which even though Bale did a lot himself did not look smooth, or good on the big screen.<br><br>4-PLOT/PACING<br><br>the plot has to many twists and turns and leaves some of the less cerebral most likely lost(not myself of course). The pacing is bad as there is one key action sequence in the middle of the film which did blow me away but the film never lived up to that particular sequence which is a shame, less morality and preachyness more ACTION! and on that note a spoiler which i do warn before hand, the ending i must say i disliked a lot, for lack of realism, depth and completion as it is left very much open of what happens to the joker character, my 2 cents please reply if you have maybe a differing opinion to mine, Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest comic book translations to films, as in the earlier batmans, (including returns) but this should never be uttered in the same sentence as a film like the Godfather, which i believe to be one of the greatest of all time, the greatest which i do believe is Once upon A time in America. 
Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water.	Hampshire, England	Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of &#x27;soon-to-be-Batman&#x27; Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: &#x22;you&#x27;re not The Devil, you&#x27;re practise&#x22; he hisses. The feeling&#x27;s that 2008&#x27;s The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.<br><br>That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing one&#x27;s very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist &#x27;acts&#x27; in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate &#x27;post&#x27; imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Joker&#x27;s videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, who&#x27;s under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.<br><br>In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldman&#x27;s police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gotham&#x27;s &#x22;white knight&#x22;, suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batman&#x27;s &#x22;dark&#x22; but is just different in technique and characteristics.<br><br>Joker&#x27;s parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gotham&#x27;s gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.<br><br>Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in &#x27;sonar vision&#x27; which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybody&#x27;s linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down. 
The film that seems to have fooled everyone!	United Kingdom	OK, lets get it out of the way, I&#39;m a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. I&#39;ve even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come I&#39;ve just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasn&#39;t that good. It&#39;s far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously it&#39;s painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledger&#39;s performance. I had my doubts when I first heard who&#39;d they&#39;d cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked it&#39;s burnt. Sure there&#39;s loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didn&#39;t give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. It&#39;s not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious? 
Too many  fans seem to be blown away	United States	Many commenters said they were &quot;blown away,&quot; so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? There&#39;s no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. That&#39;s the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.<br><br>Maybe I&#39;m beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? I&#39;m not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasn&#39;t (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in &quot;unexpecteds&quot; is trying to outdo the action mayhem.<br><br>When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. I&#39;m not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but can&#39;t agree with so many who rate this film at the top.<br><br>It&#39;s good and entertaining -- but too long. It&#39;s not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I don&#39;t mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom don&#39;t have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you won&#39;t be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment. 
This is seriously the best movie ever made.&#xFEFF;	Turkey	This is one of the best I&#x27;ve watched the movie trilogy. I don&#x27;t see TDK just as a superhero comic book movie because screenplay was written in a perfect way. Created by Nolan Batsuit-mobile perfect design. The most beautiful thing in the film to return to The Joker&#x27;s and Ledger as the Joker was created to be such an amazing acting. When good and evil sits down to have a talk like an interrogation scene, everyone in the audience shuts up and listens to what they have to say. That&#x27;s I think this movie is great. I just did not like the actor who portray the character of Rachel Dawes. Other than that Nolan and his team did a great job. They can make 100 movies but we will feel its something missing perfect acting, one of the best actors of all time nobody can be better than Ledger as the Joker. 
This generation is too easily impressed.	None	This cold, jumbled, autistic, overproduced mess is seriously considered some kind of modern classic? What is there to say? It&#x27;s just another big, dumb formulaic CGI action movie directed by another slick, boring Hollywood director. It takes a generation deficient enough in the cranial area to consider Pulp Fiction and The Matrix cornerstones of film to think that anything of artistic value can be gleaned from Nolan.<br><br>Heath Ledger sticks out like a sore thumb because there&#x27;s actually a sense of improvisation and life to his performance. I don&#x27;t care what a clich&#xE9; it is, if anything salvages this film, it&#x27;s him. But he doesn&#x27;t. We get Batman growling like a pubescent Solid Snake, poor pacing that gets you ready for the film to end like three times, tons of video game interludes--I&#x27;m sorry, I mean tons of CGI--and a big, dumb car chase filled with &#x22;hilarious&#x22; one-liners like: &#x22;not good.&#x22; Ha ha ha ha! Because, because, that&#x27;s understating a precarious predicament! Get it? That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s funny.<br><br>Just more Hollywood trash. 
Not Very Good	United States	I waited until the DVD came out and the initial media coverage had played out. This movie made money only due to the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. Throughout the movie I transitioned from &quot;when is this movie going to get good&quot; to &quot;when is this movie going to end.&quot;<br><br>Christian Bale is a fine actor and we were able to see his talents in the first installment. He had very few scenes where the audience could see these talents in this movie. He was regulated to the Batman Costume and his Clint Eastwood voice impersonation. This was unfortunate. <br><br>Heath Ledgers performance was good, but not award worthy. He kept sticking out his tongue while speaking to make his character look crazy. Gary Oldman has played much better bad guys in his day and Heath Ledgers performance does not match any of those or Jack&#39;s for that matter. <br><br>Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine but her role was so limited that they could have pulled all her scenes from the movie and the plot would not have skipped a beat. She is a fine actress but we did not get to see much of those talents in this movie.<br><br>Aaron Eckharts did an excellent job however his characters transformation into Two Face was rushed. It was kind of like they ran out of time and had to rush him into the bad guy role because they spent to much time elsewhere. <br><br>I will probably check out the third installment when the time comes, but I hope they get back to the format of the first movie. They let the the actors do the work in that version vice putting all the emphasis the superhero &amp; bad guy characters. If they are not going to let Christian Bale act then they can put anybody into the batman suite and it will not matter. This installment is also getting to the borderline where far fetched gadgets are concerned.<br><br>It&#39;s unfortunate this movie made so much money as it will give the production team a false sense of accomplishment. If they repeat this performance they will bomb next time around unless they catch another break with another unfortunate off set tragedy. 
Very Good, But Yikes, Let&#39;s Keep Things in Perspective	United States	Whatever else it may be, &quot;The Dark Knight,&quot; Christopher Nolan&#39;s follow up to his &quot;Batman Begins,&quot; the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. It&#39;s full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and don&#39;t let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film can&#39;t possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.<br><br>The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and it&#39;s through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledger&#39;s creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. He&#39;s not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.<br><br>I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and it&#39;s this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.<br><br>The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.<br><br>So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but it&#39;s still, after all, a Batman movie, and it&#39;s not the best film since &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; <br><br>Grade: A 
great but doesn&#39;t deserve to be compared with masterpieces	United States	Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. <br><br>But i see some people who don&#39;t mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.<br><br>Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. <br><br>But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks... 
Undescribable Perfection	Israel	Let&#x27;s open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be &#x22;152 minutes of pure awesomeness.&#x22; Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. It&#x27;s anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isn&#x27;t happy, but it&#x27;s flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batman&#x27;s loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I haven&#x27;t mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batman&#x27;s arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledger&#x27;s acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and that&#x27;s why it was so good. It&#x27;s simply impossible to describe him: he&#x27;s bold, insane, smart, twisted and he&#x27;s so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I haven&#x27;t mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing &#x22;Batman Begins&#x22; will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Face&#x27;s appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action. 
Christopher Nolan masterpiece	None	This is one of the movies of all time. There&#x27;s action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. There also enough emotion to round out the experience. The joker is one of the best characters of all time. He&#x27;s truly amazing. R.I.P Mr. Heath ledger. Christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. It&#x27;s truly a gift to watch them on screen. See this movie it will make you a better person.<br><br>The ending is perfect and amazing. Every time I watch it pick up something new. There was a lot of effort put into this. Better than batman begins but not as good as inception. It&#x27;s actually surprisingly under rated. 
Wonderful. How superhero movies should be made!	Australia	Quite simply &#x22;Dark Knight&#x22; is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isn&#x27;t a &#x22;proper&#x22; superhero movie, so let&#x27;s forget about that).<br><br>Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batman&#x27;s enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isn&#x27;t &#x22;just&#x22; a superhero movie. It&#x27;s also a study of character, of good and of &#x22;dark&#x22; and of perception of &#x22;society.&#x22; I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that it&#x27;s not. <br><br>Secondly, Batman doesn&#x27;t do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, he&#x27;s flying. Look at Spiderman, he&#x27;s got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. That&#x27;s all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesn&#x27;t have these &#x22;abilities&#x22; about him which are soooo unrealistic. <br><br>So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. <br><br>The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batman&#x27;s car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!<br><br>I won&#x27;t talk much about Heath Ledger&#x27;s portrayal of the joker. It&#x27;s definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. He&#x27;s just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!<br><br>Everything in Dark Knight works. It&#x27;s got so much novelty to it. It&#x27;s a rare piece of cinema where prima facie it&#x27;s for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isn&#x27;t for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special. <br><br>It&#x27;s cool It&#x27;s original It&#x27;s awesome<br><br>I can&#x27;t believe how it wasn&#x27;t nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him 
I was disappointed by Batman Begins, was expecting the worst, and i got the best.	Hungary	First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important? Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre, and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off, cheap junk from the above mentioned category, and it was only Batman, who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place, but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex, interesting and remarkable character ever created.<br><br>And to tell the truth, i wasn&#x27;t entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series, check it out if you like Batman, well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay, but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time, but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one.<br><br>Yes it has some overdone parts, some flaws here and there, a bit rushed and corny ending, but its good, meaningful, and Heath Ledger (who i disliked before i saw this) is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting, i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense, great acting, emotions, and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone. Especially for people, who think comic-books are sissy things for little children... 
The best Batman film yet.	United Kingdom	One couldn&#39;t help be sceptical of the hype surrounding The Dark Knight before having seen it, scepticism was certainly weighing on my mind as i walked into the cinema. I couldn&#39;t help thinking &#39;is this going to be as amazing as expected, or is the hype just an inevitable reaction to the death of Heath Ledger?&#39; I can safely say to anyone still having not seen The Dark Knight; the hype would&#39;ve been just as massive even if Ledger hadn&#39;t tragically overdosed during filming, The film is mind-blowingly amazing! The action sequences, The dialogue, the editing, the lighting, the costume, the score, the cinematography, The Ledger, The Bale, The Eckhart, The Freeman, The every-single-tiny-bit of cinema... is brilliant.<br><br>There&#39;s not the slightest whiff of the child-friendly-cinema that tore Tim Burton&#39;s vision apart all those (not many) years ago. Eckhart&#39;s Dent/Two-Face, blows Tommy Lee Jones out of the metaphorical water, the only shame is that his performance will be overshadowed by Ledger&#39;s even better one, and indeed his tragic demise.<br><br>Every insane laugh from Ledger&#39;s lips echoes with excellence, Jack Nicholson should be very very very proud. However, Ledger&#39;s delivery, commitment, presence and dress-wearing-ability far surpass the realms of merely paying homage to Nicholson&#39;s Joker. Nolan and Ledger really show Burton and Nicholson just how darkly immense the joker can be.<br><br>Not to forget Bale, who brings his portrayal of Batman (and the barking voice it brings) to the next level, the depth and inner conflict create an excellent empathy effect on the audience and also create ridiculously good viewing.<br><br>I could go on all day, going into every actors success, about how immense The Dark Knight is... but i think you probably get the message by now.<br><br>As undoubtedly one of the most difficult films to bring to the public, a film so swamped with hype, tragedy, death and scandal; The Dark Knight could easily have been written off with the tragic death of Heath Ledger, we should thank God that it wasn&#39;t. 
Bat-A-Man!	India	There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. It&#39;s his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but it&#39;s a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! That&#39;s why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.<br><br>A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath &#39;Joker&#39; Ledger!<br><br>The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batman&#39;s reach. And that&#39;s where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batman&#39;s life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?<br><br>Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when it&#39;s required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. <br><br>The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batman&#39;s grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. <br><br>Harvey Dent&#39;s character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point I&#39;m making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences&#39; spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says &#39;asta la vista&#39; and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! It&#39;s called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. <br><br>Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 &frac12; hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you won&#39;t mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies could&#39;ve been shorter and some lengthier but with &#39;The Dark Knight&#39; that&#39;s not the case. It&#39;s mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!<br><br>Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now I&#39;m expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. <br><br>As I said earlier, I&#39;m a big fan of Batman and after this movie, I&#39;m mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while I&#39;m rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours! 
Takes itself way too seriously	United States	Indulge me for a second here. Imagine that you&#x27;re a studio executive, and someone is pitching the movie to you. And here&#x27;s what he says: &#x22;All right. My movie&#x27;s based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city. In it, there&#x27;s going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died. And then there&#x27;s going to be this other guy who, for no given reason, dresses up like a clown, acts creepy, and goes around killing people. The bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands. Meanwhile, there&#x27;s this other guy who&#x27;s a perfectly nice lawyer, but then his face gets burned, so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has.&#x22; It sounds kind of funny and interesting to you, but just as you&#x27;re accepting it, the person suddenly coughs under his breath, &#x22;Oh yeah. And I&#x27;m going to take it seriously like it was Shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience.&#x22; <br><br>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went, but it seems to be a reasonable guess. Let&#x27;s face it. The whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous. It could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved. And yet, it&#x27;s still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life, and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across. How does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective? What does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil? Why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie? Give me the days of Adam West. At least his show made me happy rather than depressed. 
Just so...so bad	United States	It is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the Top 250. It is 2.5 hours of a coarse voice, explosions, cheap one liners, and terrible plot.<br><br>Batman Begins, I thought was brilliant. It had genuine pathos, its characters were very believable and had depth to them. The acting was phenomenal.<br><br>But this piece of crap, is completely the opposite. I have seen spaghetti westerns and children&#x27;s cartoons with better acting then The Dark Knight. With the exception of the Joker, by Ledger, who was decent.<br><br>There is no screenplay. There are explosions. I think Michael Bay actually produced and directed this.<br><br>There is a random side plot to Hong Kong that had no purpose or place in the story. The cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing I have ever seen in a film.<br><br>The only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of Ledger&#x27;s death. That plus the Batman and Joker fanboys that flood IMDb to give this crap a 10. They like how &#x27;cool&#x27; Joker was, and sided with him, and they feel bad for Ledger. A + B = in top 10 of IMDb.<br><br>This movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time. It DOES deserve to be an example of a horrendously written, poorly shot, poorly lit, pathetic excuse of a movie. 
A Plot in the Dark	United States	Why did I watch this movie? To observe the performance of the late Heath Ledger. It was not a disappointment but, like other reviewers, I think it was not one in a league with, say, John Huston in &#x22;Chinatown&#x22; or Bogart in &#x22;The Treasure of Sierra Madre&#x22;. It was more akin to Edward G. Robinson in &#x22;Key Largo&#x22;, not shabby, entertaining in a movie which is really not memorable at all. The noise of it would have been unbearable in a movie theater but I saw it at home and could control the sound level and fast-forward. I&#x27;ve only seen a handful of movies that shouldn&#x27;t have been over in ninety minutes and this one really didn&#x27;t even have that much content. The dialog seemed to have been pieced together from the dead bodies of older scripts. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman grace any film by their acting abilities but I kept waiting for Christian Bale to say, &#x22;Go on. Make my day&#x22;. Monique Curnan was notable in her supporting role. The rest of the major players seemed to be phoning it in. 
Am i the only one who thinks........Average?	Australia	OK now i was a big fan of Batman Begins, i really liked it but it wasn&#39;t really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for The Dark Knight.<br><br>First of all, whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written, to be honest i don&#39;t see what everyone is raving about. Yes Heath was amazing, but it gets me thinking was this due to the script? Or heath&#39;s ability to understand and become a phycopath? If it really is the second, should we applaud it?<br><br>Did it live up too all the Hype? Is Heath the only reason people went to see it? Is it the best film of the year? The answer to all these is of course..........no, and i don&#39;t understand why everyone is treating it like a god &quot;omg it was so amazing, best movie of the year&quot;, you see people this type of person is called a &quot;Hype Hound&quot;(by the way, thats copy written =]), a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film, and the first few reviews. Thats not to say there aren&#39;t some true fans who really did love the movie, but I&#39;m sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didn&#39;t even like it &quot;Conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will, free will is for those who break through conformity&quot;<br><br>Anyways guys my final words is, a great movie but not the greatest. Will Heath win an Oscar? Yes. Will it win Best Picture? Well lets just see 
Not as good as most people would have you believe	United Kingdom	The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that I&#39;m not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot. <br><br>Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), I&#39;m not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him. <br><br>My inability to empathise with the characters wasn&#39;t helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.<br><br>The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker weren&#39;t enough to keep the film going.<br><br>As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadn&#39;t been as good as I was hoping it would be.
