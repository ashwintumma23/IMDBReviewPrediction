The worst film made by anyone, ever, at anytime	United States	There are no words that come to mind after seeing this film. Travesty, horrific, absurd, ridiculous, and mind-numbingly stupid all come to mind but none of &#x27;em quite describe just how awful this &#x22;film&#x22; really is. To see where everyone went wrong, let&#x27;s break it down!1. It takes 45 minutes until the actual plot begins to develop. By this time, the majority of viewers have fallen asleep or have taken their own lives.2. The actor who plays Rod, Alan Bagh. He makes me miss Nicholas Cage. NO NOT THE BEES!!! AHHHH!!!3. The birds. What do they do exactly? Nothing. The birds come down and fly directly in front of the victims face. Then they die for reasons only criminally insane director James Nguyen knows. God help us.4. Read my parental advisory5. &#x22;Hey I thought I told you to stand back. These birds are contaminated&#x22;6. What is wrong with Rod&#x27;s friend? And why can&#x27;t he get a good looking girlfriend?7. The dialogue. It&#x27;s like watching a poorly translated foreign film. &#x22;I like you and because you are pretty to me&#x22; &#x22;I thank you this words they make me happy&#x22; &#x22;Yaaaaaayyy...&#x22;8. This quote: &#x22;Why would birds do something like that? Why would they just attack&#x22; &#x22;......I don&#x27;t know&#x22;-------The good?1. Thank god for Whitney Moore in lingerie. The only believable thing about this movie was that she got a job at Victoria&#x27;s Secret.And that&#x27;s my review. Go see it. I guarantee you will never see a worse film. 
A must-see movie.  Really. Im not kidding.	Raleigh, NC, USA	Don&#x27;t be fooled by the rating. You have to watch &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; at some point.This movies outshines &#x22;Troll 2&#x22; in every respect. It puts &#x22;Plan 9 From Outer Space&#x22; and &#x22;The Room&#x22; to shame. Imagine a movie that would be created solely to give film students a paper topic on how NOT to make movies. Every conceivable error has been made in making &#x22;Birdemic.&#x22; At first, you simply won&#x27;t be able to believe that the film is not a spoof. But if you read about the film and about Nguyen, and if you take a few moments to watch the additional material on the DVD, you will soon agree that this was just a misguided effort on the entire production team&#x27;s part.The sound is the most outstanding example of sheer incompetence. The director clearly understood what Foley is, since the gunshots have all been added post-production, but I guess they just didn&#x27;t have the time or money to dub the vast majority of the film after shooting. And it needs it. Badly.The acting is uniformly terrible. Not bad. Terrible. Alan Bragh doesn&#x27;t even rise to the level of fourth grade pageants. Whitney Moore is cute as a button and is aided by a bit of camel-toe in at least one scene, but she&#x27;s the best of a poor lot. All the supporting cast is &#x22;give your financial backers a small part&#x22; bad.If you want to explain blocking, editing, framing, sound markers, continuity, reverse shots, and other film terms to your friends, this is the film to use. None of it is done correctly.While the CGI (and I use the term in only the broadest sense) birds are hilarious, my favorite scene is the &#x22;retirement&#x22; scene. I think that the word &#x22;retirement&#x22; is used six times in just three lines. Watch for it. It&#x27;s hard to miss.BUT...it&#x27;s strangely watchable. In contrast to many bad movies, it&#x27;s not boring. Consider it a train wreck that you simply can&#x27;t tear your eyes from. Even the boring scenes (and there really aren&#x27;t that many) have some aspect (poor sound, hilariously unrealistic dialogue, odd things going on in the background) that fascinate. You&#x27;ll be giggling and poking your elbow into the side of the person beside you.So, go rent it. Really. You won&#x27;t regret it. 
Unbearable	United States	Where does one start? How can you mentally digest something like Birdemic? I am still in shock. I have seen some shitty movies in my time. But Birdemic, friends and neighbors, is the worst movie in the history of film-making, on this planet or in any other dimension for that matter. It is bad, OMG, right off the scale on the shitometer. The acting? Poor Alan Bagh, is he a living, walking wooden plank? Special effects? I swear, the birds are cardboard cutouts dangling from strings. For some reason, they explode when they hit something. Why? Why is that? Can&#x27;t somebody explain, for freak&#x27;s sake?Everything stinks so very gaggingly. A rhesus monkey with a camcorder poking out of its arse would do better. Beware, my friends, beware of this abomination that is Birdemic. 
a film for our times, for ALL times, or perhaps none at all....	United States	Sometimes there is a film that comes along that boggles the mind. You cannot believe the thing exists, but there it is, paddling its arms forward like a Special Olympics finalist (and no, this is not a joke on the Special Olympics - they&#x27;re too good for Birdemic: Shock and Terror). The movie tricks a viewer like yours truly; at first, having not seen anything made by its director, the inimitable James Nguyen - he has two other films to his credit, Replica and Julie and Jack, neither seen by me (just as well, one of whom gives its highest praise as &#x22;Ed Wood quality&#x22; on IMDb) - I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was really seeing, if it was either the highest or lowest of artistic expression.The film takes place in some sunny seaside community on the California coast - as we&#x27;re made PAINFULLY CLEAR in the opening from-the-car driving shots (immediately calling to mind the opening credits of Manos: The Hands of Fate) - and is about how Rod (Alan Bough) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore), who meet one day by chance, he a successful solar-panel salesman and she a Victoria&#x27;s Secret model (she just made the cover!) Oh, and there&#x27;s an almost inexplicable warning of a crazy-killer bird epidemic on the news, from, um, I guess it&#x27;s global warming. And after about a half hour of almost *nothing* going on between these two pieces of cardboard-as-actors, the birds finally arrive.... oh yes, how they arrive.What I mean by my uncertainty of what I was seeing, it felt like a double-edged sword. I kept thinking during the film, &#x27;either Nguyen is a total genius, crafting the most intentionally bad movie in recent memory, or he&#x27;s quite possible the most sickening hack you&#x27;ve never wanted to meet.&#x27; It&#x27;s one thing that the film was shot on a shitty camcorder. It&#x27;s another that the actors appear to be non-professionals or at best from community theater (Alan Bagh is so stiff he just might make your eyes bleed; Moore is too hot to have that happen, though her talent is just as nill).But it&#x27;s something else how absolutely, and surprisingly consistently, awful the film-making is. Even if you&#x27;ve never taken a class in proper lighting or sound or stage direction or editing, Birdemic shines so mightily in its crap-ness. Scenes start and end without a proper marker, as if the editor didn&#x27;t know how to flow from one scene- one SHOT- to the next. Sound is completely mis-matched from one shot to the next. The music is the kind of synthesizer work that cranked up loud enough could drive Bin-Laden out of his cave (they even go as far as to rip-off the John Lennon song &#x22;Imagine&#x22; for a girl character wearing a &#x22;Imagine Peace&#x22; shirt. And the birds... oh, boy, the birds (if you need further proof, watch the trailer, do yourself a favor and get it out of the way).Now, again, experiencing this film, especially in the case I had in a theater with people perhaps anticipating its awfulness based on the trailer or the website or the claim by Nguyen to be a &#x22;Master of the Romantic Thriller&#x22; (Trademarked. I&#x27;m not kidding), that this is perhaps just a brilliant prank, a satire of epic proportions. Certainly the &#x22;message&#x22; part of the movie- and it&#x27;s wielded with such a sledgehammer it would make Stanley Kramer look like Jim Jarmusch - is done to such a ludicrous extent, with characters appearing for walk-on scenes like a Old-man Biologist who appears to explain that the birds were caused by man&#x27;s harm to the planet, or the &#x22;Tree-Man&#x22; in the woods who has a tree-house home and finds the birds don&#x27;t attack him because he&#x27;s in the woods and not out on the road like the rest of stupid man-animal civilization. Not to mention the rather *listen to us now* attitude of the main characters driving their hybrid cars and seeing An Inconvenient Truth (I s**t you not, this is in the movie) and their silly solar panels. Who ever heard of that working really well? All of this could, potentially, really be just a put-on of such a magnitude that I would want to shake Nguyen&#x27;s hand for pulling off such a feat. But, no, Nguyen took himself very seriously during this production, only slightly changing his tune after the fact of people seeing the film like the audience in The Producers seeing &#x22;Springtime for Hitler&#x22; for the first time (if you need proof, look at this NY Times article quote: &#x22;I never went to film school,&#x22; Mr. Nguyen said. &#x22;But I did go to what you&#x27;d call the film school of Hitchcock cinema.&#x22;). I&#x27;ll give him that he had persistence in getting the film out there, even showing it in bars around the Sundance film festival when he couldn&#x27;t get in. The masses of sober people puking all around him should have given him a clearer idea of what he had though.Oh, don&#x27;t get me wrong, Birdemic is absolutely, hysterically, historically, gloriously funny. It&#x27;s a magnificent fresco of horrible CGI (the birds just float, like a screensaver), and non-existent acting, and plot that... wait, what plot? And who needs an ending that makes sense either, or shots that match up? It&#x27;s so funny that I ended up feeling just a wee-bit guilty by the end. It&#x27;s easy to mock this movie, like a bully on the playground mocking the kid with Cerebal Palsy. If the film isn&#x27;t an intentional anti-film, then it&#x27;s just a really bad Manos/Ed-Wood level movie, and all of the hilarity that ensues from it is kind of expected. It&#x27;s not even worthy of Asylum DVD status. Alongside The Room, After Last Season, and Severed Ways, it&#x27;s one of the real no-budget bad-movie finds of the past ten years. A must-see, for every wrong reason imaginable. 
The worst movie of the decade and probably the most preachy	Las Vegas	I just got done watching Birdemic for the first time, I knew it was made on 10,000 dollars and it is regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. This same day I also watched The Happening and The Crawling Eye (MST3K version) so maybe I was feeling masochistic. This movie was all around bad in every aspect. It looks like it was shot on a fairly cheap digital video camera and it&#x27;s obvious that the sound was recorded from the microphone built into the camera instead of a boom mic. I know that because the sound is very awful, the actors have to be pretty close to the camera to be heard right, and there&#x27;s way too much loud background noise which in post production they played a lot of public domain elevator music to drown out the background noise. The worst audio issue was when they film on the beach because the sounds of the beach are 5 times louder than the actors voices.The movie itself is very slow paced, the first half of the movie is just the main guy meeting his dream girl and building their relationship. The problem is that nobody in this movie can act and the writing was pitiful so what we get are very bland characters, not even vanilla more like tofu bland. We get no reason to care about these people in any way and to make them less likable the main guy has to talk about solar panels, hybrid cars, global warming, and even the war in Iraq as much as he can. The script is almost a love letter to Al Gore. This feels like an eternity where it goes from his boring job that he is way too enthusiastic about, his obsession with a greener world, and his dates.The second half of the movie is when the birds finally go on a rampage. Lots of 2D computer generated birds that fly around in circles and attack their prey by hovering in place while moving their wings up and down and making the same noise looped over and over the whole movie. Somehow these berserk eagles can set house on fire as well as kill people in one swoop. The couple ends up meeting another couple who lets them ride in their van, this van has everything from handguns and two AK-47 assault riffles with unlimited ammo (I&#x27;m guessing the van has Game Genie,) as well as medical supplies, and anything the plot requires. Most of the movie has these people gunning down birds and searching for survivors. The survivors they meet all have long boring monologues about how it isn&#x27;t the eagles we should be afraid of, it&#x27;s global warming and mankind&#x27;s use of fossil fuels that is responsible for this disaster.As far as the action goes, it&#x27;s about as lame as the trailer makes it look. When someone dies it&#x27;s just a bird hovering in front of the person and they fall down with blood make up on them. There&#x27;s also some really pointless scenes there just to raise the body count like a man who pulls a gun on them (even though they still have an assault riffle that they seem to forget about for the rest of the movie)who wants their gas, which they say cost them 100 dollars a gallon. There&#x27;s a whole lot of nothing interesting going on. At least companies like Troma can take a 10 cent movie and throw in lots of nudity, over the top gore, and comedy. The people behind Birdemic have the worst CGI effects since the old Star Trek movies and long speeches about the environment. If you watch it, bring some friends and laugh at it because it works in that regard. Other than that it&#x27;s Duck Hunt: The Movie. 
A joke, the worst film ever committed to celluloid	Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England	First of all, to approach &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22; with any kind of hope of witnessing a good feature film is utter lunacy. &#x22;Amateur&#x22; is a word a thousand times too generous for this film&#x27;s description. Even given its low budget of $10,000, the majority of which seems to have gone on car fuel, the film is a joke. The acting is unspeakably bad, the &#x22;special&#x22; effects aren&#x27;t worth mentioning, the music is corny and inappropriate, and the film&#x27;s editing techniques have all the marvel of a flip-book.The only way to enjoy this film is to treat it as exactly that, a joke. The above faults of the film are so glaring that the film becomes one huge joke that you can laugh along to. However, even this joke wears thin pretty quickly, and you&#x27;re left feeling quite empty, as if you&#x27;ve been cheated out of 95 minutes of your life.Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that it is the director James Nguyen who is having the last laugh, as he has created a film so notoriously bad that everyone wants to see it. Perhaps the joke is on us, and the director&#x27;s intention was to see just how popular this film could be through its infamy. Even so, absolutely nothing can forgive how bad this film really is. It makes Battlefield Earth feel like Star Wars, and makes the special effects of 1933&#x27;s King Kong look like those of Avatar. It is, quite simply, the worst film ever committed to celluloid.Watching the trailer, I actually had a decent laugh, and thought it might be worth it. But having watched the finished product, the knowledge that somebody spent $10,000 making this ugly piece of garbage and then having the audacity to call it a film is infuriating, and actually quite offensive. People were PAID to produce this. With MONEY. I still don&#x27;t believe it. 
Birdemic - Making The Room look like an Academy Award winning film	United States	If you have any chance of seeing this movie, do everything in your power to do it. This is one of the best &#x22;so bad it&#x27;s funny&#x22; movies I have ever seen. I saw an encore presentation in L.A. and haven&#x27;t seen a room of people laughing so hard in my life. It simply has everything one could want. Bad CGI (the animated birds in the movie are actually GIFs!), horrific acting, drunken cinematography, you name it, this movie had it. I typically zone out when watching a funny bad movie, the plot will lull and some things will get boring. But NOT Birdemic! This movie seems to be specifically tailored to ensure you don&#x27;t get bored! Out of all the things this movie got wrong, keeping your eyes glued to the screen, they got right. Encore James! Encore! Put it this way, this movie is even worse than my sentence structure in this review. Do yourself a favor and SEE THIS MOVIE! 
What a joke	Baltimore, Maryland USA	If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact that I was watching this dumpsterpiece movie with four friends, I would be bashing my head against something hard, and questioning the very usefulness of my life. In other words, yes, this movie was THAT bad. I&#x27;ve heard that Birdemic was supposed to be a very bad, very cheap rip off of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds, but Lord almighty! Fifteen minutes into it I was starting to panic.Rod (Alan Bagh), is a Silicon Valley software designer yuppie who has just made it big. Not to mention he always walks like he wears a back brace. He&#x27;s about to land a deal that will make him a millionaire, because this movie certainly won&#x27;t do that. Also, he drives my dream car (a Ford Mustang), and always drives about 20 mph below the speed limit. Have some respect, dude. But anyway, Rod goes into a diner and meets Natalie (Whitney Moore) by first asking &#x22;didn&#x27;t you go to high school with me?&#x22; Natalie is also a very hot blonde aspiring model, who just happens to give her phone number to a guy like Rod, whom she barely knows. That&#x27;s basically the first half of the movie, a romance blossoming. On top of that, there are stories about the ice caps melting, and swarms of eagles dying. Uh oh, does this mean Al Gore was right? One night, Rod and Natalie go to a cheap motel to have loving, but emotionless sex. All of a sudden, swarms of eagles are going around, swarming people, killing people, and blowing up houses by ramming into them like kamikaze pilots. Now, it&#x27;s up to this young couple to try to find survivors, and kill birds. Soon along the way, we meet Dr. Jones (Rick Camp), who tells us that we screwed up this planet, created global warming, and now birds are killing everybody.So .where to begin with this movie? First off, it has probably the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie that&#x27;s not a porno. I would say the acting was as wooden as Pinocchio, but Pinocchio actually DOES become a real boy at the end. There was no hope for this movie at all. I saw this being sold on blu ray for $25. I don&#x27;t even think this movie cost 25 cents to make! Just watch the trailer, you&#x27;ll know exactly what I mean. Everything about this movie sucked. The script was so badly written, it was almost a tragicomedy. At least Hitchcock&#x27;s The Birds had robotic birds. Okay, the CGI buzzards that were attacking people, I think the editing machines in a public access TV studio are more sophisticated. Plus, there were a lot of underlying themes about global warming here. If these environmentalist screenwriters wanted to convince me to stop contributing to greenhouse gasses, they&#x27;re going to have to do better that Birdemic. I seriously hope the filmmakers weren&#x27;t taking this too seriously, because it&#x27;s such a joke.I love B rate movies, and I like playing &#x22;Mystery Science Theater 3000&#x2033; with them. But this movie made Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. Some of these lines are so awful: &#x22;Humans need to stop playing cowboys with nature.&#x22; When people were attacked by birds, they were more or less being attack by a Windows 3.1 screensaver. I would have made a better movie when I was in middle school. What else do I have to say? Just go online and watch the trailer, that will visualize everything. I&#x27;m all for cheap filmmaking, but this is just pushing it.I leave you with this thought. I mentioned earlier that I was watching this colostomy bag of a movie with four friends, where we made sarcastic remarks. My thought is maybe this is why bad movies are made, why Birdemic was made&#x96;to bring in more social gatherings. 
really awful, but strangely entertaining	United States	Given that &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; has been blasted by many critics, I think I should say something positive about it to start off with. The scenery of Half Moon Bay is agreeable, for one thing, and Ms. Moore has at least a modicum of charisma; also, anyone who appreciates a stylish blue hybrid Mustang rolling along in a stately manner gets to savor that very sight in many lingering shots. All positive aspects of this film.Less positive aspects of this film are legion, so much so that I&#x27;m reminded of my wish that IMDb.com would allow a vote on a scale from 1 to 100 rather than 1 to 10 (in which case &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; would rate at least a 3 out of 100 for the reasons mentioned, and perhaps a 4 for meaning well (though the message about global warming comes across in a preachy and ham-handed manner)). Still, something about the profoundly amateurish quality of this film makes it feel a little unfair to rate it at all ~ in much the same way that it would feel wrong to grade a term paper on the basis of some rough notes jotted down before writing the paper rather than the paper itself. This film very much reminds me of a rough draft ~ a sort of rough visualization of what the film would have been if the producer had more resources at his disposal (thus making the upcoming larger-budget sequel all the more intriguing).Yet, I wonder if this film might have been less entertaining if it were better made. If it featured better sound, editing, writing, acting, direction and special effects, it might just be a forgettable homage to &#x22;The Birds&#x22;; its very flaws elevate (or should I say depress?) it to a special level otherwise occupied by a few special films like &#x22;The Room&#x22; and &#x22;Manos: the Hands of Fate&#x22; ~ the legendary realm of films that are so bad they&#x27;re good. So, giving it the benefit of the doubt as a real film and not just a rough draft, I tender my vote of 1 out of 10 and hope that other fans of this film will also give it an appropriately low vote and insure its rightful place on the Bottom 100 (once it gathers the requisite number of votes). 
Who needs a summary? Its Birdemic!	United States	This movie puts Puts Troll 2 to shame and rivals The Room... but I really think this one&#x27;s the best of the worst... ever.To truly enjoy this heap of hilarity, get yourself 5 or 6 friends with a 12 pack each of PBR and have a MOVIE NIGHT DRINKING GAME!Rules:1. Any time the camera pans, drink. 2. Any time the audio gets botched, drink. 3. Any time Rod walks unconvincingly (that&#x27;s right... you&#x27;ll know it when you see it), drink. 4. Any time birds explode, drink.Of course add your own rules, but sip small or you&#x27;ll be through all twelve of those cold ones in no time. Dear God this movie is fantastic. 
Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	Texas	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn&#x27;t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don&#x27;t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, &#x22;Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.&#x22; At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it&#x27;s technical merits - I don&#x27;t really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. 
Shawshank Redeems Hollywood	Paducah, KY	 Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich&eacute;s and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.  
Prepare to be moved	Westerville, Ohio	 I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie. 
A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.	Vancouver, Canada	In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were &quot;just happy to be nominated.&quot; Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word &quot;go,&quot; making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on &quot;that 'Rickshaw' movie.&quot; Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, &quot;it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.&quot; But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; &quot;In here's where you need it most,&quot; he says. &quot;You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.&quot; Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking &quot;that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass&quot; as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, &quot;It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.&quot; 
Two movies in one	Chicago, IL	The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.  I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.  However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne? 
The best story ever told on film	None	 I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: &quot;Get busy watching, or get busy dying.&quot; Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended. 
The Shawshank Redemption	Marietta, OH	 One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people &quot;will&quot; be talking about in 50 or 100 years. 
Powerful	Houston, Texas	 One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising &quot;twist&quot; near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once. 
Stephen King&#39;s best adapted movie	Toronto, Ontario	Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won&#39;t be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I&#39;m sure it could be number 1. So I&#39;ll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don&#39;t know if there will again.I&#39;m not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come. 
Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.	Long Island, NY	 The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 
Film surpasses the hype	United States	We&#39;ve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We&#39;ve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything that&#39;s been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, it&#39;s the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bale&#39;s Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox&#39;s inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It&#39;s not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker&#39;s stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could&#39;ve pulled something like this off. That&#39;s how difficult of a role this was, and that&#39;s why Ledger&#39;s performance is so great.This isn&#39;t an action movie. It&#39;s a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it&#39;s all in there. 
Surpasses "Begins" in every aspect!!!	United States	Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy "The Dark Knight" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the "damsel-in-distress" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than "Begins" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than "Begins." The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008. 
Best movie of 2008 hands down!	Netherlands	I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isn&#39;t just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his &quot;I will always be remembered&quot; movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you don&#39;t, then something beez wrongz with youz! 
Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait	Melbourne, Australia	I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the &#39;Old Days&#39; of Burton and Nicholson. Instead we&#39;re given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledger&#39;s performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than you&#39;d remember from any other film. It&#39;s impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why you&#39;re laughing.If Ledger wasn&#39;t enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gotham&#39;s &#39;fallen White Knight&#39; and Batman&#39;s direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones&#39; portrayal look like children&#39;s breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batman&#39;s &#39;conscience&#39; and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the &#39;majestic but unfinished&#39; tones of Begins - but it suits the film&#39;s tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasn&#39;t quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasn&#39;t what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasn&#39;t) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isn&#39;t already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous &#39;Superhero&#39; adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isn&#39;t campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that could&#39;ve been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly won&#39;t regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (I&#39;ll wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you don&#39;t like it, then that&#39;s also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us won&#39;t take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Can&#39;t wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray! 
The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted	SLC, UT	I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for &quot;Dark Knight&quot;.Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, &quot;Dark Knight&quot; ably stands on its own with or without &quot;Batman Begins&quot;. At a two and a half hour runtime, it&#39;s definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson&#39;s portrayal is true unpredictability. It&#39;s obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn&#39;t easy. How exactly does one take him down when he&#39;s woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the &quot;Batman&quot; animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts can&#39;t represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that we&#39;ve seen just the prelude to the Dark Knight&#39;s upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham City&#39;s dark underside.&quot;The Dark Knight&quot; gets a solid 10 of 10 stars. 
Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.	the big city	I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...?  It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary. 
Batman at his best and beyond	United Kingdom	Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batman&#39;s struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to &quot;confront everything he believes&quot; and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madman&#39;s campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he can&#39;t see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark &amp; sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels don&#39;t turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol &amp; Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasn&#39;t made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit &amp; vegetables on the screen. 
The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie	Memphis, Tennessee	(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Joker&#39;s plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledger&#39;s performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, don&#39;t ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledger&#39;s performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I don&#39;t think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10) 
The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made	Australia	I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolan&#39;s follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film &quot;Batman Begins,&quot; The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with &quot;Batman Begins.&quot; Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bale&#39;s tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bale&#39;s flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledger&#39;s Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batman&#39;s worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (&quot;Thankyou for Smoking&quot;) as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dent&#39;s love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaal&#39;s performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldman&#39;s Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfister&#39;s cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (&quot;Superman&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot; are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolan&#39;s flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!! 
The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie	Chicago, Illinois	I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why I&#39;m writing this movie comment this late is because I didn&#39;t wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I can&#39;t stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to it&#39;s hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batman&#39;s skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolson&#39;s performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like &quot;What are they, kidding?&quot;, once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! I&#39;m not going to compare Jack and Heath&#39;s performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heath&#39;s Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didn&#39;t know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that he&#39;s crazy, he&#39;s driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, who&#39;s previous film, Batman Begins, didn&#39;t really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know it&#39;s not real, people don&#39;t dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains don&#39;t name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, he&#39;s inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and he&#39;s going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gotham&#39;s mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the &quot;Classy Villain that Gotham needs&quot;, he also has brought a new thought into Batman&#39;s head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gotham&#39;s &quot;White Knight&quot; trying to put all of Gotham&#39;s scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyone&#39;s going crazy over Heath Ledger&#39;s performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heath&#39;s and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I don&#39;t wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I can&#39;t come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. I&#39;ve seen it twice in one weekend, I&#39;m going to see it three times this upcoming week, I don&#39;t mind one bit. I can&#39;t wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10 
Terrible Movie for Dictator Propaganda	Lulea	This shameful movie is about how government of Turkey is run by idealist. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. They not only change real events to their fantasy world conditions, they also used deceased engineers for their own propaganda.This movie is 2015 edition of Triumph of Will by Nazi Germany. I hope everybody will remember terrible people involved with this movie and cast them out from society. P.S. Did you know this movie is screened for free to the audiences by government with tax payers money? Shame on anybody who watches this crap. 
If you want to make propaganda, at least make a good one	Turkey	A really horrible film which only aims to increase support for the idiotic things the government did and will do. It implies that almost every bad event happened in the past 10-15 years is because of a terrorist organization which works together with CIA, Mossad etc. It is so idiotic that it shows the gezi protests like something that was controlled behind a screen by the same organization (which clearly doesn&#x27;t exist) What can I say, if you are stupid enough to believe these things (unfortunately many people are) you may like the film but that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it&#x27;s a poorly written and pathetically directed propaganda and a decent director could do something better while he&#x27;s in the toilet. 
This so-called movie is a propaganda !	United States	Shame on the directors, the purpose of this so-called movie is clearly politically motivated. The intention smells very bad a political propaganda reminding Goebbels. The movie presents the main non-fictional character Erdogan as a victim of a corruption case. North-Korea propaganda style. Many scenes are from political meeting where Erdogan shows an awful populism. Even the trailer is bad. Anyone can watch Erdogan lies on youtube instead of watching this movie. I would rate zero if that was possible. Keep your eyes away from that. Better to watch &#x22;the interview&#x22; which is at least a good comedy. Regards RK 
Terrible movie	None	Really awful. Don&#x27;t waste your time. if even they give you money to watch it you will regret and you will never take back that hours from your life. You will suffer and suffer. There is no subject on that movie I was lucky I didn&#x27;t pay because it was free I mean cinema was free. Can you imagine they put this movie free so. Ratings will be high. But I said even 10000 lira you will never take your hours back. I prefer to go and watch horse race or ice skating rather then this fully rubbish movie.i could sit and do nothing and still I will be more happy that hours than spend hours watching this thing. I mean who wrote this? Do they have a mind? Really? And how could you accept a role as a actor in such a ridiculous movie? Are you OK? Please tell me? Why did you do that to us? Why ? 
awful	United Kingdom	This was the awful movie I have ever watched in my life.Please tell me how it&#x27;s possible to formally review a film titled K.O.Z.Do not watch it. It is an absolute waste of time. It was also too boring. Also I paid 10 TL it was a waste of money. Than I heard that one of Turkish Political party giving tickets to its members for free. Highly political movie . It was produced in order to support the views of a political party. Also the the actors and actresses are not acting very well. I have never seen them before. Very small budget movie.This film is sure madness; a mess of epic proportions with so many odd features, amateur features, wooden acting, and loose ends that should technically derail the picture but, for some reason, do not. This is a charismatic film. One that doesn&#x27;t allow itself to exercise more than what it is. It&#x27;s silly, never boring, and embraces badness with a sense of lax, carefree fun. 
Worst propaganda film ever!	Sweden	This is presumably the worst propaganda film ever shot in the entire history of cinema. It gives a highly biased and re-written account of the recent political corruption scandals in Turkey; the so-called 17-25 December corruption and bribery investigations in the year of 2013. What happened in reality was that, despite obvious evidence, the barefaced government officials including the back-then prime minister (the current president of the republic) insisted to call the investigations as a coup d&#x27;etat, and produced a surrealistic storyline to cover the allegations. The film intends to prove the unbelievable and mind-blowing theses of the government. I admit, though, it would&#x27;ve been fun to watch for those who know the true storyline. Nevertheless, it is painful for me to watch it as I am a Turkish citizen and it reflects the unfortunate fate of my lovely country. The film is now free to see at certain cinemas in Turkey. Even worse is that employees of some pro-government firms are forced to go see the film.Do not ever spend your precious time to see this rubbish film! (unless you&#x27;re researching on contemporary propaganda cinema :) 
awful movie. dont waste your time.	england	This shameful movie is about government crimes. Which in fact is a murderer and a dictator. To hide their crimes, They say some people are betrayer. they also used deceased engineers for their own propaganda. People should not watch this movie to support human rights. Did you know this movie is screened for free to the audiences by government with tax payers money? Shame on anybody who watches this movie. If you want to support dictator governments and want to waste your money you may go to this movie. Please offer your friends that they should not watch this movie because of awful scenario. This movie really awful and my advice is to share this comment with your friends. 
Deserves to be the worst movie in the world	Turkey	If anybody is curious about this movie and wonders why there are so many negative comments about it, that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the &#x22;WORST&#x22; movie ever, I mean it. It&#x27;s completely waste of time, don&#x27;t even spend your time to watch it if you still haven&#x27;t. This movie itself is the proof of how much Turkey resembles Nazi Germany nowadays. Since Gezi protests shown the world how &#x22;delusional&#x22; Erdogan is, his only trump card (&#x22;koz&#x22; in Turkish, I mean &#x22;K.O.Z.&#x22;) is now telling lies to people about how aggrieved and &#x22;Muslim&#x22; he is, however, at the same time, doing everything he can to utterly destroy his dissidents, even promoting civil war in order to do so. By the way, this movie would be less terrible if Necati Sasmaz (Polat Alemdar) took part in it. After all, he is able to dodge a bullet by simply crouching down... 
The lies of a dictator	Istanbul	This movie is on Turkish Televisions everyday. Same fictional stories, same lies... Everyday we see internal mails from the employees of the close to government companies in which the managers threaten the employees to go to this movie and bring back the ticket if they want to keep their job. Turkey is passing through very rough times these days with its fascist government. This movie is trying to cover the billion dollars this government and their families stole (which are proved with many legal tapes, photos and voice recordings but darkened); trying to hide the innocent civilians they killed and trying to hide the evil leading the country. What is fortunate about this film for the Turkish people is that it is so bad. It is horrible and therefore no one will ever watch it in Turkey or abroad. It would have been a good movie with horrible lies but instead it is a bad movie with horrible lies... 
this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT!	Turkey	WARNING: curse words This is such a shitty movie for several reasons: * This movie is produced only to lie about AKP government&#x27;s false policies, theft and murders. Such as; letting Iranian spies to occupy the intelligence agency of Turkey (MIT), hiding huge bribery (%10 of every business built in Turkey goes to the president of Turkey, RTE), and killing innocent people against their benefit - like the politician Muhsin Yaz&#x131;c&#x131;o&#x11F;lu, and so on.* This movie is produced with the money of AKP government. They gathered the money from the bribery %10 of everything, then pour it into a financial &#x22;pool&#x22;. They support the newspapers, TV channels and a shitty movie like this with this money.* This movie is produced by an ideology, very similar to ISIS. They attack the very foundation of Islam by so-called representing it in this way of pressing, cursing, undermining, and killing - if necessary - all the people oppose to them.* ...the more I continue, the more I have to think of their rotten system. This makes me sick already.To sum up, this is not a movie. THIS IS JUST A BULLSHIT! 
You have to be a Himmatwala to watch Himmatwala	United Arab Emirates	You need to be brave, courageous and strong to watch this Movie. This more like a Torture than an Entertainer. Sajid Khan Claimed that this is the best movie he made. HE must visit a Doctor. Ajay Devgn shouldn&#x27;t sign movies which are remakes. It&#x27;s sad and disappointing to see a fantastic actor losing his track by doing these crap Masala movies. Well Now for the Movie Direction : It&#x27;s weak and not worth commenting. This worst Sajid Khan&#x27;s Movie ever. Dialogues are average. Looks like a 10 year old wrote it.Performances : Ajay Devgn tries hard but the script is awful. Ajay Is just okay. He looks convincing though. He has a one or two good scenes but that &#x27;s not enough. Tamannaah Bhatia is wasted . She is beautiful and has a screen presence but she is more like a Talking Doll. Mahesh Manjrekar is good. Paresh Rawal is the SAVING GRACE of the movie. His performance will make you laugh. Rest of the cast is purely average.Music : The original was famous for it&#x27;s music and it&#x27;s dance set pieces. The music isn&#x27;t great expect the 2 songs &#x22;Taki Taki&#x22; and &#x22; Naino Mein Sapna&#x22;. But the choreography is AWFUL.There are 2 item songs. Not Great.Action : It&#x27;s over the ROOF TOP. Senseless to be frank. Overall : It&#x27;s a Waste of time. Better watch &#x22;JOLLY L.L.B&#x22; or &#x27;Mere Dad Ki Maruti&#x27; Wait for It : It has A TIGER!!!! AJAY DEVGN FIGHTS WITH A TIGER AND WINS!!! YES A TIGER!!! OHH GOD WHY???0.5/5This is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!This movie can can be Compared his Sister&#x27;s with Tees Maar Khan and His Brother-in-Law&#x27;s Joker. 
Insult to the humanity/movie lovers....please ban this guy from making movies	NYC, United States	I usually do not write reviews as I do not have time to do so. But for this movie, I am still in shock and could not resist to register and write a review. Sajid Khan, as always is the worst director and a movie maker in the bollywood industry ( may be in the entire world). While watching the movie, I could not believe what I was watching. The movie was so pathetic that I was ashamed on myself for watching it. My confidence level has really gone down after watching this movie. Sajid Khan needs psychiatric treatment with shock therapy. I wish there is a class action law suit against him for making such movies, for mental torture and making people feel idiots. I urge everyone to watch this movie so everyone in the world must know how pathetic, poor, terrible, shameless director this guy is. but please do not spend money for this movie. 
One of the Worst Bollywood Movie u will ever see	New Delhi	Help me guys. Rate this shi*t 1/10 and throw pup on Sajid Khan&#x27;s face.Also thumb up the review so everyone can see only one line and save their time._______________________________Cant believe why Ajay and Pervesh would do such a film. This movie make Tees Maar KHan and Joker award winning movies. Hope Akshay don&#x27;t do his films in future. He thinks all of us are jokers wating to get fooled.Only Good thing is songs (those reused)are reasonablly well. Tamanaah look very good but cant be said about her acting.Cant believe why Ajay and Pervesh would do such a film. This movie make Tees Maar KHan and Joker award winning movies. Hope Akshay don&#x27;t do his films in future. He thinks all of us are jokers wating to get fooled. 
Insult to Human Logic	Bangalore, India	Climax scene, very intense. Son (Ajay Devgan) is getting beaten inside a temple compound by villains in front of his mother, sister and girlfriend. Mother, finally enters into temple and pleads to god &#x22;Bas Maa Bas, Aur Kab Tak&#x22;.Entire cinema hall bursts into laughter! I doubt there can be any bigger insult to a movie maker than this - he is trying to create an emotional scene and viewer is getting comedy out of it. If I could, I&#x27;d request govt to consider giving out some sort of award - not to the movie, but to the viewers for going through this tormenting, nerve-racking, torturous assault on human logic. I wish I could get my money back and sue the director for wasting my 2 hours.Well, this was probably the most confused movie I have ever seen. The treatment is pathetic and the entire movie is shot casually without any brains. It being a remake of an old movie (well, almost all the decently launched Hindi movies now a days are either remake of some Tamil / Telugu / Kannada / Hollywood film or some sequels like Murder 3, Jism 3, Race 2, Saheb Biwi and Crap returns, Ashiqui 2, Yamala Pagla Deewana 2 etc) always brings additional expectation of it to be slightly better than the earlier one. Not with this one. Forget being better, if Jitendra sees it, he might contemplate killing himself for approving such a shady remake.Movie starts with a street fight which is idiotically shot. Then suddenly jumps to a railway station called Ramnagar. Ajay Devgan gets down from the train with dress and shades of 2013 for a movie which supposedly is of 1980s. Meets mother - mothers tells some senseless story - they move in to their home and starts taking revenge on villain. I guess my narration of story is far better than how Sajid Khan has managed to display it.Presence of Paresh Rawal doesn&#x27;t help with comic quotient of the movie. Its ridiculously meaningless - but I guess we must have gotten used to it by now with Houseful and Houseful 2. I am yet to figure out why Sajid Khan is loosing his brain with each movie he is releasing. Hey Baby was a much better entertainer and after that, he seemingly has lost his sane in making movies.The tiger fight scene is absurd and nonsensical. In 2013, where CGI is so far advanced, the entire stretch is shot as if the director is running on budget crunch. Guess, it is more of a intellect-crunch at directors end than anything else.Well, not everything is bad in this movie. There are two good things - call them eye soothing if you wish - Tamannah, who simply looked fabulous, and 5 beauties dancing on &#x22;Dhoka Dhoka Dhoka&#x22; item song. The song is ludicrous (like rest of the songs and the movie itself), but I guess having 5 item girls helped a bit to glorify the screen.Should you watch this movie? Well, go ahead if you want to see how an illogical movie is made to abuse human brain. I lost my senses after watching this movie and had to wait 24 hours before I could gain some of it to write this apt review.In my opinion, you&#x27;ll be much better off sipping some drink and enjoying a biryani with that money in some decent restaurant than wasting it here. If you are not hungry, give that money to some beggar for god&#x27;s sake, better than wasting on it. You would not miss anything in life if you haven&#x27;t watch it - trust me! 
Himmatwala is not worth a ticket.	India	I clearly remember when I first saw the trailer of Himmatwala and at the end of it written A Sajid Khan Entertainer, I was sure that another trash from sajid&#x27;s kitty is going to see the daylight and this time I promised not to watch the movie in theater at least. Then finally i watched it in my Laptop and i was so happy that Sajid khan didn&#x27;t prove me wrong.Each and every scene and the nuances of each character&#x27;s depiction was so silly, unfunny and annoying that i completed the movie within 1 hr and 10 mins.The shocking thing was how could an actor like Ajay Devgn&#x27;s caliber sign a nonsense movie like this? just for the sake of 100 Cr moolah that could make a hat trick other two being Bol Bachchan and SOS. Tamannah, please go back to south and if Trisha fails to grab a position in Bollywood, then of course you can&#x27;t. Again as there are so many other bimbos flying high with success with khans without knowing acting then chances to sizzle on bollywood screen gets higher courtesy Sajid Khan.Sorry Jacqueline Fernandez. And yes Sajid, as you hate critics, so let me tell you am no critic and love Hindi films but know the difference between good and bad.And yes in a recent reality show where you were one of the judges,you were saying repeatedly &#x22; Your performance is like Sajid Khan&#x27;s Blockbusters&#x22; gone horribly wrong at least from the multiplex collections of Himmatwala. And Multiplex audiences are more of a class. Rest You can think yourself..Please No Himmatwala 2....EARNEST REQUEST!!! 
I dont want to believe this movie Really exists	United Kingdom	From The First day when I have seen first time seen trailer of this movie I know this was going to be a bad one. but My kid (5 year old is Big fan of the Singham...Mean ajay devgan with mucchhe) insist me a lot after seeing trailer with lion fight.I knew it was bad by the looks of it from a fifteen-minute review, but I wasn&#x27;t fully convinced. This movie COULDN&#x27;T be as bad as Ram Gopal Vermas AGG, right?? Boy, was I proved wrong.This isn&#x27;t of course an exact copy of Old Himmatwala (1983... I even don&#x27;t like that one too).... The director makes freewheeling changes both in terms of characters and situations. But no amount of tweaking can do much to save this piece of tawdry twaddle from being a complete washout.My massala Movie gore kid who even enjoy crap like RA-one, Is come out of Hall Silenced as he have seen ghost! Avoid this movie at all costs. Unless you like to watch movies that will give you headaches and begin to question humanity in this world, then knock yourself out. But other than those people, don&#x27;t waste your time. 150 minutes will be wasted from you if you dare watch this.The end. 
Pathetic simply pathetic	Pakistan	I just wasted 2 hours of my life for this crap. After seeing Joker and Tees Mar Khan i was expecting that those were the worst things ever happened to me but boy , Sajid Khan proved me wrong. This crap is senseless and a torture to anyone . U must be a real himmatwala to watch himmatwala (bullshit). Sajid Khan please use some logic before releasing a torture cell. Do not waste your time and money . Acting by each and everyone in the movie is pathetic. Ajay Devgan disappointed me a lot . Im a huge fan of him but he is a total waste in this movie. Direction from Sajid Khan is too bad. I think he was confused while making this movie and did not know what to do . Tamanna Bhatia is beautiful but her acting was not up to the mark. Paresh Rawal is way out of his own league in this flick. In a nut shell this movie is going to be the biggest flop of this year. 
HIMMATWALA is the one who can watch this movie second time...	India	I usually don&#x27;t watch such movies but I don&#x27;t know what it was that convinced me to watch this one... The movie touched each and every aspect of boredom. In fact, the movie sets a new benchmark in the field of irksomeness. The movie starts with a song featuring Sonakshi. Well, no comments on that. Then comes a (practically impossible)fight scene. There you get a glimpse of what this movie is going to be. Then comes Paresh Rawal&#x27;s character. The character played by this great actor was the most irritating, annoying, aggravating, abrading (idk add some more words) character I had ever seen in my entire life. The same goes with Mahesh Manjrekar&#x27;s character. Ajay&#x27;s and Tamanna&#x27;s characters were so-so. Now, Good and bad aspects of this film: BAD- 1. &#x27;Dangerously&#x27; uninteresting story. 2. Super Boring songs. 3. Irritating comedy. 4. Impractical fight sequences. GOOD- ... ...(plz suggest if you find some)The movie has the potential of making you feel like going home (multiple times). This movie, as rightly said in the other review, &#x22;questions humanity in this world.&#x22; Sajid Khan himself is not capable of watching movies like this (provided it is not made by him). But this movie can be used as &#x27;an April fool&#x27;s day prank&#x27;. You can tell your friend that the movie is awesome and send him to watch this piece of s***...And I&#x27;m sure your friend will never forget that...P.S.-You still go to watch this movie after reading this....then you are an IDIOT 
bad totally bad movie of this year	India	this is not at all good movie compare to sajid khans previous movies. this movie is tool long .only good thing about this movie is its remake of 1983 movie - himatwala.this movie is full of stupidity comedy which does not make audience laugh at all.i would give 1 and half out of 5. Fashioned exactly on the same story as its 1983 saga, the story is typical of that era.I don&#x27;t think anyone except Sajid Khan could have found the script of Himmatwala interesting.In the film, perhaps the most notable moment was Ajay&#x27;s fight sequence with the tiger that leapt out straight from the sets of Ang Lee&#x27;s Life of Pi.Personally, the film made me miss the intense and passionate actor Ajay Devgn was, before mindless comedies got the better of him! He is obviously way more Himmatwala than Jeetendra was and performs his stunts with inexplicable exhibition of power and strength. 
Himmatwala:A Idiotic piece of work by Sajid Khan in the name of  Entertainment!	Bahrain	Himmatwala directed by Sajid Khan is one of the worst remakes I have ever seen.The 1983&#x27;s Jeetendra-Sridevi&#x27;s Himmatwala was entertaining while 2013&#x27;s Ajay Devgn-Tammanah&#x27;s Himmatwala is horror offered to the audience in the name of entertainment.While the movie has a running time of 150 minutes,I could not endure this nonsense for more than an hour and I had to leave the theater!The action sequences,too,are boring,because they are the same repetitive action scenes which we have seen in many movies before.The direction by Sajid Khan is done to death.The screenplay is badly written.The music is sonorous.The dialogs written by Sajid-Farhad are awful.Performances: Ajay Devgn is strictly okay.Tamannah overacts.Mahesh Manjrekar is fine.Asrani hams and is wasted in a small role.Special mention of Paresh Rawal,who steals the show with his fabulous performance!All in all,Himmatwala directed by Sajid Khan is an Idiotic piece of work presented to the audience in the name of Entertainment!I am giving it a generous one on ten(Solely for Paresh Rawal). A Disappointment! 
The Godfather is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made	United Kingdom	Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint. 
Magnificent portrait of organized crime	EU	 This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a &quot;must see&quot; masterpiece. 
Another kind of family movie	nowhere	 The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for &quot;gangster movies&quot;, but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every &quot;organized crime film&quot; nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply &quot;influential&quot; is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as &quot;a movie about gangsters&quot;. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his &quot;innocence&quot; and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos&eacute; of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.  
perfect	Winnipeg	 This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. 
The Greatest Movie Ever Made	Yorktown	 The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy. 
Initially, I wasn&#39;t a fan... but then I realised	Australia	This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn&#39;t like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando&#39;s ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don&#39;s children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they&#39;re put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character&#39;s character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn&#39;t to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn&#39;t mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability. 
The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!	Worcester, England	&#x27;The Godfather&#x27; is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed &#x27;The Godfather&#x27; I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let&#x27;s start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, &#x27;I believe in America&#x27;, it&#x27;s crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film&#x27;s &#x22;threshold&#x22;. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970&#x27;s film industry (including a certain horse&#x27;s head), &#x27;The Godfather&#x27; epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone&#x27;s are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made. 
A Masterpiece	Casa Nostra	This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man&#39;s reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film! 
This Movie Has Haunted My Life...	United States	I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him. 
The world inside the underworld!	United States	The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, &quot;Oh that was 10 out of 10.&quot; If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy 
To call it a sequel is a travesty	None	 This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .Watch this movie and learn why it is the greatest gangster film of all time.  
The Greatest Film Ever Made	Canada	 The original Godfather is a brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality. It was the highest grossing movie of its time and Brando created a cultural icon whose influence resonates as strong today as it did in 1972.As extraordinary an achievement as this is, Part II is even better. It easily receives my nod as the best picture ever made. I have seen it at least 20 times, and each time its 200 minutes fly by.The movie uses flashbacks to brilliantly weave two tales. The main story is the reign of Michael Corleone as the world's most powerful criminal. Now reaping the benefits of legalized gambling in Las Vegas, Michael is an evident billionaire with an iron fist on a world of treachery.Behind this, Director Francis Ford Coppola spins the tale of the rise of Michael's father, Vito, to the center of the New York mafia. It is these scenes that make the film a work of art. Without spoiling, I will simply say the Robert DeNiro as the young Vito is the best acting performance of all time, a role  for which he won a richly deserved Oscar.The screenplay is full of delicious little underworld nuggets (&quot;Keep your friends close .....&quot;, &quot;I don't want to kill everyone, just my enemies&quot;), while it blows a dense, twisted plot past you at a dizzying and merciless pace. The cinematography is depressing and atmospheric. The score continues in the eerie role of its predecessor, foretelling death and evil.All of this makes the movie great and infinitely watchable. But it's what's deeper inside this film ... what it is really about ... that is its true genius.The Godfather Part II is not really a movie about the mafia, it is a movie about a man's life long struggle. Michael controls a vast empire that is constantly slipping out of his hands. He grows increasingly distrustful and paranoid, and even shows signs that he hates his own life. Michael almost seems to resent the fact that he is a natural born crime lord, a man who puts the family business ahead of everything.The great Don Michael Corleone can never come to terms with one simple fact.... his father's empire was built on love and respect, Michael's empire is built on fear and violent treachery.See this movie. It's three-and-a-half hours very well spent. 
One of the Best Sequels Ever	Canada, ontario	 You can count on one hand the movie sequels that measure up to the original; GODFATHER II makes the cut. This movie is just as fine as GODFATHER I. Here the director goes back and forth between the early days of the young Vito Corleone, played by Robert De Niro, and the family after the action in GODFATHER I in the 1950's just before Castro came to power. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) has moved the family and most of his business to Nevada. Once again the acting is flawless. Diane Keaton as Michael's wife who quickly becomes disillusioned with her life with him and the lies he continues to tell her, assuring her that he is going legitimate soon; Robert Duvall as Michael's adopted brother and adviser; and Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth all give outstanding performances; but the film really is Al Pacino's. We see him become a ruthless, cold-blooded killer who alienates himself from his family in ways his father would never have done. He has come so far from the idealistic young man in &quot;GODFATHER I, who joined the Marines in World War I to serve his country and die for it if necessary, to a lonely, paranoid tragic man. There are many poignant scenes concerning his wife and children-- the drawing his son leaves for him in his bedroom, the gift that Tom buys the child because Michael is too busy, his wife Kay's being kept a virtual prisoner at his orders in the family compound, etc.Once again many acts of violence are interwoven with religion: Michael's son's first communion, the religious parade in New York, Fredo's repeating the Rosary in order to catch a fish, for example. The cinematography is stunning; the footage from Sicily and New York around the turn of the century and the snow scenes from the American West are beautiful and rich in detail. Mr. Coppola has directed yet another masterpiece.  
Great ensemble acting, great story, greatest sequel ever made.	Derbyshire, UK	 The Godfather Part 2 is the finest sequel ever made and is arguably a finer film than the original Godfather. The film is divided into two main parts - the story of a young Vito Corleone (flawlessly acted by Robert De Niro and a worthy Oscar winner) and the rise to power of Michael as the head of the family. Francis Coppola recollaborated with many of the crew members of the first film and again achieves a quite superb period piece thanks to the cinematography of Gordon Willis and set design of Dean Tavoularis. The acting performances are outstanding, hence three supporting oscar nominations for acting guru Lee Strasberg (Hyman Roth), Michael Gazzo (Frank Pentangeli) and Robert De Niro (young Vito Corleone). Duvall, Keaton, Cazale and Shire all provided first rate performances but it is the performance of Al Pacino which steals the show, expertly portraying Michael as a cool, calculating, suspicious Don Corleone. The film expands upon the original movie and brings us into the family's activities in Nevada, Florida and Havana. Arguably the finest movie of the 70s, a cinematic masterpiece with the greatest ensemble acting you will probably see. 
Breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur...	Mexico	Coppola's masterpiece is rivaled only by &quot;The Godfather, Part II&quot; in which the 1940s setting of the first movie is extended backwards and forwards to reveal the corrupting effect of power...The film, breathtaking in its scope and tragic grandeur, shows two parallel stories extending two different time periods: the early career of young Vito Corleone seen first around the turn of the 20th century in Sicily, and then in 1917, building his criminal underworld in the Italian ghettos of New York City, post World War I, plus that of his son, Michael (Al Pacino) desperately trying to keep his family together...Al Pacino's performance is quiet and solemn... He is cold and ruthless, with a whole contrast from the idealistic innocent war hero we initially met at the beginning of the first film... Here he's a calculating and frightening force, seeking to expand casinos into Pre-Revolutionary Cuba and consolidating an empire surrounded by perfidy and treason, maintaining total confidence in his ability to control the situation whether testifying before enraging Senators or trying to outface his worst enemies...The film's haunting final shot of a lonely, isolated paranoid Michael in his empty compound, is an unforgettable movie scene, a tragic portrait of a lonely and fully damned person, emotionally empty and finished, far from a waspish wife, more distant from a faithful lawyer...De Niro's rise, from an orphan child by a family feud back in Italy to a hood in New York and his position as a respected Don, provides a welcome break from Pacino's relentless attitude... Since the people he kills seem to deserve it, Vito comes off better than Michael does, and it was wise of Coppola to shuffle the two stories together despite lengthy flashbacks and the disturbance of continuity...The entire cast contributes greatly to the success of the film: Lee Strasberg, a fascinating mixture of lust and ruthlessness; G. D. Spradlin, absolutely right as the sinister and corrupt Nevada Senator; Michael V. Gazzo, unforgettable as the troubled gray-haired informer; Gastone Moschin, excellent as the blackmailer in white suit; John Cazale, marvelously timid as the vague, confused, and hesitant Fredo; Diane Keaton, clearly irrational as the long-suffering wife Kay; Talia Shire, too extravagant as the lousy mother; Troy Donahue too ambitious as the fortune-hunting suitor; and Robert Duvall excels as the confidant, and retainer to the all-powerful Corleone family...Coppola's motion picture is not just a mere supply with new characters and events from the original, it's a far more complex and intimate movie than its predecessor... It is not really a sequel... It's just more... It cleverly shifts in time between two distinct narratives with extreme realistic violence and criminal mentality of gangsters... 
The Godfather Part II is the greatest sequel ever made, one of the greatest films of all time and possibly finer than its superb predecessor *****	United Kingdom	The Godfather Part II (1974)Number 1 - 1974Top 3 - 1970s&quot;My father taught me many things. Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer&quot;&quot;The Godfather Part II is truly a masterpiece. Timeless, Classic, Beautiful and endlessly watchable&quot;The second part of Francis Ford Coppola&#39;s Epic and violent Gangster Trilogy, follows the reign of Don Michael Corleone as the head of the Corleone family. As well the film shows us the early years of Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) played flawlessly by Academy Award Winner Robert De Niro, and how he created his empire of money, gambling and respect. Beautifully directed by Francis Ford Coppola, Godfather Part II exceeds every expectation with outstanding performances from Academy Award winners Al Pacino,Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro. The second part of this unforgettable trilogy is one of the finest films ever made. This is cinematic art. A treasure of film history. The finest sequel ever made. A faultless, flawless gripping drama; Coppola&#39;s second part of his crime saga is in my opinion one of the top 5 films of all time and perhaps towering over the first part. &quot;As close to perfection as movies get&quot;&quot;Pacino at his best&quot;-10/10- 
Excellent, but could be in the dictionary under sprawl	New York City	Series note: It is almost unthinkable to watch this film without having seen The Godfather (1972) first. This is a direct continuation of that story.The good news is that The Godfather Part II has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances from a superb cast, sublime, unprecedented visuals that no one else has been able to capture since, and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall. Because it should have been a 10, and most other reviews will tell you about the positive points at length, I may pick on more things in my review than you would think I would for a 9, but rest assured that even with the flaws, The Godfather Part II is still essential viewing.Director/co-writer Francis Ford Coppola cleverly begins the film with parallels to The Godfather. We see Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) &quot;in the role&quot; of his father, Vito (Marlon Brando), from the first film, accepting prostrating guests while a party is going on outside. Like the first film, the party consumes a lot of time while we get to know some of the principal characters. Perhaps during this segment, perhaps a bit after, we realize that maybe the beginning wasn't so clever after all, because the structure of The Godfather Part II parallels The Godfather from a broad perspective, as if Coppola and co-writer Mario Puzo used the first film as something of a template to create this one.After the party is over, there is an attempted hit on Michael, and we quickly learn that not everything is rosy in the Corleone's mafia world. Michael believes that someone on the &quot;inside&quot; was involved with the hit. This launches a complicated sequence of events that has Michael, who is now living in Nevada, traveling to Miami, Cuba, New York, and so on. He accuses different people of involvement in the attempted hit depending on whom he is talking to. This may have all been part of a grand scheme to set up the responsible parties, but one of the flaws of the film is that Coppola doesn't convey Michael's underlying thoughts about this very well, not even later, and not through his actions. Rather than feeling like a clever set-up, it starts to feel like slightly muddled writing.During the middle section of the film, which goes on for hours, we also have a hint of a problem that plagued The Godfather--a bloated cast. There are bit too many characters who aren't well enough presented or explained. You may need to keep a scorecard.Coppola and Puzo also treat us to many extended &quot;flashback&quot; segments, and I mean way back, to Vito as a boy and young man, played by Robert De Niro. For my money, these were the best scenes of the film, although maybe that's a bit of my bias creeping in, as I'm a huge De Niro fan.But let's talk about the main plague of the film--sprawl. This is maybe first evident in the flashbacks. As good as they are, they go on far too long, and happen far too frequently, to sustain the momentum of either the Michael story or the Vito-as-a-youngster story. It begins to feel like we're toggling back and forth between two films, which is the track that should have been taken. The prequel, at least, would have been a solid 10.There's also a lot of sprawl in the Michael Corleone segments. Coppola appears to have been suffering from what I'd now call &quot;J.K. Rowling Syndrome&quot;. That happens when an artist becomes successful enough that they can fire or ignore their editor(s). Instead of taking good advice about where to trim fat, the artist decides to just leave much of it in, and they now have the clout to override any dissenting and more sensible opinions. The Michael Corleone story has a lot of fat, including much of the Cuba material (for example, sitting around the table with the President, laboriously passing around a solid gold telephone), the Senate hearings (which go on far too long to make and provide the dramatic points), and so on.The film begins to feel more like a couple seasons of a television show that Coppola tried to cram into a 3 and a half hour film, or worse, a collection of deleted scenes. The scenes, except for the fat that needed to be trimmed, are excellent in isolation. But by the time the climax rolls around, the whole has more of an arbitrary feeling--this is especially clear in the d&eacute;nouement, which seems to just end.I've barely left myself room to talk about the good points. The first one, which most people mention, is the acting. There isn't a bad performance in the film, but Pacino, De Niro, and some relatively minor characters, like those played by Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and John Cazale, really stand out.The second outstanding point, similar to the first film, is the beautiful visuals. Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes. It must be incredibly difficult to achieve without making the shots too dark, because I can't remember another film since that has been able to capture the same look. The flashback scenes are also in similar, but lighter, colors, creating an appropriate sepia-tone feel.Although the broad perspective problems are unfortunate, a closer focus on most segments of the film provides exemplary artistry. Given that, and the film's importance culturally, The Godfather Part II is a must-see. 
A Masterpiece	United States	The Godfather Part Two is possibly the best film ever made, every part of this film is amazing, it is even better than the original, I was very surprised by this. The story is amazing, everything makes perfect sense. The Oscar winning screenplay is amazing, the dialogue is some of the most original, and realistic ever putt on screen, the characters are flawless, and it's in every way perfectly written. The acting is just as fantastic, I can't believe Al Pacino lost the Oscar, and for once Robert De Niro was even better, he was truly amazing, and interestingly he fails to say a single word in English. The direction is also amazing, Francis Ford Coppola even does a better job than he did in The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now. The visual effects are so much better than the amazing one's in the original Godfather. One of the best films ever, a must see. Flawless. 
One of the greatest sequels ever made	United States	 After seeing The Godfather and improving it as one of my favorite films, I wanted to get more into The Godfather so I rented this. Words can't describe how great this sequel was. The acting once again was amazing and the story and how the movie went on just never got me bored. Everything in this movie was clearly beautiful. The ending by far was my favorite when there all sitting at the table talking. There were so many great scenes like Vito when he was younger, Fredo at the lake, and many many more. You have to see this movie because it's just brilliant filmaking. It's not better than it's first film but still an extremely worth sequel.10/10  
A Hollywood Masterpiece!!!!	USA	 Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo continue their epic saga into the lives of the infamous Corleone family, which is headed by Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  It is a film which does better than its predessor, &quot;The Godfather&quot;.  The film flip-flops graciously and beautifully between Michael's struggle over the family business and the life of young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro, in a brilliant, Oscar-winning performance) in his rise to power as well.  Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Lee Strassberg, and John Cazale give excellent supporting performances.  Carmine Coppola's and Nino Rota's score is a masterpiece of music.  The movie is expertly filmed and the cinematography is superb. 
The masterpiece without a message	Baltimore, MD	One of the early scenes in Pulp Fiction features two hit-men discussing what a Big Mac is called in other countries. Their dialogue is witty and entertaining, and its also disarming, because it makes these two thugs seem all too normal. If you didn't know better, you might assume these were regular guys having chit-chat on their way to work. Other than the comic payoff at the end of the scene, in which they use parts of this conversation to taunt their victims, their talk has no relevance to anything in the film, or to anything else, for that matter. Yet without such scenes, Pulp Fiction wouldn't be Pulp Fiction. I get the sense that Tarantino put into the film whatever struck his fancy, and somehow the final product is not only coherent but wonderfully textured.Its no wonder that fans spend so much time debating what was in the suitcase, reading far more into the story than Tarantino probably intended. The film is so intricately structured, with so many astonishing details, many of which you wont pick up on the first viewing, that it seems to cry out for some deeper explanation. But there is no deeper explanation. Pulp Fiction, is, as the title indicates, purely an exercise in technique and style, albeit a brilliant and layered one. Containing numerous references to other films, it is like a great work of abstract art, or art about art. It has all the characteristics we associate with great movies: fine writing, first-rate acting, unforgettable characters, and one of the most well-constructed narratives I've ever seen in a film. But to what end? The self-contained story does not seem to have bearing on anything but itself.The movie becomes a bit easier to understand once you realize that its essentially a black comedy dressed up as a crime drama. Each of the three main story threads begins with a situation that could easily form the subplot of any standard gangster movie. But something always goes wrong, some small unexpected accident that causes the whole situation to come tumbling down, leading the increasingly desperate characters to absurd measures. Tarantinos originality stems from his ability to focus on small details and follow them where they lead, even if they move the story away from conventional plot developments.Perhaps no screenplay has ever found a better use for digressions. Indeed, the whole film seems to consist of digressions. No character ever says anything in a simple, straightforward manner. Jules could have simply told Yolanda, Be cool and no ones going to get hurt, which is just the type of line youd find in a generic, run-of-the-mill action flick. Instead, he goes off on a tangent about what Fonzie is like. Tarantino savors every word of his characters, finding a potential wisecrack in every statement and infusing the dialogue with clever pop culture references. But the lines arent just witty; they are full of intelligent observations about human behavior. Think of Mias statement to Vincent, Thats when you know youve found somebody special: when you can just shut the f--- up for a minute and comfortably enjoy the silence.What is the movies purpose exactly? Im not sure, but it does deal a lot with the theme of power. Marsellus is the sort of character who looms over the entire film while being invisible most of the time. The whole point of the big date sequence, which happens to be my favorite section of the film, is the power that Marsellus has over his men without even being present. This power is what gets Vincent to act in ways you would not ordinarily expect from a dumb, stoned gangster faced with an attractive woman whose husband has gone away. The power theme also helps explain one of the more controversial aspects of the film, its liberal use of the N-word. In this film, the word isnt just used as an epithet to describe blacks: Jules, for instance, at one point applies the term to Vincent. It has more to do with power than with race. The powerful characters utter the word to express their dominance over weaker characters. Most of these gangsters are not racist in practice. Indeed, they are intermingled racially, and have achieved a level of equality that surpasses the habits of many law-abiding citizens in our society. They resort to racial epithets because its a patter that establishes their separateness from the non-criminal world.Theres a nice moral progression to the stories. We presume that Vincent hesitates to sleep with Mia out of fear rather than loyalty. Later, Butchs act of heroism could be motivated by honor, but were never sure. The film ends, however, with Jules making a clear moral choice. Thus, the movie seems to be exploring whether violent outlaws can act other than for self-preservation.Still, its hard to find much of a larger meaning tying together these eccentric set of stories. None of the stories are really about anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didnt need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind. 
Simply The Best	England	To put this in context, I am 34 years old and I have to say that this is the best film I have seen without doubt and I don't expect it will be beaten as far as I am concerned. Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will. 
One of the best movies of the century!	Warsaw, Poland	 If you think Pulp Fiction is brilliant, you're wrong. It's more than that. It's a milestone in the history of film making. It's already a classic. But why? Because of the many f words, or maybe because of the brain and skull pieces on the rear window of a car? No, that's surely not the point (unfortunately some other users - fortunately the minority - don't get it). Tarantino has made a movie that's someway different from many other action, gangster or crime movies. What's so different? He knows the subject of the movie is cool, he knows it's a product of mass culture, and he even likes it by himself. But he smiles at it and tells three great stories with a lot of irony. And this irony is the first point. The second point is that he gave souls to extremely schematic characters. They surely aren't another action heroes who you forget as fast as you can twinkle. They are human beings like we are, talking about Burger King and McDonalds, about TV series and a foot massage. They just earn their money with killing others or selling drugs. What else is so great about Pulp Fiction? It's the acting, the directing, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the sense of humour and the whole rest. In my opinion it's all worth nothing less than a 10 out of 10. A masterpiece. 
Unbelievable.	Canada	Pulp Fiction may be the single best film ever made, and quite appropriately it is by one of the most creative directors of all time, Quentin Tarantino. This movie is amazing from the beginning definition of pulp to the end credits and boasts one of the best casts ever assembled with the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Christopher Walken. The dialog is surprisingly humorous for this type of film, and I think that's what has made it so successful. Wrongfully denied the many Oscars it was nominated for, Pulp Fiction is by far the best film of the 90s and no Tarantino film has surpassed the quality of this movie (although Kill Bill came close). As far as I'm concerned this is the top film of all-time and definitely deserves a watch if you haven't seen it. 
The Movie that redefined a genre	Halifax, Canada	Viewers are taken on a ride through three different stories that entertwine together around the world of Marcellus Wallace. Quentin Tarantino proves that he is the master of witty dialogue and a fast plot that doesn't allow the viewer a moment of boredom or rest. From the story of two hit-man on a job, to a fixed boxing match to a date between a hit-man and the wife of a mob boss. There was definitely a lot of care into the writing of the script, as everything no matter the order it is in, fits with the story. Many mysteries have been left such as what is inside of the briefcase and why Marcellus Wallace has a band-aid on the back of his neck, which may be connected. The movie redefined the action genre and reinvigorated the careers of both John Travolta and Bruce Willis. This movie is required viewing for any fan of film. 
It's Wild, It's Chaotic, It's Pulp Fiction!!!	United States	 My oh my.  Pulp Fiction is one of those roller-coasters of a movie.  It is both a joy and a trial to sit through.  Amazingly original and unforgettable, Quentin Tarantino's trash masterpiece never gets old or seem outdated.  It put a face on American independent film making in 1994. Miramax had been around since the 1970s and no one had heard of it before this film.  Studios went into a panic when this film came out because they knew it would be an amazing hit.  Of course it was.  Independent film making became the rage and hit its peak in 1996 when four of the five nominated Best Picture films were from independent studios.  The screenplay and direction by Tarantino are quite amazing, but the cast makes the film work. John Travolta (Oscar nominated) re-invented his career with this film. Bruce Willis cemented his celebrity.  Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman (both Oscar nominees) became marketable superstars.  Others who make appearances include: Ving Rhames, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, Steve Buscemi, Frank Whaley, Harvey Keitel, and of course Quentin Tarantino himself.  They all leave lasting impressions as well.  Samuel L. Jackson stood out the most to me, his lack of substantial screen time may have cost him the Oscar.  Just an amazing accomplishment, all involved deserve recognition.  Easily 5 stars out of 5.  
Great director. Great story. Great characters. A masterpiece	Barcelona, Catalunya	 Tarantino is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time and maybe the best of the 90's. His first film, Reservoir Dogs was amazing and claustrophobic, his segment in Four Rooms was by far the greatest (even though Rodriguez's was excellent too)and Jackie Brown is a wonderful homage to the Blaxploitation films of the 70's. However, Pulp Fiction remains my favourite.It was nominated for so many Oscars that I still find it hard to believe that it only got one: Best original script. I'm not complaining because Forrest Gump got best picture, since that film was also Oscar-worthy, but come on, movies like Tarantino's or the Shawshank Redemption deserved much more.Anyway, going back to the movie, I particularly liked the first and second chapters, and that's really a contradiction because one of the movie's finest characters, Mr. Wolf, appears on the third. Bruce Willis also does a great job, and as far as I'm concerned he fell in love with the movie right after having read the script. I like the way his character gives a tough guy image at the beginning and then we discover he's so affectionate and tender to his wife. Travolta is obviously the star of the movie and his second encounter with Bruce Willis in the kitchen along with the scene where he dances with Uma Thurman is when the movie reaches it's highest point.The other star is Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a wise assassin that obviously knows how to handle situations. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger... is my favourite quote.Summarizing, Pulp Fiction is a modern classic and a must-see for anyone who is at least aware of what a movie is. I give it a 9 out of 10.  
One of the Best Films Ive Seen In A LONG Time... and still is	United States	Quentin Tarantinos Pulp Fiction is a terrific film. It also gets better with each viewing, especially if one of those happens to be on a big theatrical screen where all of the BIG compositions get bigger and more detailed. How much else is there to talk about it after all these years? Its filled with dynamite, sudden and always interesting action, great and naturally clever dialogue, and memorable characters. Also, the acting is always something to behold as by turns straightforward, over the top, subtle, and just downright menacing and spot-on. The directing is one of the strongest that weve seen from Tarantino, as he makes his choices in pacing with shots in unconventional ways but never in a way that would be distracting. And writing, already noted, has been copied by many, and only equaled by a select few. The dance sequence. Samuel L. Jacksons superlative monologuing. It has loyalty among low lifes, and many other odd characters that are all bad and not one is a villain or hero. And somehow even after years of parody and terrible rip-offs, it holds its own and- as one can say after seeing it at a midnight screening- holds its audience as much as it had the countless times before they saw it (or if they are, the first time). The first time youre surprised, the second time you look for the clues or other ambiguity, and then the third time you laugh you head off. The fourth time... Ill leave to you. 
Awesome!	None	I just finished screening this movie for the first time after putting it off for a number of years because of what seemed like equivocating appraisals from some of my friends. In hindsight, however, it seems to me that while the movie must have definitely bowled them over, overall they werent sure exactly what to make of it or how to articulate what were probably a confused mix of feelings. But I am so impressed that I feel compelled to add a few specific observations to the many fine reviews already on this database.First, this movie hits you with an impact somewhere in between, say, APOCALYPSE NOW and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, and for some people may be just as disturbing (however, in this respect I am happy to report I didnt think it rose to the level of NATURAL BORN KILLERS). Full of graphically violent action and language, PULP FICTION is not a picture for everyone - I would definitely not recommend it to my parents, born in the 1930s (even to my one fairly hip relative of the same generation who, at age 66, still teaches high school sex education and likes to talk about things like sunbathing nude, among other potentially sensitive issues).Irrespective of audience sensibilities, however, the film-makers, supported by superb acting in every role, manage to create a world full of the most fascinating sleazy characters possibly ever to appear on screen. From Travoltas pronounced almost-child-like curiosity about the world to Jacksons sincere and thoughtful philosophical ruminating and Williss deep devotion to the memory of his father, I think such fascination lies not only in the characters personalities as they are portrayed but in the way they tantalize the viewer into considering the possibility that such people could actually exist. As a lawyer of some years experience dealing with all sorts of people I was particularly drawn to this aspect of the film.Thus, and in response to some other reviewers comments, I think this movie is more character-driven than plot-driven. Instead of a story peopled by basically weakly developed characters employed primarily as a mere device to move the plot along, as is too frequently the case in the movies (especially these days), the undeniably strong, clever, and unpredictable plot lines in PULP FICTION are actually of essentially secondary interest and importance, serving primarily as vehicles to get you worried about the fate of characters you cant help caring about despite the truly low attributes that otherwise form the basis for their respective personas. As at least one other reviewer noted, when the film ends you are actually disappointed, left craving more of these crazy people and their explosive lives.Finally, and as strange as it may sound, this film reminds me of another Monumentally Great Film which one would never typically associate with it in any way in a million years - CASABLANCA. As in that film made way back in 1942, and as another reviewer has suggested, perhaps its special appeal - its unusually high degree of emotional impact - lies in its distinctly successful simultaneous application of several different genres in a single film - drama, action, dark humor - with the whole thing bound together by essentially flawless execution in every department. And while CASABLANCA is no doubt clearly much more wholesome and high-minded, like the older film PULP FICTION is not without a pronounced theme of redemption, even if it is not as strongly felt, considering all the later films sleaze and violence.In sum, when people say that this is probably the best film of the 1990s, it is easy to see why. Fundamentally a truly outstanding movie, it is a must-see for anyone who considers themself a film buff and can handle graphic subject matter.(Incidentally, if you would like a more toned-down, much more overtly humorous and less serious picture with a not-altogether dissimilar look and feel, dont miss another 1990s Travolta picture, GET SHORTY.) 
Tour de Force	Oregon, USA	Thats what this 1994 film is, a tour de force cinematic expression by Quentin Tarantino. A film with which Tarantino staked his claim to the title of genuine Hollywood wunderkind, auteur, young genius, all ala Orson Welles. Pretty heady stuff.By what means? First, with a snappy script with witty if not cerebral give-and-take dialog, written mainly by Tarantino himself. Then, by populating the cast with an intriguing hand-picked array of actors to deliver those well-written snappy lines. This film oozes inspired casting, of actors who either played against type or at least became offbeat and edgy in ways in which we hadnt hitherto known them. Then, through the editing process, by telling the story in a maximum non-linear way, out of time, reducing the film to a series of seeming disjointed non-sequential vignettes, each vignette featuring the aforementioned snappy dialog delivered by the aforementioned hand-picked edgy actors. It is only after watching the entirety of the movie, and reflecting back on it, does the gestalt emerge for the viewer. And, it may take more than one viewing to get there. Then, lastly, by topping it all off with a snazzy soundtrack. Thats how. Add all that stuff together and you get Pulp Fiction.The film received its share of acclaim, and deservedly so. But that said, while seen by most as a good film, Pulp Fiction is not regarded as another Citizen Kane, and Pulp Fiction is not ensconced in the pantheon of the greatest of the great Hollywood films of all time. Those are for a reason. As good a cinematic achievement as Pulp Fiction is, the fact is that as a film it plows turf thats just way too coarse for comfort. Over-the-top blood, guts, and brains-blown-out violence. Gritty gutter language. Subject matter dwelling in the underbelly of life that goes way beyond seedy or unseemly. And its all presented in a very graphic way. Some people really like it that way. Hey, I understand. Thats what Tarantino wanted too, right? But the simple fact is that such fare isnt for everyone. Period. In this way its own intentional and unrelenting coarse nature is what self-selects it out of the greatness category. To achieve greatest of the greats greatness it has to be seen that way across the board, amongst every audience. Pulp Fiction by Tarantinos design isnt intended to appeal to everyone.And whither Tarantino? Thats the real question. His career didnt actually begin with Pulp Fiction, what with the auspicious start he made a couple of years earlier with Reservoir Dogs (1992). And Pulp Fiction of course certainly wasnt his last film. The Kill Bills, Vol. I and Vol. II, 2003 and 2004 respectively, were noteworthy and ambitious projects. And Jackie Brown (1997) made its mark too. But lets be honest here. When it comes to Tarantino it looks more and more like Pulp Fiction is as good as it gets. And he hasnt moved much beyond dwelling on the coarseness in any appreciable way. In fact, hes still earnestly tilling that soil. And getting less and less out of it too, if Grindhouse (2007) is any measure (and most will say it is a measure). Of course at his age he has the potential of many more films in him screaming to get out, but unless he evolves in some new directions, unless he stretches himself in some new and different ways as a storyteller, Pulp Fiction may end up being his magnum opus. Which isnt a terrible thing. Pulp Fiction is a remarkable movie. But, hey, we thought thered be more. 
The fact that aspiring actors, directors, and writers can&#39;t find work while this crap is produced is absolutely appalling.	United States	*Disclaimer: I only watched this movie as a conditional agreement. And I see films for free. I wouldn&#39;t be caught dead giving my hard earned money to these idiots.Well, to explain the depth of this &#39;film&#39;, I could write my shortest review, ever. Don&#39;t see this movie. It is by far the stupidest, lamest, most lazy, and unbelievably UNFUNNY movie I have ever seen. It is a total disaster. But since my hatred for this movie, and the others like it, extends far beyond one viewing, I think I&#39;ll go on for a bit.I don&#39;t know any of the people in the movie besides Carmen Electra, Vanessa Minnillo, and Kim Kardashian, but it doesn&#39;t matter. They&#39;re all horrible, though I think that was the point. The editing is flat out horrible, and possibly blatant continuity errors make this crapfast even crappier than I thought it would be. Now I know that these films are not supposed to be serious at all, but come on, it&#39;s film-making 101 that if someone gets a minor facial cut, it should be there in the next shot. AND, if someone gets cut by a sword, there should be blood and at least a cut (though since the Narnia films &quot;get away with it&quot;, I&#39;ll give Disaster Movie a pass here).The &#39;jokes&#39; are thoughtless and mindless physical gags that obviously take after some of the most popular movies of the last year (there&#39;s some from late 2007 as well, including 2 of our 5 Best Picture nominees).You know what the saddest thing about these stupid movies are? I don&#39;t care how much money they make, or how many cameos they have, these sorry ass excuses for films are taking away jobs from actors, writers, and directors that truly deserve the attention. Lionsgate, I thought you had better taste than this. You should be ashamed of yourselves for making this kind of crap. And as for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer? Burn in hell. You guys are contributing to the decline of western civilization. Correction...you are the CAUSE of the downfall of western civilization. 
Not Humorous...in the least bit	United States	I am writing this in hopes that this gets put over the previous review of this &quot;film&quot;. How anyone can find this slop entertaining is completely beyond me. First of all a spoof film entitled &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;, should indeed be a spoof on disaster films. Now I have seen 1 (yes count them, 1) disaster film being spoofed, that being &quot;Twister&quot;. How does Juno, Iron Man, Batman, The Hulk, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Amy Winehouse, or Hancock register as Disaster films? Selzterwater and Failburg once again have shown that they lack any sort of writing skill and humor. Having unfortunately been tortured with Date Movie and Epic Movie I know exactly what to expect from these two...no plot, no jokes just bad references and cheaply remade scenes from other films. Someone should have informed them that satire is more than just copy and paste from one film to another, though I shouldn&#39;t say that because some of these actually just seem to be taken from trailers.There is nothing clever or witty or remotely smart about the way these two write, and I can&#39;t believe that some people still pay to see these travesties. It&#39;s an insult to the audience, though if they enjoy these films I doubt that they are smart enough to realize that.Rating: Unfortunately there is not a number low enough (yes this includes negatives) to rate this. This deserves to be in the top 5 worst films of all time, right there with Date Movie, Epic Faliure...I mean movie, and Meet the Spartans. I would rather be forced into a 24 hour &quot;Manos: The Hands of Fate&quot; marathon than watch this slop. 
There&#39;s just no point anymore	Canada	Really, I could write a scathing review of this turd sandwich, but instead, I&#39;m just going to be making a few observations and points I&#39;ve deduced.There&#39;s just no point in watching these movies anymore. Does any reader out there remember Scary Movie? Remember how it was original with a few comedic elements to it? There was slapstick, some funny lines, it was a pretty forgettable comedy, but it was worth the price of admission. Well, That was the last time this premise was funny. STOP MAKING THESE MOVIES. PLEASE.I could call for a boycott of these pieces of monkey sh*t, but we all know there&#39;s going to be a line up of pre pubescent annoying little buggers, spouting crappy one liners like, &quot;THIS IS SPARTA!&quot; and, &quot;IM RICK JAMES BITCH&quot; so these movies will continue to make some form of monetary gain, considering the production value of this movie looks like it cost about 10 cents to make.Don&#39;t see this movie. Don&#39;t spend any money on it. Go home, rent Airplane, laugh your ass off, and then silently judge the people that are talking about this movie on Monday. Do yourself a favor. 
The irony is very correct.	Canada	Since the name of the movie is &quot;Disaster Movie&quot;. The basic irony is that it&#39;s a ****ING DISASTER! A 90 minute **** flick based on pop culture and movie trailers. My god, Seltzer, retire and live off the money you made from your other below 3 star rated pieces of horse ****, please. Now when you do these type of movies, you&#39;re never going to get the &quot;jokes&quot; in 5 years, maybe even 2. They&#39;re just wasting their time, not really. They&#39;re just wasting our time. But whoever goes and sees this are brainless (Hypocrite moment) but bare with me, I got in for free and I regret it.A free ticket, and a bad nightmare.Do not watch this, support other films that are coming out today whom deserve it more.Come on, do you REALLY want more of these? **** guys, just ****. 
Awful, pure stupidity	United States	This movie I saw a day early for free and I still feel like I got ripped off. It is totally brain dead. Burping, kicking in the groin and boobs all over the place. Lame. What is wrong with society, that films like this even get made? The parodies were all horrendous, and un-funny. The plot was lackluster at best and the acting was shallow, transparent and really quite unnecessary.Anyone see &quot;Idiocracy&quot;? Remember the movie that won all the academy awards in the future? Well this is that movie. I have not seen a more rancid crappy film. &quot;Date Movie&quot; was okay, The Scary movies at least had decent plots, but this, this makes &quot;spoofs&quot; (if I can be so nice to call it that) for this year 0 for 3, with &quot;Meet the Spartans&quot; and &quot;Superhero Movie&quot; all falling flat.Well I&#39;ve wasted even more of my life typing about this sack of cow dung. So all in all, don&#39;t see this movie, unless of course your IQ is below 80.Thanks, R 
Wait... What?	United States	Honestly, what is wrong with you, Hollywood? Not only is this the WORST thing that has happened to you ---- you keep funding these &quot;cheesy writers of Scary Movie&quot; to make these movies. I mean, come on Carmen Electra, you know even better than them that you have potential! Stop portraying in parody movies! See, I can&#39;t believe I am comparing &quot;parody&quot; to this movie. This movie has no &quot;parody&quot; or &quot;comedy&quot; in it, this is all referencing. All they need to do is see a movie title, take a line and a scene from a trailer, and turn it into a script. Never in my LIFE have I ever been so ticked off by you (Hollywood).I mean, Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, you don&#39;t even care for the money, you just want to prove you can be a film-maker too, but that&#39;s not the point! Movies are something you should enjoy, and this... this is making bland jokes and pointless (as I may say &quot;comedy) with fart jokes and people being hit with objects... or just getting hurt (but you realize that they are okay)?Now please, STOP! You&#39;re ruining the name of &quot;parody&quot; and you are causing people to hate you even more!Please, as a warning, DO NOT WATCH THIS. 
Someone please put an end to Seltzer&#39;s awful career	Cold Spring, KY	I was given a free ticket to this film; so I can&#39;t complain that I was ripped off (except in that some 90 minutes of my life were irretrievably stolen from me). These sort of movies (Date Movie, Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans) haven&#39;t been funny for some time now but &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; has reached a new low. There wasn&#39;t one real laugh anywhere in the film, and most of the alleged &quot;jokes&quot; were actually painful. (There was a considerable amount of childish, mean-spirited stuff in the form of racist, sexist, and especially homophobic, garbage present, along with ample helpings of juvenile gross-outs.) None of the actors were even bothering to put up any pretense of acting. There is nothing hip, clever, or even mildly intelligent going on here. The entire film is from beginning to end crass, vulgar, irrational, and utterly humorless in any human sense. I know that in the past these sort of trash has made enough money to keep Seltzer et al., grinding them out but &quot;Disaster Movie&quot; may just be the downfall of the franchise. The utter contempt that Seltzer and his collaborators have for their audience is finally beginning to show through clearly. If this one fails (and from what I saw in the almost empty theater there is a good chance of it), Seltzer will have to go back to the drawing board, stop making these lazy catastrophes, and finally develop a real sense of humor. This movie is an unfunny piece of puke - stay away from it. 
Disastrous	Upstate New York	OK, so &quot;Disastrous&quot; isn&#39;t an imaginative barb for this movie, but then there&#39;s not a shred of wit to the movie, so....I saw this movie for free. A friend who said he &quot;pissed his pants&quot; at the trailer had free passes. I think he&#39;s incontinent.A spoof of disaster movies might have been fun. This is not it. A couple disaster movies get referenced, not really spoofed. Instead, the &quot;spoofing&quot; is of recent movies of all genres, and of aspects of current pop-culture. Then again, how current is women&#39;s wrestling or the &quot;Head On&quot; commercials?If there&#39;s anything about it that&#39;s good, there&#39;s the 70 minute or so running time (where did they get 90 minutes?) and Nicole Parker seems like she might be good, if she had good material. 
Never EVER make a bet with your friends	United States	If you saw the other previous spoof movies by these two horrible gentlemen, then you should know that this already will be bad. I&#39;ll tell you the truth, if you want to watch it as a brainless person (ironically meant for the stereotypical teenagers, which I am not) then you will laugh at it a bit. But if you judge it, even a little, the movie automatically fails. Why? Never ask that when it comes to these two men.Remember the good old Hollywood days whenever making a movie was about showing people a type of art, and also a story that kept you on the edge of your seat? Well whenever word hit that making films earned you loads of cash, then all these greedy people came in the picture and its quite pathetic. These two are no exception. We still have movie artists (most notably the genius that is Christopher Nolan). But these two guys just...well I&#39;ve been writing so big words, let me put it in simple terms for these guys...These guys suck, they are not artists, but instead money craving whores. And their latest movie proves this even more so.The movie fails so easily its mind blowing. I mean nothing was funny in the trailer, and people usually put the best stuff in them (like idiots sometimes).I knew it was going to be bad, but I made a bet with my &quot;friends&quot; and that wasn&#39;t a good idea at all. I have to write movie reviews in a paper and tell everyone whats good and whats bad, same for my friends. We flipped on who has to review it...Why me? Well I&#39;m warning you at least. It shouldn&#39;t even be called a movie, nothing about it is artistic or original. The jokes..I&#39;m sorry, the references are made throughout at pretty much random, like the Hannah Montana or the Juno gig (they were actually close to spoofing it, but failed by referencing instead of joking and twisting it).Oh and please, the random wrestling scene? I don&#39;t know about you other guys, but I have high respect for women, and I have a high respect for film-making. What I do know is you shouldn&#39;t have something in a movie that doesn&#39;t add up to the story or anything. Nudity is not really needed (Titanic was the closest exception, but still you would&#39;ve gotten the idea if you only saw her bare legs.) Now I hate it when a girl says all guys are the same, perverts and brainless (and if you disagree with what I said about the nudity in a film, you might be one of them unless you actually believe it has a point), and sadly this film just makes that stereotype a little bigger. Thats if anyone watches it, which hahahaha!!! By the way, when I said movies should have scenes and only scenes that add up to the main plot, that was the ticket right there to say that this movie fails. Yup, just like that. Perhaps I&#39;m grading too hard for these guys. I mean its a brainless movie...Nope, they deserve it. Besides thats the best part about reviewing a bad movie, you get to rip it inside out. Thats if you know how to grade a movie correctly.But lastly (well I&#39;ve got about 4 scores worth of bad movies I need to write about, but whatever) the main idea about spoofing was brand new when Airplane! came out. Same with Naked Gun. And whenever something random came into play, the story was still progressing. For example, the arrow in Airplane! shooting out of nowhere: random, yes, but the story was still movie and no one was distracted except the audience. Perfect. Naked Gun, not only was it spoofing cop films and others, but it also had its own jokes. Same with Airplane! Anyways this movie was made for money, not to tell people a story. Simple as that, and never flip a dang coin to determine something that could be life threatening.I give it a 1 out of a 10. Just do yourself a favor and watch good movies, or mediocre for that matter. 
My Eyes!!!!	United States	It&#39;s hard to imagine anyone writing a &#39;spoof&#39; movie even worse than Meet the Spartans, but Seltzer and Friedberg have pulled it off. It&#39;s not even just a little worse. It makes Spartans look like Raiders of the Lost Ark in comparison. You will seriously feel ill afterwards and more than likely have a strong urge to gouge your eyes out.May Contain Spoilers....if you care: First off, as it appeared in the trailer, this movie does not spoof, or really even reference disaster movies at all. The set shakes a few times, there are some plastic asteroids, and a bad cgi tornado, all of which that do nothing to add anything to the movie, but other than this there&#39;s nothing even relating this to said style of film. Instead we get references (not to be confused with actual spoofs) to such films as High School Musical, Step Up, this summer&#39;s crop of comic based films, Enchanted, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Kung Fu Panda, and Sex and the City. I can&#39;t wait to hear Seltzer and Friedberg praise their own genius and describe this movie as being modeled around Cloverfield...they clearly tried to do this, but other than the outline of the small group of people running through the city trying to find the injured girlfriend, there&#39;s nothing relating this piece of crap to the monster movie.I can honestly say I did not laugh once at this movie. All of the &quot;jokes&quot; were forced, and many of them were dragged on for several minutes at a time...the two writers clearly thinking they were onto some kind of comedy gold here. Probably the most insulting thing about this movie is, like all their other gems: Epic, Date, Spartans, they consider the audience to be mentally challenged...having to tell us point blank what movie it is they are referencing (again...not spoofing) Such lines like: &quot;It&#39;s an inconvenient truth, it&#39;s global warming,&quot; &quot;Come here you kung fu panda,&quot; &quot;what is this enchanted place,&quot; &quot;How do you know all this? I know because I saw Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,&quot; &quot;Let me get my Get Smart phone (proceeds to talk on his shoe),&quot; and &quot;whats with the marching band? I thought I&#39;d cheer you up with a high school musical&quot; all exist to make sure we&#39;re in on their super intelligent antics.Please, save your money for anything else. Show Hollywood that they need to stop these two guys from making any more movies. I can&#39;t even imagine a 5 year old finding this stuff funny. Speaking of 5 years old, that&#39;s about how long many of these jokes will last before absolutely no one can find them funny anymore since, as usual, most of them are simply based on pop culture references. 
An interminable, shoddily-researched lecture masquerading as comedy	Lincoln, NE	For those of us who have watched Kirk Cameron pontificate on the wonders of the banana, or read his musings on the legitimacy of the existence of fire-breathing dragons, we know that Kirk Cameron himself is comedy gold. One might expect more hilarity from Cameron in Saving Christmas, but Cameron actually intentionally tries to build a comedy here, and the result is an unfunny, unfocused, interminable mess.The film begins with an uncomfortable scene involving Kirk Cameron sitting in a chair, lecturing at the audience. &#x22;They don&#x27;t want us to love Christmas,&#x22; Cameron declares authoritatively, never bothering to define exactly who &#x22;they&#x22; are. Cameron drones on for several more minutes, and at this point in the film, I heard a kid in the back of the theater yawn loudly&#x97;perhaps an audible protest that this film would not be the exciting romp promised on the poster.Finally, the film cuts away from Kirk Cameron, and we see several characters enjoying a Christmas party. But then we see Kirk Cameron again, the film freezes, and we hear Kirk Cameron narrating about himself: &#x22;That&#x27;s me&#x97;Kirk!&#x22; More lecturing ensues.Eventually, a character by the name of Christian (almost as clever as &#x22;Josh Wheaton&#x22;), a Christian himself, despondently finds his way to a car, apparently disillusioned by the materialism of Christmas. Enter Kirk Cameron, who enters the vehicle and does what he does best&#x97;more lecturing.The majority of the film takes place in this car as Kirk lectures to Christian, with occasional cutaways to Biblical imagery. Cameron tries to make the case that Christmas traditions, such as celebratory trees and gifts, all somehow originated with Christianity, not paganism. (Never mind the fact that ancient paganism predates Christianity.) &#x22;Last time I checked, God created the winter solstice!&#x22; is the type of asinine reasoning you&#x27;ll hear from Kirk Cameron throughout the film. Cameron&#x27;s facts are both dubious and sparse, and his connections are spurious&#x97;but Christian is nevertheless invariably blown away by Kirk Cameron&#x27;s apparently amazing insight.Perhaps aware that interminable lecturing on its own would be unbearable for an audience, the film provides characters with quirky personalities in an effort to break up the tedium. In particular, we are treated to a scene back in the house of two characters rambling schizophrenically as they drink hot chocolate. It has nothing to do with Christian&#x27;s story, it makes the movie feel unfocused, it goes on for far too long, and if my theater is any indication, it is not funny at all. In fact, there was dead silence in my theater throughout the entire run of this &#x22;comedy&#x22; film.The film ends with a dance sequence that feels like it lasts ten minutes, as well as multiple, gratuitous blooper scenes&#x97;I suppose for no reason other than to pad the running time. Just when you think it&#x27;s finally over, we see Kirk Cameron again, and he continues to lecture the audience&#x97;this time about how materialism is just fine, because Jesus came to us in a material body, after all.One gets the impression that Kirk Cameron actually started reading his own Bible, was disturbed by what he found (such as Jesus&#x27; instruction to &#x22;go sell your possessions and give to the poor&#x22;), and produced this film as a desperate justification for his own hypocrisy.At my theater, nobody laughed, and nobody stayed for the end credits. This purported comedy film fails at every level. If you&#x27;re really looking for a laugh, go back and take a look at what Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort have to say about the glorious design of the banana. 
A yuletide atrocity	United States	It&#x27;s no secret that, on both the mainstream and independent circuit of film, Christian cinema has been a big focus in 2014. Films like &#x22;Heaven is for Real,&#x22; &#x22;Noah,&#x22; &#x22;Son of God,&#x22; and next month&#x27;s &#x22;Exodus: Gods and Kings&#x22; have all catered to the faithful in some way and have gone on to achieve uniformly strong financial numbers as well. The independent circuit has seen big hits like &#x22;God&#x27;s Not Dead&#x22; and marginal successes like &#x22;Left Behind,&#x22; &#x22;Mom&#x27;s Night Out,&#x22; &#x22;Persecuted,&#x22; and &#x22;When the Game Stands Tall,&#x22; all of which finding ways to connect with their target audience in at least recognizing their faith in the cinema, a place where it&#x27;s fair to believe the religious demographic has felt ignored. Former Television star and devout, outspoken Christian Kirk Cameron has now thrown his hat in the ring, latching on to this newfound trend, and effectively making not only the worst film of its genre but the worst film of 2014. &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas&#x22; is a disjointed mess, structurally pathetic and morally bankrupt as we watch scenes interwoven with little coherency, dialog written and delivered in its most wooden form, and wonderful morals to teach our children, like &#x22;materialism is good.&#x22; The film begins with Cameron sitting in a blatantly artificial living room, decorated with more Christmas lights and flair than Macy&#x27;s after Thanksgiving passes, giving us an introduction to the film at hand. He states the biggest problem with the Christmas season is the &#x22;people&#x22; who want to segregate the spread of faith and good cheer to the private homes of those who celebrate the holiday or simply want the holiday done away with all together. He rambles on for about three minutes as the introduction sets the perfect theme for this film; it&#x27;s a circumventing project that never results in a specific or thoughtfully-articulated point.We cut to a Christmas party held by Cameron&#x27;s sister, where a Santa has been hired, the tree has been erected, the house has been decorated, a feast has been prepared, and everyone is in an incorruptibly cheery mood; everyone except Cameron&#x27;s brother-in-law Christian (director Darren Doane), who is seen moping around the house before quietly slipping away to his car. Kirk follows Christian and learns the materialism of Christmas bothers him immensely, as he watches kids beg for toys they won&#x27;t play with in three weeks and parents max out their credit cards, giving way to the materials and the illuminating tree in the center of the room, and all while neglecting the baby Jesus in the manger, who is the ultimate &#x22;reason for the season.&#x22;Cameron begins to initiate flashbacks to biblical times to &#x22;justify&#x22; why we have the Christmas traditions that we do. However, it&#x27;s not enough that we get a history lesson told from the enormously biased lens of Cameron, but in a dodgy and muddled manner. Cameron gets absorbed in the significance of baby Jesus&#x27;s swaddling cloth and the original mean-spirited roots of Saint Nicholas (something that will undoubtedly scare and confuse children), never addressing Christian&#x27;s true distaste for the holiday season. Kirk meanders for about forty minutes, talking himself in incoherent and redundant circles, never addressing Christian&#x27;s questions in a way that we can extract counterpoints or citing Christmas&#x27;s Pagan and cultist roots (if you&#x27;re going to show Saint Nicholas as a brute, at least address the backstory).Interjected in these ridiculously dry biblical flashbacks and in-car dialogs are exaggerated characters masquerading as likable people with personalities drawn so wide they are desperately unfunny. We see two party guests discuss &#x22;The War on Christmas,&#x22; relating it to several other conspiracy theories that just feels like a soundoff of paranoia. We get a few minutes of dead-end, annoying conversation and some of the worst displays of acting this year before it&#x27;s back to the car for a half-assed lecture. &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; ends with an abhorrent dance number to an incorrigible techno/rap hybrid, with members of the cast obnoxiously dancing and doing slow-motion choreography together. We end things with a perfunctory voice-over with Cameron before we&#x27;re greeted by almost ten minutes of closing credits showing bloopers, outtakes, and a barrage of other things padding this project to just barely being feature- length (eighty minutes). If my plot synopsis sounds like it has not made any sense, then I have effectively lived up to the structure and the narrative pace of this particular film.Just by comparing the full-length film to its trailer, you can tell &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; was Cameron&#x27;s last minute idea to cash in on the Christian cinema craze of the year. The trailer for the film talks about how Christmas has been corrupted by materialism and the political correctness of the holiday. However, Cameron blatantly contradicts his thesis when he states during the closing monologue that &#x22;materialism is good&#x22; because Christmas is about &#x22;God taking possession of a material body.&#x22; Aside from ushering in a pathetic excuse for a moral at the end of a film about Christmas, the cardinal sins committed here run amuck: a sloppy narrative hodgepodge of biblical flashbacks, inept lecturing, and pointless filler clearly padding a small runtime, atrocious acting on all fronts, a desperate attempt at &#x22;staying hip&#x22; and keeping the attention of the audience by throwing in a hip-hop dance number, contemptible morals, and failure to address or even stick to a cogent thesis. Kirk Cameron and company should be required to volunteer at local charities or help cater several breakfasts with Santa to make up for such a yuletide atrocity. 
Kirk Camerons Low Budget Soapbox	United States	I created this account just to give this 1 star. That&#x27;s how bad it was. I went into this expecting a generic Christmas movie, and I didn&#x27;t even get that. The &#x22;plot&#x22; is awful. I put plot in quotation marks because I&#x27;m not even sure if this movie has one. Two guys walk out to a car and talk for an hour. That&#x27;s all that happens. It&#x27;s basically a feature length sermon, and a crappy one at that. There are literally NO redeeming qualities in this film. The camera work is extremely amateurish, and the acting and direction were absolutely abysmal. I had extremely low expectations for this, and it still managed to be disappointing. This movie is a total waste of time and money, and I honestly believe it&#x27;s the worst movie of 2014. 
A horrifying cash grab	Australia	This movie is horrendous on so many levels - patronising to Christians, incredibly bad plot and direction, the acting and dialogue is as comfortable as a dentist&#x27;s visit. I suspect the whole thing is purely a desperate attempt by Cameron to pander to under-educated Christians in an effort to earn their hard earned dollars. Either that, or it is just a giant ego trip for him. I had no preconceptions before I went to watch this, and left confused as to the amount of utter garbage wedged into what seemed like an eternity of boredom. Even worse, he is asking his Christian supporters to bear false witness by skewing the votes here and on rotten tomatoes. Hypocritical? I&#x27;ll let you decide. 
This movie is why a 0 star rating should be implemented on this site	None	Saving Christmas needed saving...and by that, I mean it should have been mercy killed. the acting is horrendous and it&#x27;s story is only a reminder that anyone that paid to see it wasted their money. Even if you are a die-hard Christian, please do not see this movie, it&#x27;s one of the worst movies you could ever watch ever, and considering stuff like The Room and Birdemic exists, That&#x27;s saying A lot. oh, and that thing Kirk Cameron&#x27;s doing to try to boost the rating on Rotten Tomatoes: Cameron, you should know the Bible verse &#x22;Thou shalt not bear false witness&#x22; it&#x27;s one of the 10 commandments. That&#x27;s all I have to say on this matter, Don&#x27;t watch the film. I mean Seriously Cameron, you should know better. 
Not remotely funny, neither in the right nor wrong sense	Germany	I have to admit, that I hadn&#x27;t even planed to go to the movies on the day that I walked into &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22;. There was nothing on offer that interested me, so I turned to figure another way to squander my money. But then I saw the name &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x22;, saw that pasty face on the poster and two words came to my mind: &#x22;Crockoduck&#x22; and &#x22;Banana&#x22;! Yes, through the internet-memes and jokes I had been exposed to Cameron and his ilk. Upon realizing that those people were not comedians, I figured this was the most hilarious insane stuff I had heard in a long time and that Kirk Cameron may well be the missing brother of &#x22;Dumb and Dumber&#x22;. So I flashed the buck, walked in and expected much unintentional hilarity and future memes in the making.There were about 10 to 15 people sitting in the cinema, most with kids (I presume they were expecting a Christmas comedy). For a good deal of the beginning we are exposed to Cameron brattling on about some things or other, but it was mainly boring, nonsensical stuff that contained no (unintentional) comedy gold. Only when Kirk spouts that &#x22;god created winter solstice&#x22;, there was some chuckling to be heard. Not bad, but heard before (what hasn&#x27;t god created allegedly? Cars, air, shoes, bacteria, the universe and everything else, etc &#x96; this answer will give you a guaranteed A+ in any bible- or koran-school). At this point Cameron is sitting in some car with another guy and, like a true believer he keeps rambling and rambling and rambling. Nodded off for awhile but since I have a light sleep and get easily awoken by noise, I can only deduct that there was no joke missed since nobody had been laughing so far. At what I presume must have been the end of the &#x22;movie&#x22; there was some ridiculous dance-sequence (you know the type that should signify to the audience that they&#x27;re watching a &#x27;hip&#x27; film) and I decided to call it a day. As I turned to leave, I noticed that the cinema was empty and that I was the last rat to leave the sinking ship. So I left Kirk and his friends to dance to an empty cinema &#x96; and for all I know, they still dance there as I write.Look, we are all aware that people will believe much if only it gives them a crutch for reality. Virgins giving birth, horses flying from Mekka to Jerusalem overnight, zombies rising from the grave in order to bring world-peace, etc. It would be pointless (and perhaps even unkind) to point out that virgins cannot give birth, horses don&#x27;t fly and that the dead stay dead. But that&#x27;s were magic and science clash, alchemy has to make way or chemistry and believe hollers at common-sense and knowledge. Nothing new there, it&#x27;s been going on since the stone-age. But the stuff that Cameron and his ilk have formulated here (to put it kindly), that&#x27;s a whole new dimension of crazy. It reeks not only of fanatics but of self-serving. And the worst sin: this movie is boring, tedious and free of laughs, no matter which way you slice it.The lesson learned: it can be mildly amusing to watch a five minute YouTube video about a deranged guy, but giving him 80 minutes of your live, that&#x27;s simply not a good idea. It&#x27;s like holding a &#x27;deep&#x27; conversation with a bunch of jehova&#x27;s witness or the guy on the corner with the &#x22;the end is nigh&#x22;-sign &#x96; what&#x27;s the point if no real laughs are to be had? Just wait for the internet-meme; if there&#x27;s something worth laughing about, the &#x22;haters&#x22; will find and post if for sure (and it&#x27;s free!). &#x22;Jesus Camp&#x22; was funnier (and &#x22;Jesus Camp&#x22; was actually a very sad movie). This here is &#x22;IMDB Bottom-100&#x22;-material.Now, enough electronic ink wasted on this. Let&#x27;s make space for those who found the movie &#x22;exceptional&#x22;, &#x22;inspirational&#x22; and &#x22;great education&#x22; &#x96; you might be able to guess from which corner those come.What I give this tripe? Of course nothing. If you see a one point rating, it probably comes from god (pardon, meant to say IMDb) 
Kirk Cameron isnt saving Christmas hes desecrating it	None	What&#x27;s wrong with this movie? There&#x27;s not enough time or space to cover all of it, so I&#x27;ll just share the main reasons why anyone who loves Jesus, His Word and His people should or would never watch this mockery of Christmas.&#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; is in direct violation of Romans 14:5-6 and 22-23, twists Scripture, reconstructs history and encourages gluttony.There&#x27;s nothing in this film that is &#x22;wholesome&#x22; and good for anyone, believer or non-believer.Let&#x27;s save others from Kirk and crew&#x27;s version of Christ&#x27;s first coming and celebrate (if your conscience allows) with reverence, awestruck wonder and with the true and great joy that envelopes all who are humbled by and grateful for God&#x27;s most amazing Gift--Jesus Christ, the one and only Son of God.http://www.sunnyshell.org/2014/10/kirk-camerons-saving-christmas.html 
Notice how long the 10-star raters have been members, and how many movies theyve reviewed...	Pittsburgh, PA	First, let me state that in spite of the claims of Cameron and those who support him (and who have attempted to artificially raise this movie&#x27;s ratings with fake profiles and fake reviews), I, as someone who hated this movie, have nothing against Christians or Christianity. Not at all. Most everyone I know and love _are_ Christians. Die-hard, conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Fox-news-loving fundamentalist Christians. And even THEY thought this movie sucked.That Kirk tried to use religious guilt on people to have the ratings artificially inflated is just pathetic. Seriously, dude, you have a problem. You need help. Get some. :-/ My opinion of this movie is pretty much the same as the opinions of EVERYONE I know who&#x27;s actually had the misfortune of deciding to give it a try. It would be pure camp if those who made it weren&#x27;t being so stone-faced serious. It&#x27;s patronizing, condescending, childish and just downright _bad_. And it&#x27;s not the message, itself - even those I know who agree with the central point Kirk&#x27;s trying to make see the movie as doing more harm than good.As for that illicit ratings-inflating campaign, it appears to be bearing fruit. When you have a movie with overwhelmingly bad ratings (and I man REALLY bad, where most are just 1-star with, shall we say, &#x22;Nothing nice to say...&#x22;), and just a couple of profiles with 10-star ratings and glowing things to say, and ALL of those 10-star profiles were clearly just set up just to make the glowing review about just that one movie... I&#x27;m not going to outright accuse anyone of anything, but, well, it doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in their legitimacy.I mean seriously, dude, stop it. You&#x27;re not helping Christianity&#x27;s image at all. In fact, you&#x27;re making it worse. Even if you don&#x27;t care about your own image, you should seriously give thought to how much more damage you want to do to the Christian image in the U.S. today. Or are you a closet atheist trying to destroy the &#x22;enemy&#x22; from within? Your actions are hurting far more than helping.And I have nothing against Christianity or religion in general. If people want to be proud of their religion and remind themselves of the spin Christianity has added to the meaning of all these previously-existing traditions and holidays, that&#x27;s wonderful. But this? This isn&#x27;t _that_. This is just pandering, patronizing, exploiting - pure and simple.Please, Kirk, get help. 
How to Watch Saving Christmas	New York City	Every so often, a movie comes along that reminds us why drinking games were invented. This is that movie.Three margaritas seems to be the minimum for watching this one. With that much tequila in you, you will be able to appreciate the subtle humor and profound wisdom of Kirk Camer...hmph....hmph....hmph....BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. I thought I could type that with a straight face. I couldn&#x27;t. Must be the margaritas.At any rate, this is a laughably bad movie that should go a long way toward torpedoing Mr. Cameron&#x27;s already sinking career. And I say, fire at will! 
Not feature-length quality	United States	Full disclosure: I am a Roman Catholic, raised by devout parents and taught by dedicated clergy. I happen to subscribe to the view that the &#x22;war on Christmas&#x22; is part of a larger, not necessarily connected, movement whose chief side effect is to eliminate or diminish the chief underpinnings and foundations of western Judeo-Christian society. Lawsuits against Nativity displays are, to me, the handiwork of unhappy zealots. Having said all that, this film was earnest but profoundly flawed.First, I didn&#x27;t appreciate the swipe against the Catholic Church&#x27;s hierarchy (bishops with high hats and scepters) during the St. Nicholas segment. I do like the St. Nicholas story, but it was contrived here with the original St. Nicholas doing a &#x22;ho-ho-ho&#x22; (I am not kidding) just before being told by his assistant to start the deliveries (presumably of gifts).Second, if indeed the simplicity of the original Nativity is to be stressed, with Jesus born to Mary and Joseph in a cave, laid in a feeding manger, then perhaps they should have cast a Mary who had not just had her nails done. There they were, as Mary was holding the Christ child, each nail impeccable - and painted. And their garments? Perfectly clean, even looking like they&#x27;d just been ironed. Third, don&#x27;t direct so that we can see the direction. Head turns, puzzled looks, earnest looks . . . I shouldn&#x27;t be hearing in my head the director&#x27;s exact stage directions. &#x22;OK, look right at him then turn away.&#x22; Fourth, this was not about Saving Christmas. This was about explaining our modern celebration of it - it&#x27;s already been saved, judging from the frequent references to it being celebrated the world over. I liked Noah. I liked Narnia. I like the Hobbit movies. I did not like this one.
