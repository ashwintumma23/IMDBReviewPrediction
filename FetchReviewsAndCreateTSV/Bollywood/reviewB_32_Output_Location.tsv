Wow this American loves this movie	None	I asked my co-workers to recommend a Bollywood movie. I expected Dumb and Dumber by the title. It wasnt that at all. It is more of an inspirational comedy with some serious but good messages. A more accurate title would have been The Legend of Rancho.Odd to me is that they speak in part English, part Hindi through the movie, kinda like some speak Spanglish here I suppose. I know none of the actors but the acting was good, and there was plenty of humor. The characters were believable. Most movie dancing I find a little silly but I even liked the dancing routines in the bathroom.I will be asking my co-workers for more recommendations after this one! 
Aal izz very, very, very, very, very Well	India	Whatever the problem in life is... just say to yourself Aal Izz Well.. This wont solve your problems but it will give the courage to face it.. Chase Excellence and success will follow..  Life is not about getting marks, grades but chasing your dreams.. These are the golden rules which 3 IDIOTS teaches you in a very light and entertaining way.. The movie makes you laugh and in the process you learn many golden rules which can alter your life in a big manner...3 actors from the path-breaking blockbuster RANG DE BASANTI( Aamir, Sharman, Madhvan) team up together with Rajkumar Hirani.. It couldnt get bigger! Loosely based on blockbuster novel  Five Point Someone  by Chetan Bhagat the movie deals with the present education system in India that whether getting more marks and better grades is better than gaining knowledge and is mugging up everything more useful than understanding it..The movie has many hilarious scenes and everyone in the film form Aamir to Boman Irani to Omi Vaidya were superb in their roles.. Aamir has outdone himself.. Never in the film he has looked 44 year old... Films music sounds mediocre but when viewed on the screen then the music sounds perfect.. Cinematography is awesome and so is the direction.. Raju Hiranis screenplay(you can easily ignore a few loose points) is a masterpiece and the film will achieve cult status for engineering students in a short period of time.. It has the soul which Five Point Someone had.. It is easily Aamir Khans finest film to date.. The films climax is fantabulous and is a shocker.. It takes everyone by surprise...To conclude 3 IDIOTS has the potential to break all records and sweep all awards.. Watch it... You will Love it...My Rating: 9/10Thanks and Regards 
This Christmas  New Year, go gift yourselves - watch this phenomena (Not for Professors) !	IIT Roorkee, India	Im an IITian myself and hence, needless to say, was looking forward to this movie as it is based on the life in IITs. I went with my family and watched the first-day-first-show and was I pleased ? In one sentence - The best Bollywood movie ever ! If you are into movies, then this one is not to be missed unless you are the 4th idiot. I cried, I laughed and I enjoyed every moment of the 3 hours that I spent watching this gem. The songs that seemed mediocre before watching the movie, feel like perfect for the movie. They are so ideal for the situations that I just loved them.As you can understand, they could not bring the name of any IIT into the movie to avoid disputes. But trust me, whatever they have shown about the life in IITs, its all true. Right from suicides, cold-hearted Professors to lack of encouragement and support for talents who can really bring serious change in this world. The movie successfully depicts how once inside, your life is only about meaningless grades, go get into the race before its too late.Take my free advice and avoid any reviews or words from people who have already seen the movie. Dont let anyone spoil any scene from the movie. Rush to the nearest theater and experience the phenomenon for yourself. Youll bless me for this advice ! 
Aamir has yet again chased excellence  success follows him !	United Arab Emirates	Plot Two idiots Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman) sets outs on a journey to find their lost friend and the 3rd idiot Rancho (Aamir).. As the journey starts off, their college life and old memories of their friendship, with a unique free-thinker Rancho who inspired them and changed their lives, are unfolded through flashbacks and followed with some twists and turns...My Views 3 Idiots looks at our educational system which pressurizes the students and does not allow to chose his destination by his own wish, in a satirical way and brings out some of the flaws in it... On parallel there is a love angle between Rancho and Pia (Kareena)... Many of the situations/characters have resemblance or inspiration to Five Point Someone, blockbuster novel penned by Chetan Bhagat...Both humour and emotional quotients are amalgamated in the right proportion, full credits to Raju for that... Film offers lots of quality rib-tickling moments throughout.. The intermission point offers a twist that is totally out of the blue and keeps you hooked to the movie ! Just when you think this feel-good comic caper is leading to its culmination, there is another surprising element at the climax which is brilliantly weaved out by Hirani...Technically, it rocks with astounding and visually arresting cinematography, the aerial shots of Shimla and Ladakh are a pleasant treat for our eyes... Editing was good... Song visualizations were cool... Music was good and well placed with the flow of the narration...Coming to performances, all of them comes out with convincing portrayals, but it is Aamir Khan, the real showman of Bollywood, steals the shows with yet another stellar portrayal and will go down as one of his best performances. His looks and mannerisms as a college student was genuine and consummate.. Madhavan and Sharman adds up with commendable performances... Kareena does her part well... Among the supporting, Boman Irani as the eccentric head of the institution was too good...On the downside, there are some unbelievable filmy situations which can be excused as writers liberty and the episode of Monas delivery was a bit far stretched.. Still these minor negatives does not affect this wholesome entertainer ! In short the basic theme of the movie is that chase excellence and success will follow.. Just like that Aamir and Raju has chased excellence and success is following them...So to sum up, Aamir and Hirani has delivered the best movie of 2009... Do yourself a favour by seeing this highly emotional and feel good comic entertainer...Verdict : THE BEST of 2009 ! Rating : 9/10for more reviews of the latest Indian movies, visit www.snehasallapam.com 
Wonderfully entertaining.	Bradenton, Florida	Its hard for me to review this film, as I have not seen a huge number of Indian films--probably no more than a couple dozen. Most of the ones Ive seen were wonderfully entertaining but I am far from an expert on Bollywood. Because of this, I have a hard time knowing how good this film is relative to other films from this country. So, consider this when you read this review. This may be among the very best India has to offer or it just seems that way to me.Like so many Indian films, this is a very, very long film--with a run-time of almost three hours. When a movie is bad or just okay, this can seem like forever, but since 3 Idiots is a very, very good film I loved its length. And, like most films of the genre, it has its share of the usual singing and dancing so foreign to films from other countries. One thing you should know, however, is that defining the type of film it is isnt really easy. Much of it is a comedy, but it also has many poignant moments (keep the Kleenex nearby), some existential moments where they explore the meaning of life and work and its also a tender film about friendship. And, as my daughter pointed out when she saw the film, she loved that the men in the movie are not afraid to cry--something you rarely see in western films.As for the plot, its very long and involved and I could recount what occurs. But I dont want to spoil a single wonderful moment, so my advice is just sit back and watch--and if you give it a chance, I can almost guarantee youll have a great time with this poignant and funny film. Wonderful and well worth your time--with a delightful script, wonderful characters and lots of moments that made me smile...and a few that brought me to tears. See this film. 
easily the best Indian movie in 2009.... and one of the best ever	None	I was lucky to see the first day show of 3 idiots on Thursday in Dubai. Well the title of this post says it all. The movie is an example of classic film making. brilliant and highly entertaining.Watch 3 idiots for a) amir khans incredible acting b) intelligent and highly energatic screenplay  direction (Rajkumar Hirani has done it yet again!) c) amazing chemistry among actors, d) some of the best comedy scenes coming from Indian cinema in a long time and e) a heart warming story which keeps you spell binded right till the end.I would rate it as among the best from amir khan (which obviously means among the very best from bollywood. I would also give a lot of credit to the director rajkumar hirani, who after this movie (and his previous munna bhai series) should rank as among the top in bollywood too. 9/10. 
Best Movie of 2009! Aamir Khan reigns Supreme!!	India	We saw a sneak preview of 3 Idiots last night at Globus Cinema in Bandra, Mumbai.Brilliant. Simply, brilliant.Simple but articulate story telling laced with lots of humour and lessons from life. A wonderful experience to watch as every single actor from Sharman, Madhavan, Boman, Kareena  Aamir deliver probably the best performance in a movie this year.Sharman  Madhavan start off on a journey to seek out their friend Rancho. Together they were the 3 Idiots in college. And they take us the viewers with them on this beautiful journey with such warmth, panache, humour and love, that we dont want the journey to end.Sharman really shows why hes one actor to watch out for. His acting genes come through in every single scene. Hes perfect in his role. Sharman, you rock!Madhavan as the guy whos chasing his fathers dreams rather than his own is wonderful. The character who learns to laugh at life and its ironies thanks to his friend Rancho. Madhavan shows his humorous side brilliantly savoring every scene and making it a pleasure to watch. His narration of the movie is very good.Boman Irani is probably the one actor we take most for granted just because hes so brilliant! His characterization of the control-crazy, hyper-active, hyper-competitive, almost dictator-ish, college principal, is beyond words. He plays it so so well, that you love to hate him. Hes that Good.Kareena comes through in this movie as one of the finest actresses we have. No one else could have played her part and also looked so beautiful at the same time.And now take it from a hard core Amitabh Bachchan fan, Aamir Khan is the best actor in town today after AB. Period.His range is phenomenal and his characterization of Rancho in this movie is positively brilliant. The small mannerisms, the walk, the smile, the attitude, the brilliance of a young person whos not restricted by the educational system, his positive attitude towards every thing in life, its Rancho you are looking at. Not Aamir. Aamirs ability to transform himself convincingly from the super-huge well-built temporary amnesia patient on a revenge spree in Ghajini to this whacked out college student, which is half the age he played in last movie shows his prowess as a master actor to transcend age barriers to play almost every role in the book.This is THE best movie of 2009. Aamir again reigns supreme. Thank you Raju Hirani  Vidhu Vinod Chopra.Clich word, but I have to use it - FANTASTIC !! 10/10 P.S. Dont forget to say Aal Izz Well 
One of the best movie of decade	India	Aamir does it again. what a movie .from start to the end, hilarious moments.screenplay is fantastic. full on comedy and yet it never looses its heart. Aamir pulls off a 22 year old character with brilliance. never for once you feel you are watching aamir .It was rancho on screen. sharman n madhavan - i bow down to them. music looks OK on cd but during movie it worked as a plus point. situational tracks works in the favour of film. runtime may sound a bit too much but believe me, you wont know when the first half is over. second half may seem a bit too hilarious but apart from that its a masterpiece. gr8 aamir ,another brilliant movie.10/10 
3 idiots is a masterpiece and easily one of the greatest Bollywood movies of all time	India	I saw the paid premiere of 3 idiots today.On the whole, 3 idiots is a winner all the way everythingwise.3 idiots suits the term landmark cinema and has all it takes to help Bollywood take a giant step into world cinema with pride.3 idiots is a sparkling example of qualitative cinema.3 idiots not only entertains, it also enlightens.3 idiots is forward-thinking, but also makes you recall your roots. It promises lots of laughs and also a heartwarming message.There are movies aplenty, but very few remain etched in your memory and possess recall value. 3 idiots is one of those films. Indisputably and undeniably, this Aamir-Madhavan-Sharman outing is worth the price of the ticket and more.The film will set new records and has the merits to emerge one of the biggest hits of all times. The weekend business should be historic, the Week 1 business should be unparalleled, the lifetime gross should be amongst the biggest of all times. In short, 3 idiots has Blockbuster written all over it.The story of 3 idiots has been told differently and most importantly, the story offers so many twists-n-turns that you just cant guess what would unfold next.Theres so much happening in every scene and the screenplay is so gripping that you dont feel the need to look at the auditorium ceiling or at your watch at brief intervals. You arent restless. 3 idiots demonstrates how strong film-making can enhance and elevate an already solid concept.An Aamir Khan film is nothing short of an event. The supremely talented actor acts in one film a year and no two films are ever identical in terms of plot line.To sum up, 3 idiots is commercial Hindi cinema at its best. The film has Hit written all over it. Let me put it this way: Cancel whatever youre doing today and go watch 3 idiots instead.Director Rajkumar Hirani strikes a fine balance between humor and emotions. The comic portions are executed with panache, the drama is attention-grabbing and the emotional quotient is strong enough to turn you moist-eyed. The marriage of humor and emotions as also technique and content is what drives 3 idiots to the winning post. 
Dont BE A STUPID BE AN I.D.I.O.T. !   must watch.	India	Yesterday i watched 3 I.D.I.O.TS(I Do it On My terms)the most entertaining and simply the best movie of this decade after RDB. a movie with a message(chase excellence success will follow)without loosing its sense of humor,a movie about friendship and love,a movie about flawed education system, a movie about unhealthy competition.this movie is team work ,every one does its part very well. Aamir (what a actor he is!!!)is excellent as Rancho ,Madhavan and Sharman are perfectly in sync(watch both of them in drunk scene), Kareena is OK,Boman played directors character as good as it was possible,Omi was top notch (watch Chamatkar \Balatkar scene),But whenever the team wins credit goes to captain,and here the captain is Rajkumar hirani.He gave Jaadu Ki Jhappi in MB,Gandhigiri in LRMB and now he says ALL IZZ WELL and believe me he is 100% right.Dialogues: Witty with humor and to the point, Chamatkar \Balatkar scene is one of the best comic scenes . Music: Shantanu Moitras music also have a role in the movie,all the songs come alive on the screen,(watch Zoobie-Doobie and Aal Izz Well)FINAL WORDS: its like a marriage between RDB and Lage Raho Munnabhai. no doubt there is some MASALA but we indians like it . Rating: FIVE POINT SOMETHING OUT OF FIVE.Dont BE A STUPID BE AN I.D.I.O.T. ! must watch. 
^_^The best film reflecting Asias education ever!	China	As many ordinary Chinese high school students,who have to study fourteen(14) hours every day for the college entrance examination in the final year,I was entirely shaken and moved by 3 idiots,sharing the same feeling with all the students from high schools and universities in China(or Asia). O(&#x2229;_&#x2229;)O Compared with mainland China,India is lucky,having less corruption in education system.This film is incredible inspiring,especially for those who are struggling or survived in high schools and colleges.I read some reviewer,some doubt whether suicide in the film is logical,which is really DISAPPOINTING! (__!)If you experience the life in poverty areas in Asia,you will understand what a significant role the higher educations play in their lives. Burdening great pressure from family and society,they attach great expectation and significance to the enrollment of colleges,and they intend to abandon poverty by getting higher education.Diploma means everything for them. Thus,the plot where the man committed suicide after lost the chance to graduate is reasonable. 
Very good movie!	Mexico	This is the very first time i write a review, mostly because Im very lazy.However I just watched this film and i gotta admit it...I loved it!!!!At first i was like well lets see what this movie has to offer(btw its also the first Indian movie Ive ever seen) and I was like okayits funny and then... like wow so thoughtful and reflexive! It reallymade me meditate about my career and my real dreams! Its a very goodmovie! Ill recommend it to all my friends!You must watch it!All is Well! 
Scarcely has a comedy provided its audience with so much insight, intelligence, and human affection	United States	All is well, the three idiot heroes of 3 Idiots recite when they become frazzled or nervous, while frantically tapping their hearts. They know that reciting the oversimplifying phrase will not provide their problems with a solution, or even a catalyst, but it gives them the onset courage they desperately need at a time of uncertainty and despair. One character even tries to use the line after an amateurishly-given birth may have gone terribly wrong. Its times like that when the saying may not be so effective, even if its goal is not to provide certain relief.But all is well, as they so often say. Rajkumar Hiranis 3 Idiots, my introduction to the world of Bollywood cinema, is a comedy-drama unlike any one Ive ever seen, long, but never drawn out, frantic, but never desperate, and emotional, but never manipulating. It provides us with three of the most likable characters of the last decade, and with insight to the culture of Indians and their parents. Rarely has a comedy had this big of a brain in its head and a canvas of opportunities in mind, while possessing a title not even fit for a farce.Our title characters are ambitious but stunted Farhan Qureshi (R. Madhavan), jittery, fearful Raju Rastogi (Sharman Joshi), and borderline prodigy Ranchhoddas Rancho Shamaldas Chhanchad (Aamir Khan), three close friends who attend the Imperial College of Engineering (ICE), one of Indias most prestigious colleges where only the best are accepted. The young boys already are facing some of lifes greatest challenges, all of them pursuing the field of engineering when the only one who seems to have a passion for the material is Rancho. Farhan was forced to become skilled in the field because of his strict father, and Raju is pursuing the field with the goal of getting his family out of poverty, with his fathers expensive health bills, his mothers fragile core, and his sisters inability to marry all on the table. Rancho is studying because he feels that one should pursue passion and make a career out of it, so it doesnt feel like work. If youre passionate and devoted to your work, success will find you - yet this is only one of the countless morals and insights 3 Idiots provide its viewer with.The film chronicles their issues in college in flashback, with instances in the presence popping up to show Farhan and Raju searching for their pal Rancho, who has disappeared and avoided contact for several years now. This is not your typical flashback film, however. It uses this method much to its advantage, and doesnt feel like a narrative within a narrative. It seals both stories nicely, but it takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotions through carefully constructed events before it even arrives at those endings.One of their problems in college is the professor/dean of the campus, Viru Sahastrabuddhe (Boman Irani), who the three derogatorily call Virus when his back is turned. Virus is strict and often largely unsympathetic to the problems of his students, which allows the film to explore a dark topic one assumes a comedy wouldnt dare cross paths with and that is the issue of Indian teen suicide. One kid had his father have a stroke, rendering him unable to focus on academics for months, falling gravely behind. Virus is grossly unsympathetic to his case, denying him an extension on a project hes work so unrealistically hard on but can not perfect.If anything, we can say 3 Idiots is a message to the parents of the Indian youth and that is to stop applying pressure to an already stressed out demographic. Ive read several articles articulating the point that Indian teenagers are among one of the highest in suicide rates, and that many parents put an unrealistic amount of pressure, duty, and responsibility on the child to the point of a physical and mental collapse. Youre given the unalienable freedom to raise your kids with the method you choose, but not every method is perfect, and when your method is one of the ones that leads to suicide, mental health problems, and perpetuates fear and anxiety in the minds of teenagers, then you may want to reevaluate your methods.3 Idiots also provides us with the idea that many Indian children are told what to become in life early and are discouraged from exploration or even personal ambition. This I cant believe. What an unhappy, uninspiring, completely wasted life to slog through everyday doing something you loathe all because it was the lucky career choice of your parents. Yet Im sure millions have been lead through this same life. Its the worst way of living through a person that I can imagine.The film runs ten minutes shy of three hours, which for few viewers may seem too long and uncomfortable. I was skeptical myself walking in rather blind. Almost every Bollywood film Ive conducted research on seems to run an upwards of three hours, some extending and testing the waters to roughly five hours. If other Bollywood works have characters drawn along the same lines of being relatable, human, and easily accessible and not biased towards race or social class, I cant see it being a struggle to get through any of the industrys films.Through every quick-witted song and dance number, through every comedic scene, through every instance of dramatic despair, emotionally alive moment, solemnly poignant sequence, suspenseful setup, to a lovely, heartfelt conclusion, 3 Idiots is a wonderful, invaluable endeavor in the world of film. Its actors are beautifully fitting for their roles, assisted by a script so human and true to life that it is honestly hard to believe, and captured through beautifully alive cinematography to collectively give us a beautiful package not just in the figurative sense. This is arguably one of the best comedies Ive ever seen. 
A Must Watch!	India	Rajkumar Hirani... the name is enough to create an excitement in any cinema-fan alive. Munnabhai series have been awesome films, and his latest offering 3 Idiots is another Masterstroke from this genius.I have no idea how 5-point-someone is, all I know is that 3 Idiots is an amazing/awesome/inspiring film. A treat of a film! A film that is rich in emotions, A Film that leaves behind a great moral. The Youth are sure to worship this Film, and that will make this film a blockbuster. Cancel anything youre planning to do till the 31st, watch 3 Idiots, its worth your time and money. Hirani and Joshis script is simply superb. Through Humor how many rights and wrongs are said. I really loved the way Hirani showed us Sharmans family. A typical 1950s family, its hilarious as well as genius. The film has Superb Performances: Aamir is fantastic as Funsok Wang Do. Hes a delight every time he appears on screen and delivers his careers finest work. Maddy excels, hes astounding in the sequence when he shares his heart with his father. Sharman Joshi is good, yet again. Omi is a Masterstroke. A surprise packet, his speech sequence is sure to be remembered forever! Kareena is weak. Boman Irani is mind-blowing as the vicious head. He leaves you speechless in the scene when he awards Aamir The Pen. Mona is average.The Music is decent, with All Izz Well being a complete chart-buster. The cinematography is perfect. All other departments are satisfactory.Watch this film right now... 
more than just a laugh...taught me great life lessons as well	Philippines	Im from the Philippines. For years, I have always been curious about Indian cinema. Ive seen clips of Indian films on cable TV and to be honest...I just dont get it. I dont get all the silly dancing and singing in almost all movies. I find it so corny and irrelevant to the story. But dont get me wrong, Philippine movies back in the 80s were also filled with corny singing and dancing. But we have gone past those and transitioned into movie-making based on good scripts...rather than cheesy story lines. When a friend of mine recommended this movie, I havent really heard of it. I thought it was a Hollywood release but it wasnt. It was a Bollywood movie. He said it was really funny, so out of curiosity, I got hold of a copy. My first thought was that it was nothing but a silly story of 3 guys doing slapstick comedy that I have all seen before. When they started singing All iz well.. I told myself... I knew it! Just what I thought.But as the movie progressed...I was amazed at the intelligence embedded in this movie. I was so impressed with the smart dialogues delivered by Amir Khan. It was so mature and thought-provoking. The life crisis all of them were in... the pressures at school..the pressures from society and the pressures from family as well... they rang so true. I was even at one time crying my heart out. I cant believe it! All the preconceived notions about a Bollywood movie were obliterated. I was so moved by this picture and I have no regrets seeing it. 
The best Indian movie ever	Egypt	To be brief, THIS IS THE BEST Indian MOVIE EVER CREATED..... I know it is old but I just heard about it recently so I watched it yesterday. I think this movie should be one of the best 250 films in history on IMDb rating. I rated it 10/10 and believe me it worth more than this. I dont want to make spoilers in my review so that you will enjoy every minute of the movie. This movie is 2:44 hours length full of laughter, joy, tears, drama and passion. And of course, the most interesting part of the movie is GENIALITY. I loved every moment of this movie. and I hope to watch a lot of future Indian movies like this. Im also waiting for Ferrari Ki sawari movie to watch. It is starred by one of the 3 idiots. Thank you India for giving us this brilliant movie. 
A wise person may look like an idiot: Chinese proverb	Hong Kong	I missed it during the 2010 Hong Kong International Film Festival and am really glad it is released publicly.Havent seen such a feel good movie for a long time. Excellent and inspiring plot with very positive messages and many hilarious scenes.Inspiring messages and witty lines are dotted throughout the movie, intertwined with some teary scenes: all is well if you follow your passion; chase excellence and success will follow; be brave and follow your dream; think outside the box and be flexible.It challenges our current values on education and success  that we should learn for the sake of learning but not for grades or what others want us to do. Whats the point if you memorize everything but do not understand what it means and do not know how to put what you have learned into application? What an inspiring movie. It challenges your comfort thinking mode and urge you to be yourself and chase your dream/passion.Excellent acting, colorful and typical Bollywood musical scenes with uplifting songs and dance moves, not to mention the soothing natural scenery interspersed in the moving episodes of friendship, love, family and playful/stressful campus life.Every student, teacher, and parent or anyone who cares about our future should see it. What kind of world do we want to live in? What kind of person do we want our next generation to be? What kind of lives do we want to lead? This movie makes us ponder on these.Somehow the movie echoed Steve Jobs quotes : Your time is limited, so dont waste it living someone elses life. Dont be trapped by dogmawhich is living with the results of other peoples thinking. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. Both Steve and the Rancho character (Aamir Khan) are smart and creative, nice and helpful to friends and people who are willing to learn. They are true to their feelings. They dare to challenge authority and encourages others to do the same. We need more people like these in this world.Just go see it. You wont regret it. 
Amazing!!!!	United States	If i could give this movie higher then a 10. I would. I think anyone gives this movie a low marking, should not be allowed to judge movies, maybe even keep them out of the theaters!!! This movie is funny, charming, loving, did i mention funny? Will make u tear from laughing as well as in other moments. One second youll be laughing, and the next second youll feel their pains. Lots of ups and downs. awesome movie........must watch for everyone.Amir khan has always been great. Old classic movies to all the new ones. He has broadened his horizon. Amazing actor who plays serious parts as well as goofy roles. He kind of reminded me of Johnny Depp. Man is brilliant. The Dean of the school was also hilarious. I know that had to be a hard role to play, but wow did he pull it off.Again, must watch for young, old, teens. If you have been through college, it will definitely hit the spot a little more.. Enjoy! 
inspiration	Greece	this movie has a lot of things to tell us ..it shows us the extremely huge power of the mind and when the people are free,use their minds correctly and do what they really love as a job in their lives and not what the other people say to them,only then they success,and most of all they are happy and they can live every time of their lives..a movie with so much fun and suspense,with so great direction gives a so inspired result,and everyone will be full of emotions and optimism..i really thought that bollywood was some kind of parody,but without so much fun,without good direction and a lot of things like these..i am really sorry for that but i couldnt know..i thought that they were extemporaneous...fortunately,that movie made me wrong..it showed me that the films from east have so much fantasy and inspiration that i could never imagine..you have to see it!! 
The most fun I have ever had watching a movie!	United States, CT	3 idiots offers a great deal of fun. Indeed, one of the best movies I have ever seen! Its experience is simple, yet its great in every aspect! I absolutely loved the fact that this film had it all, wonderful atmosphere, brilliant acting, lovely inspiring songs and a surprisingly thrilling story! During the movie, I laughed and cried A LOT!! The combination of the movie aspects was astonishing. I never thought I would enjoy an Indian movie as much as I enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire, but this one simply surpasses every other Indian movie. The story is touching, inspiring and funny.. at the same time!! This movie is plain FUN. Its about family, friendship and a little bit of romance. It had a great deal of great family moments that are still stuck in my mind till now (I saw the movie a week ago!) Plus it deals with friendship and its impacts on a persons life, and what a brilliant friendship story we saw in this movie! One of the greatest friendship stories captured on cinema mixed joyously with top-notch fun. I recommend this movie to anyone who actually wants to enjoy a real movie experience that has it all, in other words.. this movie is recommended for EVERYONE! Acting: 10, Direction: 9, Soundtrack: 10, Story: 10, Overall rating: A decent 10!Dont just rent it, OWN it and show it to friends who like to enjoy a fun movie! 
amazing movies	Australia	I absolutely LOVED this movie. I was one of two or three white people in the Cinema, and waiting in the line i got a lot of looks, but Im speechless to how good this movie was!!! Aamir just keeps getting better!!!! TZP was amazing, Ghajani was amazing and now 3 Idiots... AMAZING!!! cant wait to own it on DVD!!! I might even go see it again at the cinema!! Ive now seen about 5 Bollywood movies at the cinema, and i own about 30 movies on DVD. Im an Aussie what LOVES Bollywood  Aamir Khan!!! What movies is next for Aamir? Im sure it will be another to touch our hearts, id love to see his body ripped like in Ghajani again! 3 IDIOTS ROCKS!!! 
I Laughed! I Cried! And Im giving this a 10!	United States	When I was looking through IMDbs Top 250 movie list and saw a movie called 3 Idiots, I was surprised. Why would a movie with such a bad title be voted so highly? I went in thinking this would be Indias version of Animal House or American Pie. But after watching the film, I was in love! It is so much more than the usual college story of young guys getting drunk, flunking classes, and getting back at their superiors. It is an extremely well-made film about doing what you love and facing your fears. The acting is incredible by the ensemble cast. The script is funny and poignant at the same time. Even the scenery is breathtaking. Although the length of the film is pretty long and has some quirky musical numbers, 3 Idiots is a delight. It is worth the watch! 
Absolutely loved it.	United States	I checked this out on a whim from my library and was so impressed that I just had to come here to review it. Please note I am NOT Indian, but this is (as of yesterday) one of my top five favorite films of all time. My only criticism is the title - its horribly misleading for American audiences who would probably expect a Judd Apatow nonsense film (and offensive to boot). Not so with this film - the characters are anything but idiots despite their college experiences. Brilliantly written and directed, theres something for everyone here: comedy, tragedy, and even a couple of song and dance numbers (seamlessly integrated). The acting is superb, the plot is a bit complex but fascinating, and its shot with care and attention. LOVE IT. 
The only movie that made me laugh and cry so hard...	China	As you can see, Im a huge movie buff. However, my scope is strictly limited to English-speaking movies. In other words, I have scruples watching foreign movies in subtitles. Nevertheless, Im completely in the state of idleness for the whole summer. Whats even worse, Ive run out of American movies to watch since Ive basically watched every movie that suits my palate. A friend of mine hugely recommended this Indian movie for me to watch. I was completely reluctant in the beginning to say the least. The title sounds like a Jim-Carrey-parody-like comedy which nothing in it can be literally taken serious. On account of my preference for serious movies, I tend to ignore those silly comedies. However, my friends non-stop imploring drove me nuts. To humor him, I decided to give the movie a try.The beginning was kinda within my expectation. Two goofy idiots started to turn the world around them upside down by extremely over-the- top actions(stopping a flight, hitchhiking a limousine), they reached an observatory of The Imperial College of Engineering, aka ICE, their alma mater, to meet a friend theyve lost contact for six years. Only to find another classmate, Chatur, who started to boast himself for his success over some guy named Rancho. Until then, I was feeling this movie was no different than any other comedies. However, the following sequences kicked in and I was completely blown away. It all started with a magnificent melody that unveiled the main storyline.The main character, Rancho, was a guy who was enrolled in ICE. However, he was totally different than any other students. Instead of studying by rote like any other students, he focused more on the practical aspect of the knowledge. As a result, he was able to shock a bully in the groin with electricity. There was another student like him, who was working on his own helicopter project. However, their director, Virus(a nickname of course) wouldnt allow him to graduate. The heartbreaking rejection ultimately led to the students suicide. Rancho realized the education system in India was extremely flawed. It suppressed the personalities of all the students, focusing on nothing but the grades. Rancho decided to step up against it. He kept challenging his teachers and even the director. He made 2 good friends, Farhan and Raju(the two goofy idiots in the beginning) and really inspired them. Later, he met a girl named Pia, who turned out to be the directors daughter. A lot of clashes occurred in Ranchos intent to change the education system and even his friendship was put to test. The ending of the movie was so touching that anybody would shed tears from their eyes, with a small twist that would made everything pleasant once again.Overall, its really a sweet movie. It can be a comedy at times, with a lot of over-the-top action from Rancho and his friends. However, its a lot more than that. Its more of an insight into the education system of India, which is similar to those in the likes of other Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea. It can at times be so heart- warming that your tears cant help but surge out like waterfalls. It can be a musical too, with a lot of exotic dances and songs which are common among Indian movies. Great film. Totally change my impression for Indian movies. Easily 10/10. 
One of the best movies that make you laugh and cry and think at the same time	Zhejiang, China	This is the first Bollywood movie I have seen. (I dont know if Slum dog millionaire is also an Indian movie or not.) I have learned from my parents long ago that Indian movies are excellent and full of dance scenes. They watched quite a few Indian movies when they were youngsters.Then I had my first experience of watching a Bollywood movie quiet by accident. It was during the sports meet held by the school in which I teach English. I was appointed to do some work using the computer, which we would run some movies when we were free. And the first movie was 3 Idiots. I dont know who picked the movie. To be honest, I never would have picked this one myself because of its stupid Chinese title, which, translated back into English, is 3 idiots who make scenes in Bollywood. I expected to see a movie that was funny from beginning to end and that could be enjoyed without your brain working too hard. It turned out to be way more than that. Its a movie that made me laugh uncontrollably at some points, shed tears at other points and think all the time.Its about friendship, dream, love and college education. I think the best part is about college education. The situation depicted in the film is almost the same as in China. As a teacher in a high school in China, I know exactly what problems we have in education. What shows in the movie is exactly what happens in China right now. We attach so much importance to grades that teachers and parents will do anything to improve their study, which causes a lot of students losing interest in study. I recommend all Chinese educators see this movie. I myself have watched it for at least 6 times, including those times I watched it in my class with my students.I give it a ten.

Didnt like the name	Colombia	I loved this movie, it was a very smart and enjoyable movie despite the length. I loved the characters specially Rancho, Pro Virus and Silencer. I am not a fan of music in movies but I loved the music in this movie. The only thing I didnt like about the movie was the name: 3 idiots is not appropriate, it should have been Looking for Rancho or Al-its-wel. Another thing was It doesnt explain much about why Rancho ran away from his friends and his love, it never explains why he couldnt express his love. You can sort of figure it out at the end of the movie, but is not that clear. Well despite all this it shows Hollywood that a movie can be funny and smart at the same time, and a college movie doesnt have to be about stupid humor, booze, bombshells and boobies. 
idiots...a lot of idiots	India	I am writing this very late, even though I saw the movie on the first dayit took a second fast-forward viewing on my laptop to compel me to opine on this film. And since brushing through the comments, I found a lot of good stuff written about it, Id like to skip over the brownie points the film certainly deserves and focus on what I found sodisappointing.1) sigh, the jokeswhat to say, I actually felt embarrassed listening to them and hear people guffaw on stuff that evoked chuckles in the 70s. 2) over the top scenes which were just not required- Rancho taking a bath in the garden(!) in front of everyone? In most good institutes even walking on the grass is frowned uponn here this chap doesnt mind spoiling the soil with his soapy water. (This is what annoys me about characters portrayed as non-conformists. They confuse it with plain indecency and ludicrousness, like when Patch Adams bared his bottom after getting his degree); n driving the scooter into the hospital itselfwhy couldnt he just stop at the doorway n make it a genuinely good shot??? 3) The timeline was all wrong; did no one do math at primary school? Farhan says they hadnt seen rancho for 5 yrsramalingam returns after 10 yrs to keep the betno one saw rancho after college finishedengineering is 4 yrsthe bet could not have been made before the second semester as they already have had at least one semester exams!!! Simple math will tell you its all goofed up. Kareena kapoor was engaged when these guys were in 1st-2nd yearso she waited 8 years to get married??? If that banker guy was so considerate and patient, he is the real hero 4) Anybody who has lived in hostel with room mates will tell you that in 4 yrs together, you get to know every minute detail about you buddies; these guys didnt even know ranchos hometown! 5) And these supposedly bright engineers and the doctor Kareena dont have even enough brains to look up the college records to find Ranchos address? They could have at least asked Boman Irani, who would have certainly known it considering he knew Chachads monthly income! 6) Even with that lame, copied joke Do you know who I am, they are just ridiculing their own film; is it so difficult for a professor to find three students of a class whose faces he has seen from the college records? A cheeky antic like that would have meant instant suspension in a real IIT. 7) Hiranis idea of ragging is based on the fairy tales boys brag to wide-eyed fifth-graders; you just cant survive in a hostel if you electrocute a seniors winkie on you first day. Id have loved it had they shown Rancho getting a beating from seniors in return for his actionsit would have truly highlighted the ragging problem. Instead they showed the whole bunch of seniors running scared on seeing a baby-faced fresher with a live wire. 8) And oh, they took the peeing joke too far, too many timesits disgusting. Ramalingam, a VP of some MNC peeing on a school building? Come on 9) I understand that the ridiculous arrangement barred Rancho from keeping in touch with any student from ICSbut what about Kareena? Was his love so shallow he didnt give a damn about her just to honor some crazy vow which didnt even involve her? How are they showing Indian women? She has no self-respect? She runs away from her wedding, betraying a guy who waited 10 years for her to a guy who left her in a heartbeat? And is it unnatural or materialistic to scream if someone spoils your 2 lac wedding dress or loses a 3 lac watch??? Again the problem with execution of an idea; there were a thousand better ways to expose that guys shallownessbut all what rancho and his pals did was irritate him by damaging his property. 10) And the law breaking, which when done with timing looks good was just taken too fargetting an international flight stopped, fooling a taxi driver whod probably lose his job, leaking university paper- they are criminal offenses-why do you need to portray new age thinking with a disdain for the law? 11) And finally even if we forget the fact that any decent college has a medical attendant, a health centre and generators always present to accord a movie a spicy climax, hirani spoilt it with the all-is-well clich. Cant just one thing be normal? 
A really fun and enlightening movie	Malaysia	Ive decided to start this review by describing what happened during the screening of this movie in one of my University class to demonstrate just how interesting this movie really is.Our lecturer has decided to replace one of our classes on a weeknight and during the class, he has decided to show us this movie. The class started at 8 p.m. and as my class consist of students who are used to skipping classes (even the afternoon ones) or are prone to leaving early (including myself), I was expecting the class to be almost empty by the end of it.By the end of the class, which was about 11.30 p.m., none of the students actually left the lecture hall because everyone really enjoy the movie so much and all of us wanted to finish the movie because it was fun, interesting and inspiring.The movie has tackled an important aspect in the modern society: Why do we study ? Is it only for the sake of getting a well-paid job in the future ? Or was it for the knowledge or interest ? This movie had us questioning our purpose of studying and whether we are doing it for the sake of our future job, to fulfill our parents demands and expectation or to feed our hunger for knowledge ?All of us go to school for a different reason, some to make friends or to hang out with their friends, there are some who really enjoys learning new things everyday but many are those who go to school just for the sake of completing their studies.The movie tries to bring out this point through humor, loads of them ! The movie is really funny and through unfolding the events by looking into the past and present, it avoids being too straight forward which in my opinion, keeps the audience interested in the movie without getting bored.I really love the movie and has always recommended people to watch it, in fact, everyone that I know who have watched the movie loved it. This movie is really one of my favorite movies of all time. 
Dont judge this book by its cover!	South Dakota	This movie hit on all cylinders. It was fun, funny, deep, intelligent, thought provoking, and seriously entertaining. It is not a dumb comedy, rather a very smart (and humorous) look at the struggles of engineering students in India.I thought I would have trouble with the subtitles, but after about 10- minutes I was completely 100% engrossed in the movie. The wife loved every bit of it.My single and only criticism is the length of the movie. I believe there were one or two too many situations which kind of caused the movie to drag.Otherwise I thoroughly loved it.Do not be fooled by the idiotic picture on the cover of this movie. And the first 5-minutes of the movie are not indicative of the brilliance of the rest of the film. It is not stupid humor (even though I like stupid humor).You will leave this movie being glad you watched it. Trust me. 
An oeuvre dart	Brazil	For starters, every cinephile must watch this movie, its absolutely mandatory!!!! The movie has great story line, rich in its roots, evolves naturally, showing beautiful landscapes of India. All characters are so dense, so real, so credible, despite of being caricatured....there is a lot of marvelous interactions between them all way down the story...and their interaction onto scenarios are great and constant...thats one thing I could notice it made the movie such a strong production.... The film is funny, genius, superb, surprising, fading from touching moments to challenging scenes, so naturally...... Reamrkable photography as well. Its one of the most exciting movies Ive ever seen - is deep, enjoyable and, ultimately, leaves a lesson about what is really important in life.... I recommend the family watch this movies, together...is outrageous!!! It mention taboos, the everydays strive of families, hopes, dreams, disappointing, love, envy, debauch, etc.... And all this magic moment, start with an aborted airplane take-off...... 
Americans, Enough, This movie is that good!!!!!!!	China	Well, at least it is in Asians Mind. Its SO GODDAMN GOOD for Asians.You dont get the high school thing so you think its overrated. Well, Dark Knight and The Avengers are overrated for us because we dont get the superheroes thing. But so what? Still, a lot of people love it, so Stop Taking Your Personal feelings as The Lethal Truth. To make you understand better. Let me tell you something about the high school thing. If you have studied in Chinese or Indian High school you will understand whats all about the suicide and sad plot. Life was like a pis of sh!t. You have to wake up at 6:30 and go to bed after like 10:30, you can never choose your class, you can never say anything that against the teacher, you can never be in relationship with boys or girls. Right here, NO PARTY, NO PROM, NO NOTHING. All you have to do and all you can do is study and study, and the only way to make your life better is to get good grades. Because of the hard works and lack of fun, youre totally exhausted while the teachers and parents keep complains that youre lazy. And whats even funnier, is that 80% of what you have struggled to learn has nothing to do with your future life. So it simply sucks here.Thats why we love the film, it showed our mind, its not a perfect movie. But it make us laugh and cry. This movie is 9.1 in douban.com(A Really Famous Website in China)Its 8 out of 10 for us, and even for some of you. For some of you, its 6 or 7 out of 10. So, its 8.1 for average. NOTHING IS WRONG. So, please, try to understand. 
Great Entertainer / but Story and Character holes	United States	3 Idiots is way too short a movie, which is simply another way of saying that it is an extremely entertaining movie! Raju Hirani has served an hat trick. Three great movies in a row. Raju has brought his Gandhigiri to the world of education, this time the Gandhian is Rancho.Acting is great by Boman Irani, Sharman Joshi and the best Omi Vaidya or Chatur, without whom 3 idiots would not have been what it is.Its almost impossible to find any significant deviations to excellence when you have a team like this one. Raju, Boman, Aamir, the perfectionist to name a few.But there were a couple of things under the surface that disturbed me a little bit.To start with the easy one, When you anger your senior in the first 5 minutes of entering the college, you know for sure it cannot end there. So from that point of view, the ragging scene mysteriously ends prematurely. Another one is, Boman Iirani or Virus knows Ranchos dads monthly income but not his address? They spend 10 years searching for him, why didnt they check the college register?Now for some serious ones.I like Aamir Khan movies because you never ever ever see Aamir, you only see the character he is playing, which is exactly how it should be. Unlike Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan movies where you see the movie stars instead of their characters (exceptions apply of course, for example in Chak de India you couldnt find Shah Rukh even if you wanted to). In 3 idiots, I got to see Aamir Khan more than a couple of times and I was surprised. That got me thinking, why would our perfectionist entertainer allow for something like this.The plot thickens and the mystery deepens. Hmmmm. So I dug deeper and eventually hit the gold mine. Its not Aamir, its his character Rancho which has a fundamental flaw that even Aamir could not overcome. Rancho is projected as someone who loves to learn, he wants to take in every ounce of knowledge he can absorb for any source possible. But his actions are that of a revolutionary, from teaching the director on how to teach to mocking the definitions of machines and books. On one side he is a sponge, an introvert on the other hand he is a rebel, and extrovert. These opposites needed reconciliation in the story.Somewhere along the way, even meanness crept in. I am referring to Chaturs switched speech. Now dont get me wrong, I enjoyed every bit of that scene. But that does not mean that it flowed with Ranchos character. I think the writers mixed up Aamirs earlier characters, Aakash from Dil Chahta Hai would do this in a heartbeat, DJ from Rang de Basanti would probably go one step beyond, but not Rancho and definitely not for a demo. Rancho is pure, or at least thats what Raju is portraying him. The same goes with the climax. Now, even though, all of us cheered when Chatur got shafted towards the end in a strange twist of fate. Some how I had a hard time believing that filing 400 patents and signing with the Japanese gel well with this Gandhian educator.Aamir, in his interview, mentioned his approach to looking young in the movie. His pacings, mannerisms, style of dialogue delivery etc. He executes brilliantly on them.Madhavan is decent. He could have been much better.Omi Vaidya, or Chatur, is the real find of this movie. Hope to see more from him.One additional aspect which is not easily apparent is that this is one of the few movies that projects intelligence with the coolness it deserves, and not in the traditional Hollywood style of nerd portrayal. This is a better role model for students. Towards that end it is on par with Matrix.To make it clear, this movie is vastly more entertaining than most of the movies of 2009. But I am not comparing this movie with other movies, that would be like comparing apples with windows. I am comparing this to other Aamir and Raju Herani movies. And in that comparison, this does not shine as bright.______________________Now, heres what I would have changed if I was in control.* Raggers are caught by the director and are convinced without any pressure not to rag any more * Reconcile Ranchos characters fundamental flaw, requires serious deep dive * Motivation for Chaturs speech prank redone, maybe not even instigated by Rancho * Some better reason why nobody can find Rancho * Redo the Javed Jaffery scene where he talks to his dead father, turning the tables to show that Javed actually wanted to take his father to Disney Land but his father kept on insisting that they wait for the highway contract to go thru. That would be hilarious. * Sharman Joshis family is so central to him but are missing 10 years later, in the starting scene, some how bring them in. Maybe his wife is on the phone talking to his sister, happily married in Bombay, when she yells No Pants.This review was originally posted on my blog: http://roundhayreview.blogspot.com/2010/01/3-idiots.html 
Feel Good	United States	On Christmas day my family and I went to watch a new Bollywood movie called 3 Idiots. Starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor. The majority of the film is a flash back of the college days of three young boys, whose future had been decided at birth. Correlating with with the Indian stereotype of: whenever a boy is born he will become an engineer. The moral of the film is that when one finds what they truly love to do, work will become play. This moral is presented to the audience through numerous comedic and emotional situations very well placed throughout the story line. Although much of the story is very predictable, I believe the film was supposed to be this way, as the point of the film was to teach the audience a very important lesson: do what you love to do. As with all Indian films, this one also had the token love part, which no Indian movie seems to be able to function without. This is a recommended watch, whether it is in theaters or on DVD, this movie is a definite feel good film that the whole family will enjoy. It will also be released in its entirety on YouTube after 12 weeks. 
The Fun Side of Bollywood	United States	There was an article published by Time magazine some years ago. It explained that while China enjoys a robust population and a rigorous educational system (for those who can afford it), the spontaneous and creative aspects of Chinese culture has been subverted. Its been marginalized so much so that American business specialists have been asked to speak at some of chinas most prestigious companies to teach creativity. The article presumes that Chinese middle-managers have had so many concepts and facts drilled into them in school that they are unable to think outside of the box like Americans.Subtle racism and cold war paranoia aside, the article does have a point when it comes to the importance of academic memorization versus creativity. American public schools have been drawing and redrawing that line trying to find the right balance to mold the leaders of tomorrow with mixed results. Yet when I hear stories of a fifteen year old inventing a new groundbreaking cancer test, I cant help but feel a little prideful of being the partial product of American schooling.But while the Chinese seem to be stumbling, India has really stepped up, or at least the film 3 Idiots (2009) would have you believe it. Starring Aamir Khan as the amiable Rancho, the plot of 3 Idiots sounds like a Van Wilder (2002) rip-off. The brilliant but unorthodox Rancho causes mayhem and silliness at an uptight engineering university. His two friends Farhan (Madhavan) and Raju (Sharman Joshi) join in the revelry to the dismay of the pig-headed dean known to the students as Virus (Boman Irani). But when Rancho takes interest in the deans daughter played by Kareena Kapoor, the dean vows to have the 3 idiots expelled for good.Bollywood films are very good at taking seemingly trivial plots like the aforesaid and escalating them into gorgeous, high energy, thematically complex tales for which 3 Idiots is no exception. The movie encompasses a vastness of emotion and a breadth of themes which I do not dare expand on here for fear of ruining the movie. I will say that 3 Idiots does further validate my hypothesis that a major theme in modern Bollywood is upward mobility. While my familiarity with Indian film is limited, all the films I have seen made over the past twenty years involve a protagonist unhappy with his or her station in life and works their butt off to achieve better, often through creative means.I saw this theme in the repellently named Wedding Planners aka Band Baaja Baaraat (2010) and the silly sci-fi comedy Joker (2012). Even the sappy love musicals of Yash Chopra like Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995) have characters who want to do better largely by questioning the conventions of traditional ways. 3 Idiots is an extension of that proud tradition only done with excellent comedy and some surprisingly depth along with some catchy musical numbers.Stop to consider todays modern American films in comparison. Sure there are classic hero journeys in movie theaters but few have unadulterated happy endings quite like Bollywood. Many settle for the moral of do what you can, or you can be happy with your lot in life so long as you have someone to love. And lets not forget the common contemporary comedy message have fun and worry about the consequences later. These messages make since in the economic malaise of the day and the superhero genre has replaced the musical comedy as far as being a glitzy distraction for the masses. Still the superhero films as well as the Oscar-bait of the last few years dont have the subversive themes of their Indian counterparts. Nor to they have the energy! The energy in 3 Idiots is so incredibly infectious, if youre not smiling in the first five minutes you might need defibrillation. Seriously call a doctor, youre legally dead.Those who are worried about Chinas looming domination of Asia and eventual world power status need not worry about it. If I were worried about any country flexing its muscle itd be India. Its a polyglot, multicultural nation with English its language of commerce. Its got a huge, pro-democratic population and has the creative juices to pull off long-term economic and cultural growth. But dont lose any sleep over the decline of the American Empire, at least our overlords will be benevolent or at the very least hilarious.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com 
This movie is really meaningful to us Asians	Vietnam	The very fact that the education system in my country (and perhaps in a lot of developing countries) SUCKS and as a student, I am seriously suffering from it, makes this movie worth watching. It gives me a little hope, a little faith, that success and happiness will eventually come to those who pursue excellence in stead of just focusing on their grades, their qualifications. I guess that many Western people cannot understand what Asian students like me are going through. We have to study all day, I mean, studying is not only a 7 to 5 job but it also deprive us of our sleep. The working environment is so damn competitive, our parents are like get straight As or you will have nothing to eat and the stress is unbearable. So, if you are having to deal with all these, give this movie a try! Good laughs, great messages, enjoyable story. 
An undeniable masterpiece	Singapore	One of my students - a girl, once asked me how would she know if she has found the right guy. I told her I dont know how but I shared with her a method to sieve out the useless ones. Get them to watch 2 films with you and watch for their reactions. If the first reaction is I dont watch silly Japanese cartoons and musical Hindi flicks, discard them like used tissue papers because they are not worth your time. Why? Because they already have deep-set perceived ideas and worse of all, they will not even give it a chance, not even for you. Then if they do want to watch them, watch for their reactions. If they give snide and self-important remarks, hello-goodbye them out of your life. The 2 movies that I suggested to her were My Neighbour Totoro and 3 Idiots. I saw 3 Idiots again today and I am surprised its only my second time. But it feels like only just yesterday that I got to know the 3 musketeers - Farhan, Raju and Rancho. I think thats one of the reason why its so successful - their easy chemistry. The 3 characters arcs are so divisive (each focusing on different aspects of the pursuit of education) but yet so intertwined because of their deep friendship. At the end, I remember walking out of the cinema learning life lessons from a master. This time round watching it at home, I realize why I love it so much. Most films only have one central theme and all the plot revolves around that. 3 Idiots has bigger aspirations - it was deftly balancing multiple themes. It didnt only delve on aspects of education, it also hit on subjects like superficiality, parenting, treating people right etc. In my opinion, one of the reasons why the film succeeds is that it wasnt preachy. It didnt need 10 minutes to force the schmaltz down your throat, it just throws the idea out there and it hits home. Take a look at Jack Neos Im Not Stupid, same big subject but you will vomit out all the top-down schmaltz by the end of the movie. I think 3 Idiots realizes that these ideas for living your life and the pursuit of excellence are in all of our consciousness... We all know them but we just never act against them and allowed it to permeate our lives from way back. The film only needs to throw out the ideas, package them in a fresh approach and it hits the home run. None of the ideas needed to linger longer than it was necessary. I love the narrative structure which is actually a road movie. Most directors will just do tough love in a linear manner. 3 Idiots uses flashback very effectively. If you think about it, we are only seeing Farhans version of Rancho for 95% of the film. How do we know thats the real version? The real Rancho only appears right at the end. The use of screwball comedy works remarkably well too. In fact, the tone switches like the mind of an idiot suffering from a tri-polar complex. For instance, in the ending of the second act, the birthing of Monas baby in the midst of the biggest flood and rain. I loathe these birthing scenes in movies. Always feel like some fake big life affirming moment but seeing how it is handled here I am so awed. Not pretentious and look at how the tone switches like crazy - from sad (expulsion from ICE), to tension (no transport to the hospital and no electricity), to full-on problem solving (the theme of what education is for culminates here), to comedy, to celebration, back to total sadness again (death of baby) and to the closing metaphor of All Izz Well. Freaking brilliant. It was then I realized the director builds up the All Izz Well metaphor all through the film until that point. And it didnt end there. That last speech by the professor to Rancho in the driving rain closed up, no, bookended what actually began in their first meeting where Rancho asks why didnt the astronauts use a pencil in space. This is what CLASS is about and this film has truckloads of it. The only misstep for me is the romance angle between Pia and Rancho wasnt totally satisfying. Their cute meet is really awesome but if Pia has learned anything from Rancho, why would she still want to marry Mr Pricetag in the end? I know it was just a narrative ploy to get all the parties together for the final journey to meet Rancho but it didnt feel right for me. But really, I am just nitpicking. I apologize if I let out some spoilers but seriously if you have not seen this, you must be the type of person that I mentioned about in the first paragraph. 
Amazing, inspiring and enchanting - one of best movies I have seen	Lithuania	Talking about unexpected When you see the title of the movie and know that it was best grossing Bollywood film that went around the world as a hit all around  well, you expect something watered down, something for everyone. Maybe in some way it is for everyone, but by far this is not bad.The message is simple  follow your heart, follow your dream and All Izz Good (a little chant of main character  Rancho  used in stressful situations). In India engineering is a prestigious occupation where many Indian parents see as future for their sons. Story is set in Nr. 1 Imperial Engineering University where our 3 main characters  Farhan, Raju and Rancho - meet. Most students are there to blindly cram book, get best scores in exams, get good job and buy big houses and big cars. But Rancho is different  he loves engineering and does not like the school system, he tries to change it. Sounds familiar? Well it is. But this is story is special. It is about real friendship, real emotions and a person who is able to inspire people, shake their mechanical lives, and wake them up. (Oh, and it has Bollywood song-and-dance cuts too, a lot of fun). It is indeed very pleasant to watch.As usual I would like to ponder upon one of notions of the movie. We all in our lives are faced with important choices and struggle to answer dilemmas they give us. Who should we listen to when we choose most important things in our lives  the Tradition, our Parents and Grandparents, our God or Gods, our Friends, our Hearts or our Rational Mind? It is tough. Sometimes it seems to me it was easier in the times when you knew from childhood who you will be  a son of blacksmith will be a blacksmith, a son of tanner most probably will be a tanner (well, for girls even more easy  marriage  but thats another topic). In Hindu philosophy, in Bhagavad Gita, a similar question is discussed. A great hero Arjuna I faced with a dilemma  he has to fight the battle, as he is kshatriya, warrior cast, however in this case he would have to kill people he knows and loves. He consults his chariot driver - god Krishna. Krishna tries to persuade him to fulfill his duty, his dharma as kshatriya. It is better to be mediocre warrior if this is your dharma, than to be best cook in the world and go against it. A philosophy difficult to pursue in life, especially in modern world. I personally think that since industrial revolution and alienation of worker and his/her work (to borrow the term from Marx), there is no way to see the profession, a job in the same way as it used to be (like I mentioned  son of tanner is tanner, but it was not a job in nowadays meaning). Our jobs are almost a consumer choice, just usually more permanent one. You choose your career along with it comes the attached lifestyle (a doctors lifestyle is different from engineers, and it is not only about the money, it has much to do with the constructed image of the profession). So in ambiguity of modern world, what does constitute as dharma? Rancho says it is voice of your heart.The movie has a happy ending. And if it is not pretentious enough for some critics  well, eh I think some things need to have a happy ending.P.S. I wonder how many engineering students in India dropped out after seeing this movie

A Modern Day Classic!	United States	First he taught us that laughter is the best medicine. With his second venture, he taught us the ways of piece and love through Ghandism. Now, with 3 Idiots, Rajkumar Hirani tells us to chase excellence and success will follow.Im a viewer who believes the best way to send a message is through an entertaining way rather than a preachy way. A message through entertainment hits you harder than a boring and preachy one. Films, of course, are not meant to send messages, but its always nice to see one that does. I honestly believe nobody can do it better than Raju Hirani - Currently the best director of Hindi Cinema.Like his previous attempts, Raju Hirani makes us laugh, cry and think all in one viewing. 3 Idiots not only introduces you to a new world, but also provides a fresh way of filmmaking and narration. Not to forget that it tackles an issue that not many have touched upon - The Education System.Years after graduating from college, Farhan and Raju receive a message from an old classmate, Chatur. Chatur claims that he has found their old buddy Rancho. Rancho, a free mind, an intelligent student, a good guy. Why is Rancho so important? What exactly did Rancho do? Why did he leave? Will Farhan and Raju find him? All that is depicted in the next nearly 3 hours of the movie.To start, 3 Idiots deals with a few things here and there. Whether it is the poor school system that discriminates and pressures you involving your grades. Whether its you father forcing you to become an engineer and not allowing you to pursue your dreams. Or even a bright student who fears he may not be able to live up to the high expectations. Finally, 3 Ididots says one simple thing - Chase your dreams, demolish your fears and try your best - Success is a given.There are a number of significant moments I totally love in the movie. Aamirs introduction itself is a great start. Ill go on and say another lovely scene is when Farhan and Raju come last and find out where Rancho placed. Of Course, who can forget Chaturs hilarious Balatkaar speech Just Genius writing. There are more moments to cherish here. The whole climax is lovely. Mona Singhs baby delivery is gripping. Finally, Ranchos real identify being shown keeps you glued and enlightened all at once.My favorite part of the film is when Farhan and Raju decide their fates. Farhan confronting his father about his real dreams and Rajus interview - Just amazing moments.Flaws? I really dont see any. I do want to note that the film is almost 3 hours yet you do not feel like it has been that long.Rajkumar Hirani and his co writer really developed a nearly flawless script here. The lines are just amazing. They are fresh and also have that feel-goodness to them. The screenplay is excellent.The music of the movie grows on you. All Izz Well lifts your spirit. Give Me Some Sunshine is amazing. Behti Hawa is also an underrated song. Songs are pictured well.R. Madhavan gives his best performance in my opinion. His voice over is also a master stroke. Hes got a strange innocence to him him this film. It works. Sharman Joshi is no less. Hes just first rate. Especially in the scene when he goes to give his interview.Kareena Kapoor is actually acting well here. A great act. Boman Irani is first rate as always. Hes just brilliant. His character is sort of similar to his earlier character in Raju Hiranis first film, Munnabhai MBBS. However, theres a huge distinction in Bomans act. Shows the mans versatility.Aamir Khan holds 3 Idiots together all through. I feel he should have gotten the best actor award that year instead of Amitabh Bachchan in Paa (That was a great act too) He looks the role, hes just perfect in every frame. You dont really expect anything less than that from Mr. Khan.All said and done, even Aamir would agree with me that the real hero of this film is Raj Kumar Hirani, the director. Hes filled the movie with so many wonderful moments, extracted some memorable performances and has given one of the most entertaining films to Indian Cinema.What else can I say? Just a big thanks to director Raj Kumar Hirani, producer Vinod Chopra and actor Aamir Khan for giving us this modern day classic.In Munnabhi MBBS - It was a jadho ki jhappi In Lage Raho Munnabhai - It was Get well soon, mamu And now, its - ALL IZZ WELL! 
makes you feel alright	Turkey	I have a 17 year old daughter preparing for college;this morning i told her to watch the movie and even to invite her schoolmates to watch it together.The movie is really entertaining,very well directed,the actors trying to do their best.&#x130;t has all the features of Indian cinema,colorful,bright,dancing sequences,songs.I want to believe in ranchos philosophy,though unfortunately i am aware that those thoughts are very naive regarding the real world of jungle.all college students,the ones preparing to be and most importantly,their parents should spare some time for this movie.if all the people in the world behaved like that all would be so fine:)thanks to all the production and casting crew.. 
Classic of 2010	Bahrain	December 2009 was a month of blockbusters starting with Paa,then Rocket Singh-Salesman of The Year,then Avatar 3D and last 3 Idiots. 3 Idiots is a masterpiece in the History of Bollywood Movies. Rajkumar Hirani deserves standing ovation for his work. The music is very good.Aal Izz Well topping. The cinematography is great.Performance wise-Even though everyone act well in their respective roles.It is Omi Vaidya who shines as Chatur Ramalingam.Remove him,3 Idiots would have ended up being dull.Watch his speech scene and its sure going to make you laugh.Aamir Khan is excellent as Phunsukh Wangdu.Sharman Joshi as Raju Rastogi is also good.Madhavan is amazing as Farhan Qureshi.Boman Irani is stupendous as Viru Sahsrabudhe aka VIRUS.Kareena Kapoor is okay.Overall 3 Idiots is Bollywoods masterpiece. 
Best  Bollywood movie Ive ever watched	None	One thing that comes to our mind when we say Bollywood is fancy stories with dream worlds. They are far for reality and almost nothing to take from it. But this movie stands still as a giant proving that Bollywood isnt all about synthetic dream worlds. This is a classic masterpiece with the combination of geniuses.Aamir khan my favorite actor in Bollywood shows here, he not just another actor but a man of wisdom. There are high class Bollywood celebrities, acting in very cheap movies even jeopardizing their well built reputation. One thing I notice on Aamir Khan is that he is not after each and every role only seek for the excellence. As he becomes successful with his career, he improves the way of thinking too. This maturity can be clearly visible in his productions too. (He could be the only Bollywood celebrity with a brain :)The plot of this movie is quite interesting and never get bored. Humor, Joy, Sorrow , feeling and everything is there. The specialty that tied my attention to this movie is the Dialogs. They are really a work of a genius. Ranchos dialogs as a college student perfectly call into our wisdom. They contains the thoughts of a philosopher. The message given by the movie is astonishing by the end. if its summarized, Dont follow the success, only the excellence. Then success will follow youThis could be the movie that would change my life one day. 
Its a movie	United States	Yes - it is a bit long. Yes - It is a bit unbelievable. Yes - it has old jokes. But the point is, it is a movie, not a documentary on global warming where the facts are supposed to be facts (really?) What I liked? The pace of the movie (assuming you remove some scenes like that baby delivery or bride kidnapping). The jokes are effective because they are well executed, acted, and the timing is just right. So are the melodramatic scenes. The acting is fine. Was impressed by Sharman Joshi. Aamir Khan (a bit old for the role) has always delivered. Omi has portrayed his character well.A few points. The plane scene is not a realistic one (then neither is Rambo or Air Force One). And, in this day and age, how can you not locate a rich guy who is making half a million dollar a month in small town India! The whole inverter idea with the baby delivery scene! Wow! The climax was a feel-gooder, but not appropriate as the message got lost. Boman Irani should have been a part of the climax and should have learned his lesson then.Oh, well. It is just a movie. When you compare it to other Holly and Bolly movies (which have similar flaws), this one does stand out as a good entertainer. Definitely worth seeing, I would say.. 
old formula again	India	If over the top unrealistic comedy is what entertains you, then this movie is just for you. There are lots of pissing and fart jokes. Somehow some people never grow up.This movie is entirely unrealistic.Everything is too spic and span, colorful to give the viewer lots of eye candy. Most of the first half of the storyline revolves around students outsmarting the teachers. Young people are going to love this, but the jokes are so ancient that the professors might very well have known them. It beats me how the studious guy got away after insulting the director and the minister. Then again this is mindless entertainment. Picturesque scenes are aplenty with long drives along hilly roads. Cinematography is good, we get guided tours through the hills of himachal and kashmir. However the songs are retarded. Aamir Khan, bless him, is not a college kid anymore. I know hes the best actor in business, and he does a decent job here, but does that mean we cant try out young talents? The shooting style, character development, even music at times are similar to Munnabhai MBBS. That was a great movie, but why do it again? The second half is plain old Hindi movie with lots of crying. Most of it is predictable. Then again, this is mindless entertainment and youre not supposed to think.Sometimes the story is plain stupid. It maybe the case that people are made to strip during the ragging days, but does that mean they will drop their pants whenever the emotions soar? Would you strip to underpants in front of your best friend and his girlfriend? This is so unlike India.Things good about the movie are cinematography, Sharman Joshi and the message. However, since everyone is shutting their brains, I doubt anyone would carry the message out of the theatre into real life. If you are a college student, would you stop cramming before exams and start learning the stuff? If banners and star casts attract you, go see it. Otherwise, avoid this. You wont miss much.With such a good novel as a background and such good actors with a great director, this is pretty much a waste of resources. 
Aal izz... aalmost perfect.	India	Perfect. Almost. Oh yeah... those are the words! Im writing this at the 8th hour of the morning of 25th December. Merry Christmas, viewers, this is the perfect treat. I was lucky enough to have caught a special preview of the years best movie, 3 Idiots, last night. Aamir Khan fans, after a disastrous Ghajini, prepare to be truly delighted! He once again shows his perfectionist attitude with this highly-anticipated soon-to-be blockbuster! It has EVERYTHING - from good humour, to emotions that actually move you. When a sense of fear is supposed to be created, it is created, and when youre supposed to feel good, you do! Remarkable performances by each and every one of the characters just adds to the entire effect. A nice-to-listen-to soundtrack assures you that even the song sequences arent boring. And over that, such beautiful choreography! Witty dialogues and hilarious one-liners keep you wanting for more, and some head-bobbing suspense makes you wonder as well...But, above all, above EVERYTHING else, what truly, TRULY makes this movie work is Rajkumar Hiranis brilliant sense of direction. How he cuts between the past and the present, at the perfect moments, is just amazing. With this, he could finally emerge as one of the leading directors of the country today.3 Idiots is based on the book Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat, even though its hugely different. And, for the first time in my life, I can proudly say that yes, finally, a movie has not just done justice to the book, but easily surpassed it. All thanks to Rajkumar Hirani. And proudly too because an Indian did it! I have to be strict... its an Aamir Khan movie. So I have no option but to cut off 1 for the editing and dubbing errors.9/10. What more do you want? Dont miss it for anything! 
Overrated	India	Okay!!! Dont get me wrong when I say the movie is overrated. The movie is great, its entertaining, its fun to watch with a group. But, when you watch it more than once, you will find so many flaws with it that it is sometimes embarrassing. Also the movie is very long with lots of unnecessary and silly scenes in it. The movie could have been great if the editing department would have been better.Some scenes and characters are exaggerated. The delivery scene is weird. But, all things considered, it is good movie. It has all the right emotions to pull the viewer in and hold him till the end. But the movie is a bit clichd for my liking. Go for it if you like the typical Bollywood stuff and this movie will entertain you every time you watch it. 
A hilarious and very much Bollywood conceptualization of 2 stories	None	Its definitely a fun movie, without doubt. Copied ideas? Yes! Melded a whole lot of stories that the Indian audience dont know? Yes! Made it purely entertaining and relate-able to the Indian mass? Yes!!Whats wrong then? Should have given credit to the stuff they were inspired from... so that we could check out those classics too afterwards and appreciate the original work too.You should definitely see 3 Idiots, before seeing the inspirations to totally appreciate the work. And after watching the movie... give a couple of weeks (if u liked it) and then watch The Paper Chase (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070509/) and read the book Five Point Someone (by Chetan Bhagat). Both the old school movie and the book are definitely worth reading and makes you appreciate the movie that bring all these together. *spoiler* There was a hilarious scene which I later found out was from a NZ commercial. Watch this only after watching and appreciating the movie :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXRZcJI9yx8*spoiler end*Watch 3 Idiots if you have not read Chethan Bhagath prior to it. Read the book after if you havent already...because that was 1 of his books worth appreciating. Watch The Paper Chase also afterwards. You can even just listen through parts of it instead of actually watching...rather than listening to the menagerie of songs that gets you off track in 3 idiots at times. 
Now that, is a movie! Enjoyable. Fun. Unique. Brilliant. Emotional.	Slovenia	May I add to that, potentially life-changing!I would rate this movie somewhere between 9 and 10 , I wasnt sure which grade to give it, but 10 seems more appropriate.This movie actually , has many flaws. And I know I often watch a movie then rate it with a 5/10 , then rumble about its flaws.. But, sometimes there is just something that you love and in it the flaws are minimized and overlooked. So it is with this movie for me. I love love love how inspiring it is. And how it can bring the emotions out of you. Make you connect and feel with the characters! This is simply amazing! Not many movies can do that. There are 2 or 3 scenes that I adore, and then there are others, flawed and all.. but still this movie is just special. A must watch. It starts a bit slow.. but you have to be patient. First half is good, second half is awesome! The cast in this movie is perfect! Amir, his friends, the teacher , the girl. Just perfect. And really the girl was an important role to cast and she is such a good choice! Looks wise at first you would think hmmm maybe not so much; but that girl has a spark that you will not find. I saw her in one other movie and so I knew what she could do, and surely as movie rolls along , she adds her sparkly personality and lifts the movie a notch higher. Aamir Khan has become my favorite Indian actor, and is perfect in this, and the professor is also such a good choice! Just wow! Why do I go on and on about the cast, because this cast made the movie what it is. Its not about how well you act, its how well a role you are put into based on who you are. A super good movie! Different from Hollywood, very refreshing!Real rating: 9.35 
3 Idoits! :)	Turkey	I thought I was going to see some Bollywood version of American Pie or something. But this is truly a fantastic, thoughtful, well-made film! But this films title will mislead a lot of people thinking this is some mindless teen flick. I will do my best and recommend everyone I know to see it!Very nice songs in the film. Zoobi Doobi and All is well. Aamir Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Boman Irani are very successful. My favorite player in the serious Aamir Khan!My favorite player in the character Raju because he is a very intelligent person.Great movie! Definitely see it.
