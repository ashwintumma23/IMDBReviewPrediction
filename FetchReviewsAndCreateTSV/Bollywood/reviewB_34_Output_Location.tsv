Farhan has done wonders	Varanasi, India	Few critics, few including Rediff ones whom I look for some good writing, have rated low to BMB. The reason they give is that movie lacks coherence and clarity. Really? I think they should only rate Hollywood movies because whoever thinks this movie is no good does not know what Hindi cinema is. Farhan has done an awesome job, and if I say awesome then it is not for his physique and dialogue delivery but for the transformation, he has gone to become Milkha Singh. We as an audience witness the physical stress and labor that an athlete as likes of Milkha Singh undergo to become a flying Sikh. Hindi cinema celebrates the life of this living legend with songs and drama and music. Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra has done a decent job, still; I fell he could have done a lot better especially in the scenes of Milkhas childhood memories. His attempt of giving the movie an epic convention seriously affected the narrative portion. However, all this can be sided by the grandeur of Farhans effort. I would like to mention a statement of one of the rediff users who wrote against critics who are undermining the effect of this movie: note that 400mtrs is a very difficult race to run. it is at the border of quick races and long jogs. after partition India did not have either the experience nor the infra to produce runners for 400mtrs. So Milkha was a true champion in every sense. If critics pull films like these down for abstract reasonswe will forever have 20 goons flying in the air with one punch from one man. Grow up critics.So true. 
Farhan Akhtar, an epitome of extreme dedication towards the character	India	I would certainly be disappointed if this movie doesnt get nominated for the best foreign language film in the academy awards. Farhan Akhtar is like the epitome of dedication towards Milkha Singhs character. He was running like a pro. Cinematography was just amazing. Many shots were just breathtaking. Direction was just perfect and the casting was sensibly done. Parallel storytelling kept the movie balanced between Milkha Singhs life and his sports career. The trio of Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy did their job as always. But one of all, Farhan Akhtar rocked. He has always given his best in every field he has ever stepped in to. Respect for Farhan Akhtar, respect for Milkha Singh, the true hero. 
Bollywood needs a better class of directors, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is gonna give you that	India	I know this film is criticized for being overlong, but there is not a moment where you will get bored. Based on the real life story of an awesome athlete The Flying Sikh Milkha Singh, the story solely revolves around the hardships and horrors of his life. The whole film in a sense, is perfect.Director: Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra Now, i dont think i have to tell you about his past achievements. After delivering one of the greatest blockbuster of bollywood Rang De Basanti, Mehra is back with a bang!!!!! Direction is superb with almost no loopholes left to be noticed.Scriptwriter: Prasoon Joshi This National Awardee (Taare Zameen Par) needs no introduction. Script of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has been beautifully transcribed and and more beautifully presented on the silver screen.Actor: Farhan Akhtar yes, this is solely a Farhan Akhtar movie. This multi talented person has put his heart and sole in the movie. His talent can only be judged by his dedication. Farhan Akhtars talent has been put to justice. And Pavan Malhotras role as Coach Gurudev Singh also fits.All in all, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a must watch for all movie lovers, sports lovers and Indian History lovers!!!!! 
Truly Inspiring... Bhaag Milkha!	United Arab Emirates	BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is a biopic directed by Rakyesh Omprakash Mehra, starring Farhan Akthar and Sonam Kapoor.The film revolves around the life story of Milkha Singh.Everyone who is associated with this film has done a GREAT job. The directors... the writers... the actors... EVERYONE. When the first look of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag came, we were shocked how similar Farhan Akthar looked like Milkha Singh, and his acting has showed us that not only is he a GREAT actor, but he can mostly do any role by now. His portrayal of Milkha Singh was outstanding.The film starts off a BIT slow, but you manage to keep with its pace. Inspite of the film being 3h10m, you never feel bored; instead, you find yourself stuck in the world of Milkhaji- poverty, love and speed.The replay value of this film is very high. Its very entertaining.The acting, as said above, is very good. Other than Farhan Akthar delivering an award-winning performance, every other actor did a great job. Sonam Kapoor didnt have much to do in the screenplay, but she did it quite well.The film does depend on each persons likes and tastes. A person who enjoys watching the so-called masala flicks, may not enjoy this film due to its different type of story compared to other films. Also, people who cant sit in cinemas for a VERY long time may get annoyed at the fact that its a 3h10m film.But Overall, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is an award-winning film. It shows us the life of Milkha Singh through his very own eyes and deserves a standing ovation for its performances, writing and direction. Truly Inspiring...Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!- 10/10 
A commendable film on Milkha Singhs inspiring tale!	Mumbai	The sheer joy of watching someones hard-work come to life on the screen is inspiring indeed. To portray Milkha Singhs struggle and achievements and his zeal to succeed at the world stage, required an equally earnest and dedicated effort by the filmmakers. This effort is reflected in Bhag Milkha Bhag, and is what makes the film commendable.Farhan Akhtars tough physical training for this role pays great dividends on screen. The races look pretty convincing because of Farhans effort and soon you find yourself cheering for Milkha, if not loudly in the movie-hall then at-least in your head.The non-linear narrative of the film keeps the movie engrossing, so although you know the basic outline of the story, you cant really guess what would happen next. The story is narrated by Milkhas coach Gurudev Singh played brilliantly Pavan Malhotra by who first recognizes the Milkha Singhs talent.The women in Milkha Singhs life play a very important role, be it his elder sister (played by Divya Dutta)who single handedly brings Milkha up, or the love of his life (Sonam Kapoor) who is the reason why he changes his unruly ways. Although one must add, that the part where Milkha goes on a romp after a party with Stella(Rebecca Brooks) during the 1956 Melbourne Games does look a bit forced.Some people may have qualms with the dance sequences but personally they were quite enjoyable and didnt jar the narrative. Keep an eye out for the song with Sonam Kapoor who plays Milkha Singhs love interest in the film. The shot with them both on top of a bridge with green, swiftly flowing water below was captured beautifully.The director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has a signature style which is apparent like from his previous films- Rang De Basanti and Delhi-6. He can merge music and visuals to great effect. Although in some scenes a little bit of restraint in the stylistic details and drama could have certainly helped.To emerge as a world leading athlete from India just after independence, when I suppose sports facilities werent great, with the scars of the partition deep in his mind is some achievement. We salute you Milkha Singh! One must commend the efforts of the filmmakers to bring the story to us. 
Heroism, dedication and roar of an Indian wounded Lion....Bhaag Milkha Bhaag	None	If Milkha Singh is a Hero this movie is Heroic! This Biopic have been excellently crafted by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, nicely scripted by Prasoon Joshi, storytelling is nice and sequence of events have been placed aptly. It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you feel empathetic for Milkha, his partition affected fellows and communities. Right from the word go till finish this flick will keep you glued to your seats. Brilliantly performed by Farhan Akhtar along with other co-stars, with a special mention for Pavan Malhotra (Gurudev Singh, Milkhas initial trainer  coach). Full marks to Farhan for his efforts, acting, dedication for the role, for getting completely into the skin of Milkha Singh and for being an authentic Milkha! To me, it would be no surprise if he fetches a National Award for this role! Milkha Singh runs against turbulent times of his life and establishes world records; conquers not just medals for India, but Indian hearts too! A big salute and cheers for this national hero!This is a true tribute to this Indian, Flying Sikh! And, if you want to be inspired, motivated and get a going in your personal life then go for it! 
MY REVIEW: Run Farhan Run!!	Jaipur, India	Bhaag Milkha Bhaag works for two basic reasons. One it is based on the story of a sports person whose personal life is dramatic enough to keep you engaged apart from its racing track achievements and second it is played by Farhan Akhtar who plays his role as if he is really Milkha Singh himself. Farhan Akhtar excels playing Milkha Singh like Ben Kingsley excelled playing Gandhi. Farhan Akhtar seems to be enjoying every bit of the movie. When he runs, he runs like a tiger. When he dances, he dances like a pure Punjabi. When he loves, he loves with innocence and passion. Farhan Akhtar can easily be given all best actor awards of 2013. All supporting actors give their best. Divya Dutta is excellent, Sonam Kapoor looks fresh, Pawan Malhotra and Parkash Rajs performance are heartwarming. Music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is first rate and awe inspiring. Rakeyesh Omprakash Mehra like an expert captain provides movie its uniqueness, technical perfection, soul and purpose. Like an every fantastic experience, this also comes with its dull moments. Movie takes around extra half an hour before reaching to its finale. Rangrezz song could have been avoided and prolonged sequences of Milkhas achievements could have been shortened. Dilip Tahil playing Pandit Nehru looks like a missed stroke. At the end, you can safely say, you had a great time running with Farhan Akhtar for more than 3 hours. Run to your nearest theater now to watch this powerful biopic. 
Milkha Singh Has Won. So Has The Biographical Film. Everybody Rise! &#x2666; 80%	the Entertainment Capital of India	In less than ten minutes into the film, you get goosebumps all over your body. You get into high-spirits and then the story of The Flying Sikh begins...It talks more about perseverance and how man can excel even in the worst conditions than the actual atheltic history. Milkha Singh, wonderfully portrayed by the talented Farhan Akhtar is one character that induces inspiration. Akhtar now has totally proved himself as a successful actor. His demeanor is appreciable and the film does showcase his hard-work. Supporting cast is very good as well. But, the actresses were sidelined which is very apt for a bio-film.Most of the story is told in flashbacks and there is where the screenplay works. It grabs your attention. The childhood story MAY bore you a little, but every other biopic has to be honest. Much like last years Paan Singh Tomar, BMB does have lots of surprises in store. The relation of every detail is astronomical and very well adapted. Fresh writing, inventive editing  below-average SFX/CGI makes me wanna give it a humble 8.0/10.The songs  score are energetic which do cause an urge that we run with the athletes on-screen. That is the power of Rakeysh O Mehra and his crew. I was blown away by Akhtars bod and his expressions. Humor touches the script at times, as well.Overall, an entertaining biography which is well-written and well- executed. Only, the running time of 190 minutes COULDVE... couldve been shortened. Otherwise, everybody rise for this cinema of massive potential.BOTTOM LINE: A very good entertainer with mentoring prowess. It feels good that the team has brought an epitome into reel. Kudos!Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YESProfanity: No | Nudity: Mild | Sex/Foreplay/Mouth-Kiss: Mild | Violence/Gore: Strong | Alcohol: Mild | Smoking/Drugs: No

India	wow wow wow ! what a movie BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG ! this movie is exceptional, the best biography that i have ever witnessed whether in Hollywood or bollywood! just watch it ! rather make it compulsory for the students of class 9-12 so that they could understand the anguish and agony of being motivated and in turn achieve what u actually desire! the movie is completely abt what MILKHA SINGH WAS ! he was an athlete ??? no ! he was something beyond we have known to him ! if i say that the best bollywood movie of all time then believe me i am telling the truth ! Farhan Akhtar is the soul of the movie, this movie completely revolves around him and his desire to achieve success and struggle in life ! he is my favorite after this one ! all the other cast have been great and done justice to their roles. sonam had a little to do but she contributed well ! from direction to screen play , cinematography to acting everything worth watching ! a 200 minute movie needs at least a time of more than 3.5 hrs to watch it , but one would not move from the seat after entering into the theater ! hats off to whole cast and crew ! **********(10 stars) 
Milkha bann gaya India - A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT!!	India	I watched a Paid-Preview of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag last night and I was star-strucked by its fame watching the house-full crowd in the theater (as if it is the first day of the release). When I first watched its teaser in October last year and first trailer in January..it had me going since then, and now I am happy that my expectation was worth it.BRIEF STORY  REVIEW SKETCH. The film is about Milkha Singh and introspects his being through the eyes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra. There are no twists or turns in the movie but its just a tale told on a clean slate. Film starts with a defeat in Olympics, carried on when Milkha refuses to visit Pakistan (has his valid reasons for doing so) but Pt. Nehru sends Milkhas latter and former coach to Chandigarh so that they can convince him for the tour. During the train-journey, Pavan Malhotra (former coach) reveals the story of Milkha Singh and his reason to not visit Pakistan to the other two gentlemen which unleashes an assiduous, interesting and penultimate story about the legend. This Sikh has been running his whole life, starting his first race for a glass of milk to the Olympics..and never ending. It reminds me of the great metaphor  The race of Life. Milkha Singh ran to save his life, to eat, to dream, for love, for country, for passion and to overcome his own personal fears, and what a run it was!. BMB traces his scarred childhood, brutalized by Indias partition ; followed by penury and petty crimes. He finds the purpose of life when he falls for Beeru (Sonam). Joins the Indian Army and since then his passion, eagerness and situations along with the efforts (negative  positive both) made by different people led him to become an athlete, a runner who remained uncased even by his own daemons. He keeps on breaking records but witnesses a heartbreaking defeat in Rome Olympics (1960) but thats not it, he takes it in his stride, overcomes his catastrophic past which was the cause of Olympic defeat and emerges out to be a clear winner.OVERVIEWROPM delivers yet again a tale in his own style (fond of changing tones in his films), where the length is bit of a disappointment otherwise the content heals the flaw with a superb execution and sticky pace, that tops with Farhan Akhtars outstanding performance (the actor gave his blood n sweat into the character) and he emerges out to be the soul of the movie physically and mentally. The story by Prasoon Joshi is admirable and the track Zinda is well written by him, beautifully composed by Shankar, Ehsaan, Loy and descriptively choreographed by Shaimak Davar. The background score by the trio adds on to the whole movie. The performances from the other cast is noticeable where Divya Dutta deserves a special mention (Hats off to the lady for creating a great impact in spite of having such a small role) The film truly deserves to be one of the best that Bollywood has offered this year so far and I hope to see some more in-depth biopics like this in coming future.Id rate this dig-till-hell marvel biopic as 8/10. 
yet another class delivered by ROMP	UP India	What a movie ! awesome the way farhan act ,the way rakeysh directed ,everything movie was superb and all the time it has mesmerized the audience through out the movie .Again no word to appreciate farhan acting ,he is a extremely talented actor and he showed up in the same way .My Voting for this is 4.5 out of 5 .In terms of IMDb I am amazed till now I am not seeing any rating of the movie and saying waiting for 5 vote for commencing the voting ,any how this movie is a purely inspired by the milkha singh . I Like the way flash back was going on ,it was a shattering flashback that was amazing to watch ,every time when the movie was going in the flashback it was awesome experience to watch it .love this movie . 
Farhan Akhter deserves a National award for this!!!	Chandigarh	Well I was not excited enough for this movie, but when the trailers started coming and then the music, my curiosity began to flourish little bit. But the main reason I went to saw this movie was because I heard almost 50-60 review from my friends and not even single person had a negative review against it. And when I saw this, it really blew me away because it had many mixtures which made this movie work. First of all FARHAN AKHTER is at its best, no doubt its his best performance till date. It was like we were seeing real Milkha Singh on screen. Divya Dutta is awesome, Pavan Malhotra, Yograj Singh  Prakash Raj have really performed well. Sonam Kapoor is completely waste though her role was very little, so you wont miss her. Rebecca Breeds looks fabulous, Dilip Tahil as Jawahar Lal Nehru was not a master stroke. Screenplay was good, music was fabulous and the background score really kept the life in each and every scene. Rakesh Omprakash Mehras best work till date also. YOU DARE TO MISS THIS ONE ON YOUR OWN RISK !!! 
What a Movie WAF	Mumbai, India	What a dam Good Movie.... Its one of the must see movie... Apart from true story, the movie is very motivational and it will suck within while watching.... however at time in flashbacks its slow, but for a minute or so... but it takes off so high when it comes to race and sprite.... its kind of movie you can compare it with Rocky series from Sylvester StalloneAll to All... loved watching this movie... apart from its 3:08 minutes long... ;)Must watch movie...10 Star Rating!! 
Review of negative reviews	None	Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a great movie according to me. Unfortunately, it has received reviews from both extremes. The people who have disliked the movie because of its pace are very impatient souls. The movies depth is only understood when the mind is tuned to the perfectly timed pace of events of the movie. I read a review that said for a fast runner movie, it is extremely slow paced. There is no damn connection between between a life story of a runner and the pace of the movie. I think such reviewers are so used to reviewing commercial non-sensical masala films that they have forgotten what real movies are like.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a movie that is crafted for excellence by the very second. 
The most revolutionary biopic India has ever seen	United States	Upon looking at Rakeysh Omprakash Mehras previous films, one can easily identify a consistent trend of story lines based on the theme of patriotism. Despite being one of the most effective elements of this film, the idea of country pride has been repeatedly portrayed by a variety of directors including Ashutosh Gowariker, Manoj Kumar, and JP Duttabut many times, without success. Some examples of these attempts include Mangal Pandey: The Rising and LOC Kargil. One might wonder what differentiates these films from a film like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. The answer lies within the movies script as well as its directorial elements. Instead of generating a story full of clichs and larger than life characteristics, Prasoon Joshis writing of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag exemplifies a grounded recollection of Milkha Singhs life which instills an idea of realism in the viewers mind. The idea of portraying the protagonists vulnerability in the script created a level of acceptance in the audiences mind which most Bollywood films fail to do due to the directors attempts of adding the so-called masala aspect, which according to some, adds commercial value to a film. Throughout this films opening sequence, a variety of camera angles and color schemes were used which not only empowered the introduction of the protagonist, but also foreshadowed the elements about his past. An example of this was seen when Milkha was introduced to the audience in the opening race and suddenly, the screen transitioned into a black and white frame symbolizing his dreadful experiences during the partition of India. Particularly the use of the long shot during running sequences was able to capture the level of intensity the runner experienced during each race. Mehras choice of camera-work not only created a conceptual feel for the film, but also generated a visual understanding of a runners triumph. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag delivers primarily with its use of the flashback. The films constant cuts between various phases of Milkha Singhs life prompted a level of anticipation in the viewers minds which holds on until the climax of the film. Perhaps the only flaw within the directorial elements of this film was its occasional use of visual effects. The most obvious instance of lackluster technology could be seen during the sequence when Milkha Singh is reintroduced as a young man running on top of a train. The green screen behind Farhan Akhtars mid-shot is far below par in this scene and makes the scene look dull in comparison to the other visual accomplishments of the film. One of the most effective uses of visual effects was seen throughout the various racing events in the film. Mehras direction revolutionizes the way historical films are shot by his technique of merging historical footage to scenes shot with the actual actors. An example of this was shown in the opening where Farhan Akhtar lined up alongside actual runners from the 1950s era. In addition to the story, screenplay and direction, the actors performances in this film were of international grade. Farhan Akhtar not only physically transformed himself, but also took the time to understand Milkha Singhs Punjabi lingo at its highest authenticity. From a commercial standpoint, the scenes that stand out the most in this film are those where the protagonists agony is well displayed throughout the training sequences. In comparison to his performance in Rock On and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Akhtar was able to provide the audience with not only a character who seems believable, but also one that can inspire. Sonam Kapoors role was not as significant as one would expect based on the marketing of this film, however she serves a satisfactory performance and only takes up a short amount of screen time due to the nature of the films script. The interaction between young Milkha and his older sister, who is played by Divya Dutta provides the film with a sense of emotion unparalleled to any biopic in Bollywood history. Duttas performance greatly uplifts this films value and significantly portrays the true experiences that Milkha Singh witnessed throughout his life. The only performance that can be questioned in this film is Art Maliks portrayal of Milkha Singhs father. Throughout the scenes, his unfamiliarity with the Punjabi accent and lack of consistency can be seen which makes it evident to the audience that he is not a natural speaker of an Indian dialect. Despite this one flaw, the performances of this film push it to a much higher level than the average Bollywood works we see on a regular basis. As a whole, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag delivers to audiences across every culture. Unlike most films where a particular niche of viewers is targeted, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag universally generates interest by its idea of the struggle of the human spirit. Milkha Singhs struggles are able to emotionally reach out to viewers and gain their appreciation without making the plot line seem exaggerated. From its technical aspects to its complex script and screenplay, the film deserves to be Indias front runner for Best Foreign Film in the Academy Awards. Due to the films technical and aesthetic brilliance and the ability to entertain a universal audience, I give Bhaag Milkha Bhaag 10/10 stars. 
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag  A Flying Tale of A Flying Sikh	Karachi, Pakistan	A great movie experience is a combination of many things. It includes a convincing plot, high voltage drama, light moments that stay with viewers even when they leave the theatre, good music, inspirational elements and a few emotional scenes. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is among those movies which offer all the above mentioned ingredients at par. For those who keep a track of innovative, interesting and path breaking Indian Cinema the name of Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra is the symbol of excellence. Whenever he unfolded his sleeves, movies like Aks, Rang de Basanti and Delhi-6 were witnessed by cine-goers. All these movies are distinctive in one way or the other. BMB is nothing different than them. It is a master stroke  without a doubt. Farhan Akhtar secretes immense talent but no one has, up till Rakeysh Om Prakash, utilized that talent. Farhans directorial ventures Dil Chahta Hai and Lakshya made people realize his credibility as one of the finest directors. As an actor, BMB is his landmark. The way he has carried out his role and portrayed his emotions definitely demand standing ovation.BMB is based on the journey of great Indian athlete Milkha Singh (also known as Flying Sikh). It is a movie about a boy whose entire family excluding his elder sister was murdered in the riots of Indo-Pak partition and he became a national and international rage back in 1960s. It is also about the bond between a brother and sister  executed with exceptional detailing. Moreover, the movie is about a blooming romance, some promises with loved ones, emotional fits, flying high yet not leaving the ground by any means and a lot more. In short its about the life of Milkha Singh and what he went through.Performance wise, Farhan Akhtar deserves to be nominated for this movie especially by critics. He is a revelation in BMB. He tackles the most difficult parts with complete ease and effortlessness. His transitions can be easily witnessed and felt by the audience from first scene to the last. Divya Dutta as Milkha Singhs sister is vibrant, emotional, lovable and above all highly expressive. In 2 of the scenes particularly, she involved the audience to a level by her performance that no one could resist moistening their eyes. This is a performance she will always be reminded of. Sonam Kapoor (as Biro), Meesha Shafi (as Perizaad) and Rebecca Breeds (as Stella) had limited roles but they all performed well in their respective characters. Pavan Malhotra (as Milkha Singhs senior) is inspirational and at his peak. This actor is unfortunately most underrated, he needs to be casted in more movies to show-case his vast talent. Yograj Singh as (Milkha Singhs coach) is just perfect. Dalip Tahil is strictly passable and ditto for Dev Gill (Abdul Khaliq). Art Malik (as Milkha Singhs father) and Jabtej Singh (as young Milkha Singh) are credible and treat to watch.Music of this movie is amazing. Arif Lohars Bhaag Milkha, Sukhwinder Singhs Slow Motion Angrezza, Suhas Sawants Zinda and Divya Kumars Maston Ka Jhund are totally different from one another yet are really awesome tracks in all respects. Shankar-Ehsan-Loys music is simply amazing for this venture.Some sequences to lookout for  performance wise:When Farhan asks from where can he buy the Indian Teams blazer!When Divya Dutta meets young Milkha Singh in the camp.When Farhan insists Divya to wear his blazer  the scene would definitely bring tears to many viewers eyesWhen Farhan slaps himself repeatedly in the washroomand a lot moreOn the basis of performance, direction, execution and story-telling I would easily rate this movie 9/10. Its a must watch for those who celebrates quality and inspirational cinema. A must watch! 
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag  is a true inspirational movie for all us.	India	The man who create history with his hard work and passion SIR MILKHA SINGH..The movie is awesome.

Prasoon Joshi fully justice to script of the movie he actually done a great job with the story and presentation of movie is up to the mark.About MILKHA SINGH JI.He is a living legend and true inspiration for all of us. 
Best movie ever made	Australia	Trust me when I say this...BHAG MILKHA BHAG is the best movie I have ever ever watched. Not just amongst bollywood movies but it even beats any Hollywood movie ever made. For a movie based on a True life story I think this is a pretty hard thing to do..Every aspect of the movie is extreme and more beautiful than one can ever imagine.Romance, suffering, sadness, joy, excitement its got it all. So much respect for Sardar Milkha Singh ji for all his hard work and for all those people who endured what they endured during the partition of India and Pakistan 1947. Milkha Singh..Nobody could have played this role better than Farhan Akhtar...an absolute legend. His work in the movie is absolutely Mind blowing. His acting was so genuine I can not imagine there to be a person who wasnt moved. This movie absolutely touched my heart and shook me to my very core. I laughed, cried, got excited, nervous like I was there witnessing it all in real. Sardar Milkha Singh there SHOULD be a public holiday every year in your honor. And Farhan Akhtar..You Are An Absolute Legend. 
A biopic gets the Bollywood treatment in Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, which dramatizes the life of record-breaking Indian sprinter Milkha Singh, played by the talented Farhan Akhtar.	India	A handful of films sprint that extra mile beyond providing meager entertainment to its spectators. BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is one such cinematic experience. However, director Mehra and writer Prasoon Joshi encompass pertinent episodes/chapters from the icons life and create a film that makes you salute the sports-person, besides evoking the spirit of nationalism in the spectator. On the whole, BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is sure to win accolades, admiration, respect and esteem, besides emerging as a champ. In Bollywood movies, theres often an emphasis on more than the story, and filmmakers develop a keen sense for atmospherics. Along with some splendid music, director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra takes care with his shots, zooming in and using slow-motion to make a body traveling through a finish line, for example, look like art. 
The True Story of The Flying Sikh which became A Masterpiece of Indian Cinema	India	Bhag Milkha Bhag, the original story of The Flying Sikh, Milkha Singh is inspiring, fascinating, gripping, emotional, personal yet universal. The way Farhan Akhtar played the character is outstanding. But, not only Farhan Akhtar, but also Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (Director), Prasoon Joshi (Script-writer and Lyricist) and everybody has done a great job. The way, it pictured every detail of The Legends Life is unprecedented. And each important episode has given birth to a historical subplot. From featuring India-Pakistan partition to capturing the erase of the political borders, it is not mere a biopic of an Indian Athlete, who wins medals for India, but it became an epic and witnessed a turmoiled time-span through the eyes of Milkha Singh aesthetically and sensitively. The best part of the storyline is it showed beautifully that Milkha Singh never runs for medals. Instead, he runs for something else, something more personal, something beyond the competition titles. Sometimes he runs for a mug of milk, sometimes for the Indian Blazer, sometimes to forget his failure and overcome his weaknesses, sometimes to overcome his traumatized childhood. It showed how a sportsman can become an icon of a nation and how a legendary sportsman fights and wins his inner-battle simultaneously. It shows, how a Legend uses his nightmares, haunted memories, troubled grown-up times, failures, wounds and scars to make him more strong, more hard-working, more determined, more confident, more focused, more disciplined and more patriotic. It also showed that greatness is another name of politeness, humbleness, modesty and giving proper respect to all those seniors and gurus, who helped the man to become what he is today. The film interpreted Milkha Singhs life and achievements such a way, that it proved again the famous universal truth, It doesnt matter where you come from, it matters where you go. On-a-whole, Bhag Milkha Bhag is a masterpiece, a movie of a lifetime and a must watch for everyone. 
Can be watched again and again and again and will inspire every time	India	The movie might be over 3 hours long but there is never a dull moment. The first half of the movie starts on a light note but you can feel the simmered excitement lying beneath. Picks up pace after the intermission. It shows the transformation of Milkha Singh the underdog to Milkha Singh the champion. The background music fits superbly with the mood of the film. Can only say I was thoroughly spell-bounded. This movie is going to give running in India a boost. Hope more such movies are made in India which have some content, a emotional connect and give some life lessons but at the end you leave the hall on a high. Gem of a movie in a season of crappy mindless comedies. 
Strong story and motivational movie...	India	The movie starts with the Rome olympics. The movie switches between present and his childhood age for better continuation of story. Prakash Raj has done a good job though the time he appears in the screen is less he made his role get stitched to the audiences mind. Punjabi slang of Farhan is good. Director has tried to narrate the complete story of Milka singh in brief way. The scenes in the Indo-Pak games and Asian Championship deserves standing ovation. Cinematography is good. Sonam Kapoor has done pretty well. Behind the success of every man there might be a desire or a determination to prove a point. The way Milka Singh overcomes his hurdles in a positive way is motivational. Casting was done the best way. No unwanted roles . And all of them did their best of their roles.Always there will be some efforts put on by Farhan Akthar in his movies. He will be try to attract audience attention in the screen. This movie too is not exception to that. His hardwork in playing such a critical role gets rewarded when people give standing applause at the end. On the whole it is INCARNATION OF Farhan Akhtar as Flying Sikh. . 
Run to watch this now in 40.80 sec !!! thank you very much guys for making this movie...	India	really first of all I would like to thank Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra and Farhan for making this movie. really Farhan did not do any acting in this movie...acting Me Bhi Thoda Banaawatipan Aa Jata Hai..Sirji Unhone MILKA SINGH Ka Kirdaar Jiya Hai ....ultimate presentation totally flawless movie.very very very nice effort. This movie is exceptional, the best biography that i have ever witnessed at least in Bollywood!!just go..no no RUN and watch this movie .This movie has every ingredient required for a classic. Farhan Akhtar has left no stone unturned to bring life to Milkhas character...he talks n dances like a Sardar ,runs like an athlete, and when he runs...you are forced to say BRAVO.His FAAD body n conviction is worthy of an award. There r many high points n emotional moments (especially the race scenes) which add to d drama n strongly bind u with the protagonist. it is a 3 hrs 7 min long inspirational saga of motivation and dedication. DO NOT MISS it for any reason. Highly recommended 
Must watch if you think Bollywood can not produce great movies.	Guwahati, India	When I saw the trailer, I thought this biopic is going to be another Bollywood disaster. But when the positive reviews came from friends on social media, I decided to watch it. Before this I was neither fan of Farhan, nor Sonams but Rakeysh OP Mehra, I consider as great film-maker so I went for the night show at 10:30 PM assuming that I will be almost empty hall but surprisingly it was houseful and I got seat in 3rd row. IN first 15 minutes, I was sure these 3 hours are going to be ride with goosebumps, excitements. You can feel the pain of failure and happiness of each and every success of legendary Indian athlete Jeev Milkha Singh. Farhan is in so much of depth with this role that you will love it. It is a complete 3 hours treat which gives you a lot of lessons. That it is not easy to succeed. Just a moment can ruin all your efforts. 
Perfect Movie. Fantastic, Best Movie of Indian Industry.	Chandigarh	According to me this is the best movie of Indian Film Industry. So well directed , screen play , cinematography are up to mark. Now I have become a big fan of Farhan Akhtar, the movie shows his hard work and dedication. He is something super perfect. All actors performed with full zeal. Specially Divya Dutta she played the role of sister of Milkha Singh, she is a real actor. Salute to bath Farhan Akhtar And Divya Dutta...... Movie was something more than i can write. It will make you cry, laugh and inspired at all moments. Its shows the fine work done by these great artist. More Farhan and Sonam Kapoor took nothing for this tribute work. A big salute to them. And finally some words for the legend Milkha Singh. What he did 50 years ago is never achieved till date and will not be achieved 1000 years ago. He is a example of pure hard work and sportsmen. He has suffered a lot in his life , a normal person suffering from same situations can not even lead a normal life but what he did is only and only his sincere efforts and diligence . Really he is a Flying Sikh . He bought laurels to the country and to our society too. I am a great fan of him. May he prosper in his life. I would love to watch this movie a million times. 
Flawless Movie Bhaag Milkha Bhaag...!!!	Jamshedpur, India	Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is surely one of the best movies of Indian Cinema.. A perfect biopic made by the brilliant Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra...

Rakesh Omprakash Mehra raises the bar for Indian films	Dubai, United Arab Emirates	I will start off with the technicals first and whats better than to start off with the editing. PS Bharati has the most short yet one of the most impressive resumes ever. The editing was immaculate. A huge number of Bollywood films fail to edit simple linear stories in a way that the editing doesnt interfere with storytelling. Bhaag Milkha Bhaags on-screen presentation was non-linear and at no point do you feel lost. The editing was so precise that you know exactly which era of the story you are being told.Next, the sound-mixing and score. From the moment the film begins and you hear the background score for the first time, you automatically associate it to an epic saga which will unfold before you momentarily. And it does. The original score by SLE in association with the sound mixing department just blended together so well. SLEs score could have done well on its own, but I think the mixing department gave it the treatment it deserved.Lets now divert the focus to Binod Pradhan (pun totally intended). This man has proved his genius before and he held no bars this time either. He knew exactly where to point the camera and at what angles. Often times Ive noticed cinematographers simply point the camera lens to an impressive landscape to showcase their prowess as a cinematographer. Selecting the landscape and the equipment is just the start, what you do with that is a different ball game altogether. Binod Pradhan captured the subtle nuances of Farhan Akhtar with such detail, that you dont even need verbal verification of whats going on in the characters mind. And ROM did an excellent job of keeping it that way rather than dumbing it down and explaining everything that was running through (yes, another pun) Milkhas mind. Binod knew exactly what element had what importance in each scene and managed to capture them with utmost sincerity.As a writer, Prasoon Joshi hasnt yet marked his territory until now. With just this one script, he has proved that he is capable of joining the big guns of the Indian film industry. I hope this isnt his one-hit- wonder. One things for sure, I will certainly be very excited for a movie which Prasoon Joshi pens.The acting. It goes without saying that Farhan Akhtar wasnt Farhan Akhtar in the movie. He was Milkha Singh. I had my reservations about Farhan Akhtar, since I thought he might bring in that element into the character that would seem a little over fetched. Like his additional humor which might only prove to distract rather than entertain. But Farhan Akhtar showed such grace and resilience by overcoming his one minor (very minor) quip and embodied the character in a way which I believe no one else could. He deserves recognition for this movie far beyond what is already provided to him. He made us care about Milkha Singh and his family. He made us care about running. He made us care about our nation. What Milkha Singh actually went through in his real life was nothing short of a living and brooding hell. He not only fought his past, but he carved out a path for himself that would allow all Indians the fortune of raising their heads high. And we lived part of it through Farhan Akhtar.From Dalip Tahil to Yograj Singh to Meesha Shafi; everyone did true justice to the roles they had to portray. None of the casting seemed out of place.I think that provides me the perfect segue to talk about the man behind it all - Rakesh Omprakash Mehra. It was his job to gather everything I mentioned in my review above and present it to the viewer. He went above and beyond his duty to narrate a tale of romance, heartbreak, the will to achieve, and inspire. The storytelling was a stroke of genius. A movie that could just as well be another inspiring story about a man who led India to glory was not just that. It was an insight into the character that ROM crafted. Im saying that because not all events depicted in the film were actual. This is exactly the reason I labeled the storytelling as genius. ROM took an already inspiring life-story, added a little filmmaking magic and presented something that only a genius filmmaker could present. ROM doesnt claim the story to be an exact re-telling of Milkha Singhs life and this is what the viewer should expect when ROM mentions that its inspired by a true life-story and not based on true life-story. He knew exactly how and when to trap into the viewers emotional side and when to play the humour card, for instance. ROM successfully managed to convert the entire cinema hall into a roller-coaster that takes you through the tragic, and yet prominently successful story of Milkha Singh, one of the nations truest heroes. ROM not only used the tools he was provided to tell a story, but he contributed an offering that would raise the bar of what is expected of a good film in the future. I can only hope that ROM receives all the appreciation he so rightfully deserves for the masterpiece that is Bhaag Milkha Bhaag. 
Hard Work willpower and Dedication, Bhag Milkha Bhag	India	Not I only watched. I felt this movie. It has been a wonderful time to watch this movie. What a class movie. All the character were doing justice with their role. And I salute to you Farhan you have done it very commendable role with a great dedication.I could not move in the whole movie, every scene was describing a complete story. Even there are so many heart touching scene, tears were in my eyes.I was shouting when Milkha Singh was winning the race. Sir Milkha Singh, you are real hero who had made a great effort with superb dedication. Movie is amazing, It is worth to watch it. And for you Sir Milkha Singh, I salute from bottom of my heart, A great athlete ( A great Flying Sikh) 
Epic movie	mumbai	Wooow !!! A lifetime movie. Direction: Rakyesh did justice to his work and his crew. Three phases of a person life going simultaneously was just too good. He is master in his art. He did same in RANG DE BASANTI. Cast:Each and every character who might have been on screen for a time of 30-50 second also played such an important role. No one was left unnoticed . Every one made their presence to be felt on screen . Music: Heavy background music but that will not let you lose focus from movie. Just enough to pump the adrenalin. Script: A biopic only could not be enough for audience. The script had all the magic and Prasoon Joshi nailed it. Farhan Akhtar :HE JUST BLEW EVERYONE . Totally outstanding .A must watch . Few things are to be experience not just to be known.MILKHA SINGH : This man is SUPER HERO from India . TRIBUTE to the legend!!! 
An extra ordinary journey of an ordinary person	Mumbai, India	Director Mr. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra deserves a standing ovation for selecting and justifying this biopic of Milkha Singh. This type of movie can inspire a generation. Director was so indulged in the film that rather making a film he was just living it. His approach towards every scene is very balanced. Movie length is 3.20 hours but you wont regret for spending this much of time. Even, you enter in film with biased opinion to hate it, slowly movie opens it arms to embrace you and eventually you have to fall in love with it. Screenplay and dialogues by Prasoon Joshi is too good. He has given minute details of the characters very well. When, Milkha Singh prior coaches come to convince him to go to Pakistan, that time he was a rich person, his servant comes with the tea tray but he prefers to make tea by himself and he knows well that how much sugar his coaches prefer. This scene reflects his modesty, honesty and respect without speaking a word. There are so many scenes of this caliber. Dialogues are very balanced, sweet and inspiring. Few of them are  Unche Udne Wale Parindon Ko Chhote Chhote Darakhton Se Dil Nahi Lagana Chahiye......Main Aapki insult nahi kar raha hun ji, Bas Khud Se Lad Raha Hun...Wahan KI hawa Mein Mere Apno Ke Khoon Mile Hue Hain, main unme sans nahi le paunga. There was least scope for humor but it is blended with right intensity at right place. Performance wise Farhan Akhter is mesmerizing. This is not acting; it is simply transforming yourself in to the character. Simply awesome. The boy who played, young Milka Singh is amazing. He looks so innocent and fierce. Sonam Kapoor looks adorable. Divya Datta is mind blowing. She can make your eyes moist so many times, with her expression only, without speaking words. Pawan Malhotra as his first coach is very good. Prakash Raji is fine. Music by Sankar Ehsan Loy is completely blended with mood of film. It gives proper pace to film when it requires. This type of films make me proud to be part of this industry. Hats off to complete team of this film. 
Run Run Run!	singapore	As I lifted my aching bums from the seat after watching this film the uppermost thought in my mind was a silent thank you to the guardian angels of cinema.After all if this is how we approach biopics I am so happy that Gandhi was made by a foreigner 30 years ago.If Bollywood had a shot at it, they would have made the Mahatma do garba and dandiya with Kasturba and his brave experiments with celibacy would have turned to sleaze.There would have been Zulu dancers during his South Africa phase, soulful ghazals when he visits Amritsar in the aftermath of Jalianwala Baag massacre and sufi songs when Hindu Muslim riots break out.There would also have been some Englishman raping a Indian girl and a sexy mujra in the court of a debauched Maharaja.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag tries to tell the story of Indias greatest athlete in the only language that Bollywood understands  the musical.Indeed a sporty musical can be done very well as Lagaan demonstrated but this film simply does not have the material to carry off a handful of songs.It all begins at the Rome Olympics in 1960 where Milkha Singh comes fourth in a photo-finish despite being the world record holder and a favorite to win the race.The reason for his poor showing is a backward glance which according to the film is the massacre of his family during the partition coming back to haunt him.Nothing is further from the truth. Milkha Singh lost because he made a strategic blunder in running too fast during the first 250 meters and tried to slow down which cost him the race.That and his being in lane 5 which creates a blind spot and a disadvantage for a sprinter.So much for a biopic!The film ends with a cricket match final.Now how can that be since this film is about athletics? I am lying of course, the director wisely reduces his race in Pakistan to a India Pakistan war as it happens in every Indo-Pak cricket match and ends the film on a jingoistic note! And yes we take a full three hours to reach this convoluted climax.The story of Milkha Singh is a great story, his lost childhood, his parents murder during the partition, his rise to running glory, his infamous loss at the Rome Olympics which led to him hitting the bottle, his win in Pakistan and him turning down the Arjuna Award.But Mr Mehra finds it more important to dwell on his romance while growing up and his one night stand with a hot Australian girl during the Melbourne Olympics.A chiseled Farhan doing push ups at the beach with a buxum bikini clad blond lying on his back should be paisa wasool!To the films credit the races are filmed with great finesse, the training sequences are epic, Farhan Akthar has a body to die for or to kill for and some of the incidents of his early life are very engrossing. Undoubtedly Farhan as Milkha is a casting coup and the effort he puts into becoming Milkha Singh translates into a superlative performance.The big budget is up on the screen, the attention to period detail is exquisite and Binod Pradhans camera-work top notch. Pawan Malhotra is downright brilliant as his coach.There is this shot when Milkha Singh get taken over by the coach of the national team and Pawan Malhotra looks at him with an expression that is a mixture of pride and sadness, he is loosing his most talented protge and is happy for him.That shot alone redeems this film.Bhaag Milkha Bhag is a stellar example of a wasted opportunity, this could have been a good film if 70 minutes had been chopped and it could have been a great film if it had focused on Milkha Singh the man and athlete and not on Farhan Akhtar the alpha male with the body of a Greek God.Even after three hours of watching this film we are none the wiser about the profession of running or what it must have been like to be Milkha Singh in the first decade of Indias independence or what the legacy of this great athlete is.Bhaag Audience Bhaag! 
new by standards of Indian sports movies but falls short of a classic	India	BHAAG MILKHA BHAAG is a biopic based on the life of most celebrated athlete of India. It is directed by RAKEYSH OMAPRAKSH MEHRA who is looking to make a good film after failure of Delhi 6. MILKHA SINGH is played by talented and versatile FARHAN AKHTAR. In India, sports movie begin with a child seeing dream to be successful and in last scene he hits six or scores a goal but mind you, this is different. For that credit must go to wonderful editing. Movie is 3 hour long but does not look boring, even songs have been used quite brilliantly. FARHAN AKHTAR shows his acting skills and his hard work is noticeable in the movie. This may be considered exaggeration by some but I think he resembled Daniel day Lewis. Just like DDL you would think that this is MILKHA SINGH not FARHAN. This is really commendable. SONAM KAPOOR is really brilliant in the short role she got, she may not have pr of other actress so she might not get much appreciation but still she was brilliant in little role she has. Cast has done brilliant job, PAVAN MALHOTRA and YOGRAJ SINGH have given strong performance. And yes YOGRAJ SINGH is father of YUVRAJ SINGH just for info. In technical departments movie is good. Cinematography is good suitable for a period film. Music is really good. Every song is suitable for respective situations. SHANKAR EHSAAN LOY shows that they are still one of the best music director around in industry. Editing as mentioned is excellent. Talking about weak points of the movie, which stops this movie at being good and not classic. Some parts are fictional and take the seriousness out. Like the sequence of him drinking 2 kg of Desi ghee however entertaining, but does not look good. Second thing is I have good knowledge of sports and I knew history of his life. So after interval, it becomes predictable. But this may not be a problem as most in India do not know him that well. Third and biggest flaw is MILKHA SINGH never held the world record but this thing is given much importance in movie and it shows he breaks the world record. Other than these technical faults, this movie is really wonderful and must watch. Do not miss it. No wonder why athlete great Carl Lewis called him to congratulate him for a wonderful career. 
A laudable achievement in inspirational cinema	United States	Sprinting through the 400m track, Milkha Singh flies with a dream to win glory, with purpose to shine for his country and reason, to overcome his weakness. Honed by expert coaches and disciplined by the Army, Milkha Singh achieves what no athlete could with his background. The finest visionary filmmaker, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra (R.O.M) introduces Milkhas childhood to delineate the events and circumstances that made the orphaned refugee a world class athlete. The inspiring real life story is nothing short of epic on the cinema screen with Farhan Akhtar, embodying a soulful portrayal of R.O.Ms envisioned protagonist. The parallel storytelling smoothly transitions between the humble beginnings of young Milkha, the events of partition that led to him taking refuge in Delhis camps and his rebellion against his circumstances that made his coal-blackened hands hold the Indian Armys guns.It wasnt until he went through rigorous training and transformation to fight his inner demons to overcome his horrifying past, that we see Milkhas ultimate success and recognition as the Flying Sikh. It all begins with the race at the Roman Olympics when Milkha Singh failed to clench victory. A distraught Milkha has the opportunity for reclaiming glory in Pakistan, where his original home and memories remain. Partition drove Milkha to the refugee camp in Delhi where he reunited with his sister, only to run away from his circumstances to liberation. Love takes over Milkhas life with the innocent Biro charming her way into his heart. But Milkhas inability to find a respectable livelihood separates him from his love with a newfound ambition. The Indian Army is where he learns about respect and a cross-country trial was where his talent was recognized. While being completely dedicated to running, his affair with an Aussie girl prior to the Melbourne Olympics distracted him from the cause and he failed to qualify. Disappointed with himself, Farhan portrays the raw emotion with punishment in front of the mirror. His next goal is to break the 400m world record and when the aims are that high, so are the training grounds. R.O.M has showcased Ladakh in all its desolate beauty. Farhans painstakingly developed brawn is that of an athlete and one has to applaud his genuine effort. Over time, Milkha Singh achieves success on the track and unimaginable glory for the nation. With renewed focus and nothing to distract him from running to the finish line, Milkha attains the title of the Flying Sikh with his epic victory.Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has brilliantly visualized an inspiring story of the legend, of course adding his own dramatic elements, and given us a masterpiece to live by. In familiar styling of setting distinct color tones for flashbacks and using ultra-slow motion photography, he greatly enhances the visual feel of several important scenes. Farhan Akhtar had spent days with the living legend, understanding his character while transforming his physique to appear athletic. His dedication to the character and his own contribution to its depiction are truly remarkable feats because you do see him as Milkha Singh and not Farhan Akhtar. Such a performance is to be cherished and must hail accolades at ceremonies. Sonam Kapoor in a brief role as Biro is charming and vital to the storys evolution. Japtej Singh as young Milkha is versatile with his emotions and has a good understanding of the characters circumstances. Divya Dutta is a great talent and has been used wisely by Mehra to bring an emotional balance in Milkhas life. Yograj Singh as National team Coach Ranvir Singh is simply outstanding as Milkhas progressive mentor. Perhaps the most heartfelt and genuine performance is of Pawan Malhotra as coach Gurudev Singh. His emotions are keenly felt and as exemplary an actor as he is, one must appreciate Mehras casting that brought the best out of him. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loys return after a lull period justifies the time spent in creating the score for this film. From the uplifting background score to the petulant theme of Gurbaani that is enhanced by Daler Mehendis passionate vocals, the trio have variety and pertinence for the films subject. While Mera Yaar, Rangrez, Slow-motion angreza are tracks that could be edited to make the film tighter, they are still melodious tracks to listen to. Arif Lohars Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a subtle anthem for his training in Ladakh but its effect is definitely uplifting. The rock version by Siddharth Mahadevan is inspiring and suited to the end credits. Maston ka jhund is catchy, fun and similar to Khalbalee in its effect. But the films best track is the powerful Zinda that catches the spirit of Milkha Singh. Its the song that works while passing cars on the highway, in the gym, bathroom, while running or even jumping over train compartments. Rakeysh Mehra has adroitly used technologies to enhance the films emotional feel. Milkhas feet running over sands, him running over train compartments and crossing the finish line in slow motion are visuals that one cannot erase from the mind. He captures the essence of the dedicated athlete for whom running meant more than just a sport. It gave purpose to his life. Prasoon Joshis writing is yet again commendable and has more impact when visualized by Rakeysh Mehra. The hard work put in by everyone in the film is apparent in its realistic depiction. The sincerity is keenly felt and the passionate portrayal of Milkha Singh is warmly embraced. There might be a song too many and a sequence or two prolonged, but Milkha Singhs story is an important one nevertheless because it reminds us that there are no shortcuts to success. It comes at the cost of sacrifices, buckets of sweat and ounces of blood in its journey. - 9.488 on a scale of 1-10.

Had Great time watching this Excellent Movie	Chandigarh	The whole story line revolving around life of milkha singh is beautifully portrayed. All the characters belonging to milkha singh is shown with utmost justice. Character of milkha singh sister ishri is amazingly played by divya dutta. These types of movies are not usual in Bollywood as every time a typical Bollywood movies contains masala, action, comedy but nothing to inspire the youth, but this movies plays a significant role in uplifting the standard of Bollywood movies as well as portraying milkha singh as a role model for todays youngsters. Everyone in his life must go and see this movie. As far as flaws are concerned nothing is perfect, you can always pin point deficiencies in some of most popular and great movies ever made in Hollywood. So rather than being negative please go and watch this movies and also dont forget to bring your kids with you. surely theyll learn something.... :) 
Excellent(a bit too long)	India	I dont really do this but Id like to make an exception in this case. The movie is excellent. Great way of story telling. The story is about one man but he is not the only one who plays the role exceedingly well. After watching this I dont think any one who acted in this film was remotely bad. They all acted amazingly well and gave true justice to their own characters. Only drawback that i can mention here is the time. i think the movie is a bit too long. For the first 2 and half hours i didnt really feel the need to look at my watch.Overall a refreshing film with excellent story and great acting. 
A hardworking Team	Mumbai	I personally feel like the team has worked hard for all that scenes and captured that in so nice way. Film is so inspirational and will definitely motivate you. I will congratulate child milk ha(Master Jabtej Singh) for his tremendous work.Faran has worked out like anything to get this shape. Dialogues are perfect and on time. The side characters are so entertaining. Cinematography and Screenplay both are high standard.You can find some advantages of India Army. Also this film reflects some India Pakistan history. It gives a moral at the end of the show. So for all go and have a taste of thisgood work. Salute for Flying Shikh. 
Ispiring without being unhealthy or boring ,Have the GRIT to run a marathon	London	Best movie by far as compared to any other Indian Movies , No awkward scenes ,Everything fits so perfectly that you stop feeling that it is movie .The character makes you alive. Farhan Akhtars acting is up there .This movie will take Indian cinema to new heights.Must watch for young people .Ispiring without being unhealthy or boring. The movie challenges you ,Farhan Akhtar is a purist and the movie will have long lasting effect on people . I have seen another movie after Bhag Milkha Bhag and it felt like the other movie was the work of a parasite. The other movie was Fer Mamla Gadbad Gadbad. I wanted to leave the cinema after first 10 mins.Must watch . 
Do not walk ... RUN to Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!	United States	An extraordinary film.In one sense a biopic of a real historical person  Milkha Singh, The Flying Sikh, the orphaned emigr (from the terrible Partition riots that followed the creation of independent Pakistan and India in 1947) who rose to become Indias first world-record setting athlete  this movie gives its audience so MUCH more, in so many ways.On an individual level, the Hindi film Bhaag Milkha Bhaag (2013) takes over from the Stallone classic Rocky (1976) as a great sport-based triumph of the human spirit story. Yet at a global level this film also succeeds as one of the best movies yet made about the Partition, which inspires much-needed emotional healing for both nations. Many countries, actually, could benefit from this films message.(The title  Run Milkha Run, in English  were Milkhas fathers final words.)Farhan Akhtar  phenomenal!Mr Akhtars mindblowing performance here as the title character will make you forget, for a time, that he is also one of Indias best directors. (And a producer. And writer. And lyricist. And singer. None of which hats he wears here.) Bhaag Milkha Bhaag proves that Farhan Akhtar, at 39, has matured into one of the worlds finest living ACTORS.He has brought the same honesty, subtlety, and power to this role, as an actor, which audiences have come to expect as a trademark of the films he directs or produces. Mr Akhtar engages you completely, from the opening frame to the last. You will laugh. You will cry. You will think. You will feel inspired to fly.Bhaag Milkha Bhaag soars on the wings of Farhan Akhtars performance.The sheer  physicality  deserves special appreciation. It is no easy thing, for any mere actor to physically embody a career athlete. Mr Akhtar reportedly conditioned and trained for 18 months, to transform his body and his whole manner of movement. The result is on the screen: you will believe you are watching a world champion runner.Its an extra plus that Mr Akhtar, the actor, does so strongly resemble the real Milkha Singh  in build, body type, and the bones of the face  as the historic photographs shown over the end credits clearly reveal.The supporting cast are uniformly excellent, but I single out these four for special notice.Veteran character actor Pavan Malhotra gives a career-breakthrough performance as Gurudev Singh, the army coach who first introduced young Milkha Singh to competitive running. He becomes the audience point-of-access to Milkhas whole backstory.UK-based Pakistani-born actor Art Malik receives  and earns  third star billing, despite limited minutes. As Milkha Singhs father, his character is long dead and only appears in the 1947 flashback sequences. But Mr Malik so deftly projects an intriguing multi-dimensional character that his image, his presence, linger in the mind long after he has faded from the screen.Divya Dutta as Ishri Kaur, Milkhas sole surviving sister. Brilliant! Emotional touchpoint for the whole audience, on both the individual and societal levels.Last but certainly not least: newcomer Japtej Singh, who plays Milkha as a child. Merges perfectly with Mr Akhtar as the adult Milkha; you believe one would grow into the other. Most natural and genuine performance by any child actor that I had seen in years. (May this be the beginning of a long and great career for young Mr Singh!)Chief among technical departments, the strong story structure of Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a huge plus. The filmmakers chose an unusual starting point to begin telling their story: what might be thought the greatest failure of Milkha Singhs career. (Breaking his own world record, but only finishing 4th  out of the medals  in the 400 meter run at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome.) But through deft intercutting between the then-present and selected flashbacks to Milkhas backstory, the film builds to an unexpectedly powerful climax that emotionally satisfies while inspiring on both personal and global levels.Special credit: without diluting the emotional horror of Milkhas childhood experiences during the Partition, visual horror is kept to a minimum. A very difficult balance to keep, but successfully achieved here. (Note to Parents: film does contain one disturbing image of an athletics injury.)The taut script by Prasoon Joshi and crisp editing by P. S. Bharathi elevate Bhaag Milkha Bhaag by an order of magnitude above director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehras earlier movies (such as Rang De Basanti (2006) which, though fresh and original, was comparatively unfocused and sprawling in its storytelling technique). Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, by comparison, is so tightly written and well paced that I never even noticed the three-hour length, the film runs so fast and so smoothly.The music  by Shankar Ehsaan Loy  is so good, so inspiring, that I rushed straight out to buy the soundtrack music CD immediately after leaving the movie!Pretty easily, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is THE BEST film Ive seen from anywhere in the world thus far in 2013. (This statement includes the Oscar holdovers from year 2012.) Will prove to be a landmark film in world cinema. 
Runner , Runner	Mumbai, India	Milkha Singh , the name many youngsters dont give a damn about . A country with nearly 1.3 billion population where almost every other boy dreams to be playing cricket , how can they remember this legend. But Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra has changed the scenario. With the actor Farhan Akhtar with his side, this movie truly triumphs.The story of super-sprinter Milkha Singh unfolds in this exceptional biopic at its own volition. Theres no effort here to tell a story, to create an impression or to whip up a dramatic storm to captivate audiences. The synergy in the storytelling seems subliminal From the trailers we have seen that how much Farhan has given for his physique. He has done excellent job , probably he may claim the National Award for his acting. The multi talented guy who has already shown his acting capabilities simply makes you say WOW when you see him in this flick. And he gets tremendous support from other actors, specially Divya Dutta, who is incomparably sincere in her role. Pavan Malhotra as Milkhas coach is as usual, first-rate.With immense help from Prasoon Joshi, Mehra harnesses Milkhas life-story into an experience that is pure cinema and yet undiluted and uncompromised by the mandatory, often silly, illogical and idiotic semantics of mainstream commercial cinema.In Prasoon Joshis interpretation of Milkhas amazing success-story, yearning is the cornerstone to achievement. In 1947, when India became two nations, we see little Milkha (Jabtej Singh) run for his life to escape the savage butchery that snatches away almost his entire family. Only his dear sister, played wonderfully by Divya Dutta, remains. As we see it, Milkha never stopped running since the partition trauma.The run as a metaphor of lifes expedient circumstances, runs through the narrative.Happily, the screen time is as much taken up with Milkhas record-breaking achievements on the field, as it is with vignettes from his personal life. There is a robust heartwarming romance between Milkha and the vessel-friendly kudi Biro (Sonam Kapoor, looking prettier than ever). The writer and director invest inexpressible warmth in the protagonists courtship scenes. Weve seen this kind of love blossom on Punjabs soil before. But it still feels special and unique.I have never seen Milkha Singh running but when you see Farhan on the screen you can easily say that he is not faking. He has immersed himself deep down in the athletic spirit. When he runs, he really runs. When he stumbles and takes a fall, we flinch and wince in our seats. Farhans body language and emotions and expression as Milkha is pitch-perfect.I have never thought that a biographical movie can be such interesting till I saw this and Paan Singh Tomar. While you are on-the-run, pause to watch this one. Go run and see this epic! 
An epic biopic	India	A wonderful cinematic recreation of history!Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra knows just how much to add of each ingredient - drama, comedy, and of course the true story of the legendary Flying Sikh - to keep this within the realms of a film and yet transcend the boundaries of movie-making. He makes you realize the struggles and the horror Milkha Singh had to overcome in his journey to become what he is today. He makes you feel for Milkha Singh like a fellow human being, a man with feelings and flaws of his own. He makes you root for the man to succeed and celebrate with him when he does.And of course, Mehras portrayal of Milkha Singh probably wouldnt have been half as believable if it werent for Farhan Akhtars outstanding performance. Maybe his character was in reel, but his perspiration was definitely real. 10/10! 
Perfection at its finest!	India	Its been a long time since I have watched a Hindi movie and got goosebumps let alone sitting at the edge of my seat. I will be honest, my expectation before going for the movie were not too high! But from the time the movie began, every frame of the movie was perfect. Details in the video - dont miss the part where Milka runs for qualification run in India. Narration of the movie was awesome, usually the story writer makes it very confusing especially when there are flash backs within flash back. Music was just right, it wasnt off the scene at any point. If you assumed that there will be plenty of national anthem / patriotic music playing at every given point then you would be wrong.Songs are not amiss, it is webbed into the scenes. (No, the hero wont wake up in London with the actresss dupatta) And best of all what I liked in this movie is that there is no scene which abruptly goes into a song or black out! They have dealt with all the emotions very well. This is one of those movies where at the end you would want to stand up and applaud.

Milka Singh such an inspiration	United States	Beautiful. This was so emotionally moving. This reminded me of my brother and his difficult challenges and how much he has overcome them. I have truly been moved,educated, inspired, and won over by this movie. This was a success and a true inspiration for many things in life. I solute all the people who contributed. Milka Singh took little to no money like actress Sonam Kooper for this movie. It shows how great this movies message was.This was above and beyond even Slum Dog millionaire or even Jodha Akbar because of its value to our younger generation. It will inspire many people to overcome barriers so to pursue a better future for themselves. 
Great movie, humor and inspiration	USA	One of the best (Top 5 in world) movie maker, actor and talent that is Farahn Akhtar and this is movie is one of my favs. I have been captivated by his movies so much I just cant express. awesome mind blogging motivation inspiration Farans body is the best right now in Bollywood Great Movie! Hes one unbelievable guy alive - talented, hard working and great looking guy! He can take a simple act of life and make it so gloririous. His dad romanticized acts with words and this guy his son is able to romanticize the smallest thing in the world. Its so unbeleievble how mind can expand on hard work and then create unbelievable things. I want to thank this guy for such greatness! 
Grand Salute to the Flying Sikh	India	The movie Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is not only a story of Milkha Singh but it is a motivation for all those who give up at times when there is no hope at all. There are times when we lose hope and get down on our knees but Milkha Singh did the opposite to prove that he is a kind of person who would fight out all the things to make himself a LEGEND of all times. It is a fact that he could not get his love but because of that love only he is today known by the name Flying SIKH. Grand Salute to the man who proved his words and earned the BLAZER of team India. Milkha Singh made his lifetime achievements winning 77 races out of the 80 he ran. The one which no one can forget is the Olympics race of 1960 in which he saw behind. The moment he saw behind the GOLD medal was gone. It was hard day for all the Indians but he never made the same mistake again ever.
