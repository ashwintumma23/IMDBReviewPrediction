Celebrate your Freedom ...	India	Paint It Yellow. Oops.that's suppose to be Rang De Basanti.. Well that's exactly the director tries to convey. Its about today, us and our present, yet the similarities we have from the Pre-independence era. The Gen-x who knows Mac-D but still prefers the Dhaba Paranthas with sweet Lassi. However they restrict their national values only to food and nothing more. Its not a run of the mill stuff with 6 six romantic songs, couple of foreign locales and then finally some emotional drama.. No no no.. Rang Deis a Cult movie. It is more of an introspection, a food for our thought process. It makes us think, as to how should we actually celebrate our freedom. I was really moved by some of the ending lines by the narrator, I thought there are 2 types of people in the world, one who die crying and other who move away in silence but today I learned there is third genre, people who go laughing. That says it all Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast. However veterans like Om Puri and Anupam Kher looked disposed. All the characters grow gradually in the film and make you think their way. Everyone is given enough space to justify their talent. Rakesh Omprakash Mehra is a director of the new emerging Indian cinema, he always tries to bring in something very different. I was really impressed by his last attempt in 2001 for Aks (Amitabh Bachchan and Manoj Bajpai ), and he definitely has succeeded in making another fabulous master piece. The highlight of the movie is the great use of cinematography techniques. Its probably for the first time in Indian cinema that juxtaposing has been used with such a great effect. The way each character gradually immerses into scenes from the past leaves you fantasizing about the hard work that has gone in the background to create this, both technically and on the part of the actor.The movie starts on a very high spirit reflecting today's youth mindset who believe that patriotism is something that looks good in history chapters and today's world is far ahead of all that, they would prefer to go boozing and dancing rather than thinking on any of those lines. The way the campus scenes are shown really makes everyone go down the memory lanes of beautiful college days. This is followed by some intriguing drama and events which turns the life of a group of buddies upside-down altogether.The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in one's own way. A.R. Rehman doesn't need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country.The brilliance of Aamir Khan is something very difficult to narrate, he has proved it umpteen number of times that he is truly the most versatile actor in the industry. His comic timing in the first part is better than anything seen in recent past. He is extremely fluent even with difficult Punjabi tongue twisters and the acting prowess he has shown would be very difficult to match by anyone around. He appears so natural and his complete look with new hairstyle (which is now part of his every new movie) gives a very striking combination.Well the most wanting part of the whole thing has been the script to certain extent, it appears very loose in the second half and at times gives a droning feel. Few new ideas presented by the author looked half-baked. However it has been the technical expertise of the director who managed to save the things with some outstanding camera work and editing.Rang De  is for sure a must watch movie, it doesn't have any preaching but still it will force you to think once. As they say it There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them. I believe most of us want to bring about the changes without doing anything, so its time to think again folks and take some responsibility, lets Paint It Yellow  
A  must see for young India	Mumbai, India	The movie released today after a lot of hype and controversies. I went to see it expecting it to be a little different from the standard escapist fantasies churned out by the Indian film industry (of which I am not a fan). What I got was something so very different from what I had envisioned. The humor,the clich&eacute;s, the nonchalance of youth, the culture, religion,politics... are all there and the best part is that it works. The storyline though is stretched a bit (we Indians need that) but the message is loud and clear. Throughout the movie a great sense of humor is maintained.The performances are all excellent. I have given this movie a rating of 10 solely on the basis of the originality of the story. While this movie is definitely not Kurasawa or Satyajit Ray, it is one of the few movies from India which I feel will appeal to both the mainstream and discerning audiences. A movie not to be missed. 
No words ...simply best	India	all the people who are waiting for good, original and well executed Indian film . the wait is over for you people. Go and watch this movie. i wont tell you anything about the story. from direction to screenplay, dialog's and all other parts in technical sections extraordinary work done by all. the performances of every actor are mind blowing. don't miss this movie. its worth watching. the use of flashback to show the historical scenes, very fine use of cinematography and art direction to show the difference between past and present India. its a journey of boys from college students to the fiery,rebels. No wonder... it gives you real life look.. 
At Last	United States	It's about time there has been a Bollywood film about the youth of India. Granted these are college kids and not the average Indian adolescent who sometimes foresakes education for work, they are a good representatives of young Indians both in the diaspora and in India.Casting is great. Each character pursues their emotion, when their emotions are pursued by circumstances. They express both the emotions at surface and those sunken to be brought out by a situational tide. And they do it with truthfulness. Although some of the elder cast could have been utilized more, the focus on the youth and parallels with past figures are well orchestrated. The character that plays Bhagat Singh, Amir Khan, and Sonia are incredible. Each has their own spotlight where they nudge us from complacency and create an unstable sense of urgency.This is the best screenplay I have seen thus far in Indian media. Although BLACK had great language through what we saw on the screen, this movie has shown the progress of film- making abroad. Finally! The depth and character development we need are supplied with not just turn of events, but the turn of the screen. We don't need just words to understand a character. This movie shows how well a change in scene isn't a transition but an entity that holds together a character and emotion. And repetition! And repetition of words, dialogue, and attitude through the parallels was very inspiring.The general storyline of the movie is good. I say good because parts of the youth's leisure sometimes can get annoying as well as the camera-work that accompanies it. At times I wanted to push the film forward and get to the point. But that's the point! Point being that we need to understand the choppy nature of the first half because, chops or not, these characters are transient figures who don't realize their role in life until they have experienced the wholeness of reality. It's interesting that the wholeness comes from reflections of the past. The use and reuse of certain scenes are important in showing the character growth built upon experience.AR Rahman's music captures the reality unbelievably. We have dance numbers, but they're pathetic belligerent kicking and hand waving. Isn't that what we usually do when we're drunk anyways? Although the use of the music is off sometimes and abrupt, the emotion that each peace carries relates so well to the circumstances. The best use, in my opinion, being Luka Chuppi by Lata M and AR Rahman. The symbiosis between the lyrics and the events on screen are incredible. Dramatic irony at it's best.The cinematography of this film is great in the majority of the film. The few annoyances in cinematography come with the patchy scenes with the first half during these leisure rides and early in the second half. But, besides that - the cinematographer and director have made outstanding use of the diagonal view. The lines and profiles of people and country are so well placed that you begin to understand how crooked life's path can be. None of us have a straight line ahead of us. What makes me enjoy the movie the most is the humor and cause. You'd think with all the aforementioned details that this is a sobering movie about crooked lives and emotions and such, but the characters have fun. Sue's project is hilarious and the use of extras was really earnest. It is very much how I would be acting with friends, of course only when drunk like they are in certain parts. The cause is very important to this film and it makes it a powerful film because it has this cause.I'm 22. I just recently visited India. I understood and was confused by the youth of India and this film portrays the ambiguity of India well. There are no answers, there are only actions. And this is what they strive to do in the film. Usually Bollywood movies lose their purpose come the 1st dance number, but the truth of this film speaks more than numbers. It is a film about what comes after pure, white innocence of our youth. And it asks that we paint the difference. 
More Than A Wake-up Call, A Thought Provoking Movie For Our Times	United States	If I wait any more to say all the things I want to say about this great soul-stirring movie I will never be able to say it.It is the best use of the film medium that I have seen in a long long time.Here in the west we have virtually abandoned good cinema.Where are our Capras,our Wilders, our Hitchcocks, our David Leans? We make trivia now that neither entertain nor enlighten.To put it very bluntly, we make utter trash.Good work in the world is being done elsewhere, especially in India where a Bhansali stretches the limits of cinematic expression, where a new Wilder emerges in the shape of Anees Bazmee, where Shaad Ali springs a surprise with a Bunty Aur Bubbly,where out of nowhere comes a Guru Dutt in the garb of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and takes us to a new level of awareness and self-discovery through cinema in a stunning masterpiece called Rang De Basanti.I challenge anyone to name a film made anywhere in the last fifteen years or so to hold a candle to this one.It is simply awesome.As an entertainer it is superb, as purposeful film it goes even further.As a fearless, bold crusader for just causes it is beyond compare.The whole team deserves to be congratulated.Apart from the tremendous contribution made by the writers and the director of the movie, the people who need to be singled out and applauded for the high quality of their work are Aamir Khan(his best role yet),Soha Ali Khan(who finally claims our attention with this role and is destined to be as distinguished as her mother Sharmila Tagore). Waheeda Rehman makes you feel that Guru Dutt is back directing her from heaven.Kirron Kher who is improving with every picture.And all the boys from Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni.All have turned in amazing performances.After Devdas and Munna Bhai MBBS, Binod Pradhan has once again shown that as an ace cameraman he is second to none.And what can you say about A.R. Rahman?This time he even sings like a pro.He is paired here for the first time with Prasoon Joshi who makes you think of Majrooh Sultanpuri.But before I forget, I must mention Alice Patten. She is a joy to behold.And she makes a great pair with Aamir.The film does not have a single dull moment in it.It can be repeated again and again with increasing returns to the viewer.It is a crossover film and needs to be seen by every one in the world.Its publicity and promotion should be geared to that.It should be sent to every international film festival in the world and should be India's entry to the Oscars this year. 
Simply Brilliant Story Narration!!	India	I have watched this movie today on the Republic Day of India, and I was really left speechless with the movie. It ranks among the very best movies. The movie has brought out the best performance from each actor. The movie has a very realistic look to it. And to add to the credits for the movie, the direction and the camera angles are simply mind-blowing. I don't think anybody will be satisfied with watching the movie just once. I think the movie is simply EXCELLENT. All those of you who haven't watched it, please do so. The topic that the movie covers is very much relevant and is something that is going on these days in our country. 
Film Review- Rang De Basanti- India Awakens	United States	Film ReviewRang De BasantiIndia AwakensBy Nidhi KathuriaRating *****'Rang De Basanti' gratifies you with uncomplicated, almost melodious humor; it fills any void that Hindi films altogether may have left inside you dry. From the word 'go', this is one film that grips you one hundred percent. It is a film that every Indian should watch. The film simply flows like poetry where characters have the magical ability to bounce into different periods in time and the past and the present conjoin beautifully like a reverie. And in this moment lies the strength that transforms a common man into an uncommon man. He truly becomes an Indian. 'Rang De Basanti' is not a clich&eacute; patriotic film. And thank goodness for that! One really needed a break from J.P. Dutta and Anil Sharma brand of films. No more over the top acting, melodrama, reckless display of uncontrollable emotions and forced tear jerker deshbhakti songs. It was about time for a novel storytelling, for someone as passionate a director like Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra to tell and for us to hear and see and become. The actors simply glide through with the story and the screenplay by Kamlesh Pandey, which is the USP of the film. Not to take away any credit, Aamir Khan, Atul Kulkarni, Sharman Joshi, Kunal Kapoor and Siddharth really got into the skin of their characters of ones they are and ones they turn into. Even Soha Ali Khan has given her career's best and her unconventional looks proved only advantageous for the character she plays. What 'Mangal Pandey' couldn't do for Aamir Khan, 'Rang De Basanti' does and more. Madhavan in the cameo gives a true to life performance. Om Puri and Anupam Kher didn't have much to do in the script. Kirron Kher on the other hand was exemplary in her 'pucca Punjaban' character. Veteran actor Waheeda Rehman also did justice to her role. One actor who deserves a special mention is debutante Alice Payton who plays the role of Sue, a filmmaker from London, who wants to make a documentary in India called 'Young Guns of India' based on heroes of Pre-Independence era. Sue wants the boy band to don the roles of Bhagat Singh, Azad, Bismil, Rajguru etc. that only act as a baptism of fire, by virtue of which they find courage and strength that was needed when a cyclone behest their lives and demanded of them to raise their voice; a blast that could be heard by our generation, to shake their souls and have a one voice. And hence the film is beautifully titled 'Rang De Basanti'. The dialogues and lyrics by Prasoon Joshi take the film to another level. While Art Direction and Cinematography of the film almost makes you speechless. Every frame of the film is shot with precision and perfection. Needless to say, the editor has also done a super fine job. And now for the music- A.R. Rehman after the wishy- washy music of 'Mangal Pandey' completely absolves himself. A musical journey that takes you on a roller coaster ride that ends in an Awakening. Well, that's what the film hopes to achieve on some level, without being preachy or affected. Salutations to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for giving to our generation a renewed faith and hope, for making us believe that there is a fire kindling in all of ours' souls and no matter where we are and what we do, we love our country.The Story: A young English filmmaker, Sue (Alice Payton), arrives in Delhi to make a film on Indian revolutionaries and their struggle for independent India. She is supported in her venture by her friend Sonia (Soha Ali Khan). After grilling auditioning sessions, when Sue is almost disheartened and doubts if she will be able to find her heroes at all, she comes across DJ (Aamir Khan), Karan (Siddharth), Sukhi (Sharman Joshi), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) and Lakshman Pandey (Atul Kulkarni) and she knows she has found what she was looking for. From sheer playfulness, the group gradually starts to feel the pathos the revolutionaries must have experienced in their battles. All these individuals have a different outlook when it comes to sentiments on Nationalism. Ajay (Madhavan) who is an Air Force and plays Sonia's fianc&eacute; is instrumental in igniting the fire in them and the events that follow, uproot their indifference towards their country and change their lives forever. Rating Scale: * Average **Good ***Very Good****Excellent*****Outstanding 
Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant	United States	Brilliant! Brilliant! Brilliant! Cannot believe that such a movie could be made in Hindi cinema.Complete Kudos to the screenplay,director,actors and the whole team for producing such a brilliant movie.It would be a mistake according to me not to support such movies and label them as preachy or patriotic movies for mocking reasons. Reality is it is a sensible movie which talks to all walks of life.The balance between ideologies,reality and humor has been taken care off in the most spectacular manner; never making the audience feel small,blamed or negative.The characters are very real and they do make a lot of sense. The issues that have been touched are topics which we choose not to talk about or act on but at the same time it is no lecture and the light heartedness of the college environment makes you feel nostalgic and calm.The movie is all about hope. Once again awesome job to the rang DE bas anti team! Peace 
Simply amazing performance by all, especially Aamir	India	Aamir strikes back guys. Its the movie of the year. Simply amazing performances by all. Though i felt that the movie dragged just a little bit in the beginning, the second half was amazing. The movie begins in a very light manner and gets takes a serious turn in the second half. It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system. The performance of Soha Ali Khan was better than I had expected. I specially loved the manner in which the historic events were shown. A truly amazing transformation of normal college students into rebels. Miss it and you will regret it. 
Screenplay, cinematography and Music - 10/10	India	The movie is a blend of few many good things. The best thing about the movie undoubtedly is the comparison and shift from past to present. For people who thought old values are not for modern days, this sure is an eye opener. An excellent music background score by A.R.Rahman. the cinematography is so damn realistic. Excellent screenplay too. There are certain instances where the screen has more than one event being focused at. This makes the movie more natural and easy to relate to. Siddarth might have done a bit of over-acting. but the sensitive Aamir Khan is at sheer acting epitome. Expecting this to be nominated from India for Oscars. Unlike Dil Chahta Hai it is a more heavy and thought-provoking movie sure to rise Nationalist spirits. 
Mohe Tu Rang De Basanti....(Colour Me Yellow)	Mumbai, India	Warning: This is not a movie for he faint hearted or for escapists looking for brainless entertainment.But if you belong to neither of those categories then this one's for you. As a viewer, I didn't know what to expect from the movie. Sure Aamkir Khan was known for quality cinema and all but Mangal Pandey had come as a huge disappointment and I was thinking that this would follow the same lines. Thankfully, I was wrong.One of the most different movies ever seen on the Indian Screen, it is a novel experience for the average moviegoer. One cannot really categorize this movie as Action or Romance or Patriotic etc. However, it falls under one category perfectly: Cult. This movie is sure to achieve Cult status especially among the youth. It has scenes from the lives of Bhagat Singh and other Revolutionaries (the sepia tone give it a really authentic feel) as well as the state of the current youth. But what really makes this movie stand out is how it makes a successful comparative study between the Incidents and Events in the Lives of our Pre-Independence Heroes and the Lives of the Modern Youth of India. As this comparison is brought out (especially in the Post-Interval Portions), it makes your skin crawl. Also the climax is an exhilarating experience though it will meet with diverse reactions. The Story: Sue (Alice Patton in an extremely commendable role) is a British girl who wants to make a movie on Indian Revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Chandrashekhar Azad on the basis of the experiences of her grandfather who was an Officer in British India. Due to shortage of money she convinces a mix bag of college students and slackers to act in her movie (Aamir, Siddharth, Sharman Soha Ali Khan, Atul Kulkarni and Kunal Kapoor. While making the movie, she becomes good friends with them and even gets smitten with D.J. (Aamir).Now these guys have a friend who is an Air Force Pilot (R. Madhavan) whose MiG crashes due to its faulty parts. The entire group is devastated. What angers them further is the Defence Minister's (Mohan Agashe) accusation that the pilot was an amateur. But what really pushes them to the edge is when the Police attacks their peaceful protest march ruthlessly not sparing wither man, woman or child. They decide to take revenge....By killing the Defence Minister. When they succeed in their endeavour, they are shocked to find the Minister being called a Martyr ad being awarded the Bharat Ratna. They decide tat the country needs to know the truth. For this, they take over an All India Radio Station to announce the truth over the radio. What follows is the tense climax that keeps the viewers guessing till the very end.Analysis: The movie has been treated in a very contemporary manner. The dialogues have been penned beautifully. The script is tight. If the first half is filled with light moments then the second half has its share serious scenes. The Punjabi Dialogues come as a breath of fresh air.Apart from the main story, there are a number of sub-plots that are included that raise many issues. Be it the views of a Hindu Fundamentalist about Muslims or the views of a Muslim of the treatment given to his community in the country, it makes the viewer think. There is also the love story between Soha Ali Khan and R. Madhavan as well as the controversy regarding the faulty parts in the MiG airplanes purchased by India and the money made by selfish industrialist (Anupam Kher...wasted) and Ministers. The Music is Excellent. After a hiatus we see A.R. Rahman in full form. The Title Track gives the viewer a sense of elation and the colourful picturisation leaves you wanting more. Also other songs like 'Tu Bin Bataye', 'Paathshala', 'LukaChhupi' and 'Roobaroo' leave an impact on you.Full Marks to Rakesh MEhra for the treatment of the subject. There are a number of scenes that give you chills like:1) D.J.'s breakdown at Sue's house after returning from the hospital. 2) Madhavan's last remains brought to his house for his mother and friends. 3) Atul Kulkarni's delivery of the poem 'Sarfaroshi ki Tamanna' as Ramprasad Bismil. 4) the Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre sequence with replacing the Defence Miniter for General Dyer to explain its contemporary relevance.However, what really makes this movie a true accomplishment is the performances. All of the above would be non-existent if it wasn't for the stellar performance given by the entire cast. Aamir Khan is excellent as the care free Punjabi, but he doesn't steal all the attention. He is supported by equally riveting performances by Siddharth, Kunal Kapoor, Sharman Joshi and Atul Kulkarni. Soha Ali Khan is a revelation compared to her prior films. Her breakdown on hearing of Madhavan's death is one on the most amazing scenes from the movie. Alice Patton is equally good. Her Hindi is sure to strike a chord with the Indian cinegoers. Also, absolutely amazing performances come from Waheedaji and Kirronji. Both lend brilliant support to the movie. One the whole, this movie is a novel experience. A definite recommendation to every youth of India as well as the World. It is a movie that gives you fodder for thought. Also, it is one of those few movies that actually lives up to its tagline: A Generation Awakens. 
Authentic, astounding, amusing, astonishing, amazing, awesome.....	United States	Movies we view come and go, releasing from our minds; however, this particular movie left behind a mark in my heart. It is definitely one of the best movies I have ever viewed in my life. I find it pretty ridiculous when such a movie is compared to LRMB.What i favored most about this extravagant movie was that there was an attempt to conveying a message, and the message is revealed very thoroughly. Human beings tend to complain about negative occurrences, ministers, corruption, unemployment, etc...Yet, rarely any one steps up to change whats wrong, and eventually nothing progresses. This movie encourages you to make a difference in society, and change what is erroneous. EVerything about this movie is just absolutely unique - the screenplay, the colors, the performances, the songs...EVERYTHING. All actors played their roles top-notch. Every actor had an impact in the movie, and shouldve received equal credit from my perspective. Amir, Sharman, Siddharth, Kunal, Atul, Soha, Waheeda, every one stepped up to the plate. Some actors were over looked,such as Alice Patten and Sharman Joshi. Alice had dedication towards her work - her Hindi was very well fluent, and so were her expressions. Sharman did a great job acting innocently comic. Sohas reaction after Ajays death was natural - she fitted into the very skin of her character. Siddharth is a fantastic actor, and hopefully will make it big in Bollywood one day, he handled his character to the maximum level. Amir, as usual, did not disappoint. He was awesome, and very authentic. The movie was modern - so today, and it was something that we can easily relate to. Honestly, when I first purchased the movie last year, I thought it was an over-rated movie just because of Amir Khans comeback; nonetheless, after watching it, I was proved wrong. It was just wow, beyond words. I couldnt manage not to cry at the end. THe quotes in the movie were just lovely, and has the possession of very deep meanings.Overall, this movie deserves a 10, without any questioning. It is a message to the youth of the present era. Get out there - change the negative aspects of the world. This movie DOES NOT ONLY GO FOR INDIANS, however all other countries in south Asia, which contains issues such as corruption, over population, and so forth. I am a Bengali, and the movie impressed me as much as any Indian - because the situations in Bangladesh is alike. Ministers are stealing the countrys money, and they are not caring about the people, or doing anything to improve the country. People suffer each day - due to their very actions. It taught me that we should do something about my countrys political groups, and Prime Ministers. WHOEVER DID NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE, YOU ARE NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU ARE MISSING - go watch it! =D. 
Rang De Basanti  - Reality Does Bite!  ***Sheer Brilliance***	USA	RDB is the rise of a new genre of films for todays youth that will be hailed as one of the all time classics. If Yuva was the ignition RDB is the Spark that lights the fire.A script that is almost flawless and executed with unimaginable comparisons to the pre-independence era is extremely hard to portray. Also to grasp the audience by the throat from the word Go in this over critical world is stunning.Ive watched RDB about a dozen times now and I must say it is equally powerful for the message that needs to be conveyed regarding doing rather than gossipping and being a spectator or passenger in the so called system. We have all been there, we have all done it and are still doing it but RDB makes you more than just aware of it.A virtual tag line Koi Bhi Desh perfect nahi hota, Usey Behther Banaana Padtha hai is quite adorable and delivered by different personalities with exactly opposite ideals, at different times in the movie. Was it right to eliminate a bad powerful person? Maybe Not but it is definitely a way to get the QUICK attention of the ever so unfocused youth of India, myself included.R.O.P.Mehra has presented RDB for the youth and done full justice to them. At the end of RDB, one definitely feels that he has had some kind of rub-in with the government regarding MIGs. He seems to have put his heart and soul into RDB. I wouldnt be surprised if his closest kin was one of the pilots affected due to bad parts in the MIGs.Aamir Khan as DJ (short for Diljeet) has essayed a role that is funny yet focused, comic yet concerned, silly yet sensible and a loafer who becomes a leader. The complexity of this character is probably lost because of the ease at which Aamir is able to become DJ. Being a Bombay-ite to transform into this ever so likable Dilli-ite with that awesome Punjabi oye pehen de takke.. transformation was dumbfounding. On the other hand he is Chandrashekar Azard. No Doubt.Siddharth as Karan Singhania & Bhagat Singh is a revelation. A calmness shown by him breathing life into a character who just Loathes India and becomes the voice of the 5 man Rebels with a cause is sometimes too hot to handle. The emotions and the sincerity of the character are given more than enough respect by Siddharth. He will go a long way in handling intense roles very easily.Soha Ali Khan as Sonia urf Durga Bhabhi is fresh and practical. She does have lots of similarities to Saif Ali Khan but still stands out as her own woman, not just a Sharmila Tagor or SAK clone.Madhavan in his short role as Lft. Ajay is very effective and has a magnetic presence that the group of friends look up to. His chemistry with Soha is simply natural.Sharman Joshi as Sukhi has perfect comic timing and is a great sidekick to DJs jokes. He does show his ability of serious shades when the film turns into a fighting for a cause saga from a light one.Now, the newcomer that I think will get a lot of looks due to his personality and charisma is Kunal Kapoor as Aslam. His difficulty in dealing with a petty family clinging to old virtues and his loyalty to his friends is just too perfect. His physique can only add to his characters in the movies to come and he could be the perfect raw material for directors who want the next Angry, Sensitive and Sensible young man.I just hope RDB does not stay just a movie but truly awakens India. This one is a 10/10 for sure. 
good mix of fun and message	India	The tag line of the film says it all, A generation awakens. This is an attempt to awaken the generation X to the reality, to encourage them to make a difference without giving lengthy lectures and preaches on patriotism and nationalism. So, does the film succeed in doing so..?? Well to a large extent it does. The film manages to invoke the feeling for the nation without any heavy dose of loud hardcore patriotic dialogues. The film is a good mix of fun and message. It delivers the message without loosing the essential fun factor. Amir Khan's one liners keep you alive all through. As expected Amir Khan steals the show but the second leads stand out as well with some good performances. Cinematography, direction and screenplay are of first grade. This one also marks A R Rehman's return to form with some marvellous songs and background score. I would have rated it 10/10 only if the climax was handled a bit better. The end of the story leaves a lot to be desired and the moral of the story is not very clear by its climax. A genuine, honest and good attempt nevertheless. See it and feel good, feel proud and feel moved. 
It sure did Paint my heart Basanti	India	This year gets a perfect start with Rang de Basanti...A movie that is so contemporary...After movies like Dil chahta ha, Black this one really hits me as something new and something different..to start with the story and direction is avant grade and not to forget the acting which has been outstanding...the story has been well thought out..the characters well skated as perfect as when they die in the end the casualness that they depict touches your heart...things they do in the heat of the moment becomes a realization that even they are unaware of and then the big one the climax...many didn't like it..But i just loved it...Bollywood has to learn from this movie to make climaxes like this..the back ground score is outstanding and needs a round of applause..and the cinematography is an institution for aspiring cinematographers....the movies ends on a sad note and still leaves you with a smile...believe me very few movies make that happen... Once again Amir has proved the fact that he is a rock solid actor and the new bunch of actor are a boon to the film and hats off to Rakeshy Mehar for giving us those goose bums and those moments of pride and realization in a much more contemporaries style...It sure did Paint my heart yellow 
I have rated this 20, just that IMDb doesnt allow more than 10 :)	India	Absolutely no words required for you if you relate to India in some or the other way or know something about India or want to know something about India. Just a word of caution, this movie may keep you thinking for hours if not days and weeks. Aamir Khan, Rakeysh Om Prakash Mehra, and even A. R. Rahman just contributed to shoot something as eruptive and yet gorgeous as India - more of a Before and After comparison where there is not much of a difference. Bottomline: Kudos to Mr Mehra for shooting the longest ever commercial till date. The movie sells it to you. And, hard sells!A. R. Rahman got the nerve of the movie and composed his usual best, but still nothing compared to Roja yet. Mehra got lucky and I would have prayed him if only I were to decide not to watch his other movies. Aamir gets lucky every time, he is a carefully marketed commodity which wont lose its luster in the near future, at the least. 
Definitely one of the best movies ever made.	Pakistan	When I first watched Rang De Basanti, it started out as a fair film, telling the story of a group of friends making a film about freedom fighter Bhagat Singh and his friends. As it progressed on i realized, well Aamir has done better than Mangal Panday. Then after the intermission, i said, hmmmm...good film and i dont say that easily. But when the film ended i thought Finally symbolism has returned to Indian cinema, and Aamir has regained his status as a superstar. Aamir Khan easily outclasses himself and all the other performances in 2006 and breathtakingly acts very naturally. This performance is unlike any of his previous ones and certainly the best performance by an actor of his age. Id even say that he outclasses Mr. Bachan in Black and Paa. For this two reasons are present. No.1 both of the roles by Amitabh in Black and Paa were overplayed and both films were copies from two very good Hollywood flicks. The rest of the cast is also very well put together and each and everyone pulls off a decent performance. The soundtrack of the film is perfect for its mood and this is coming from someone who does not, under any circumstances acknowledge A.R Rahman as the Mozart of India. Id recommend this film to anyone who has taste for good cinema and who loves films with a message, because at the end the message in the film is what makes it memorable. Hats off to Rakesh Omprakash Mehra, Aamir Khan and A.R. Rahman and a memorable thank you to the supporting cast that made this film the best of 2006 (in my opinion). 
Leaves you moved, and speechless all at the same	United States	I always believed there were two kinds of men in this world, men who go to their deaths screaming and men who went to their deaths in silence. Then I met the third kind... Those were the first few lines of Rang De Basanti, which is more than just a movie to me. Its a wake up call for anyone who witnesses injustice and just watches. For anyone who wants a change. Ultimately, Rang De Basanti scores due to its innovation. The film does not shy away from being unconventional. Rang De Basanto is a treat to all who love great cinema and to everyone who loves their country.Sue, a documentary filmmaker from England wants to tell the story of Bhagat Singh and his fellow revolutionaries. Despite opposing views by her bosses, she goes to India to make the movie. The story of these men is important to Sue because she read it thru her grandfathers words from his diary. Her grandfather, who was a jailer during that era, had very strong opinions of these boys. Sue reaches India and sees her characters through a young group, and then begins a journey, an awakening.Rakesh Mehra grips you just from the first reel where you see Bhagat Singhs execution about to take place. From beginning to end, one thoroughly enjoys the flick.Rang De Basantis plot is not really what makes it work. Its the characters the viewer understands, loves and in the end leaves the theater with. It may be an ambitious Sue, the lovable D.J., the intense Karan, the crazy Sukhi or even a character like Pandey who one starts out hating and ends up loving.The moments are also another thing one leaves with them. The talk about corruption etc is excellent and so real. We all talk about this in our everyday lives and cant help but agree with the talk. The characters are straight out of reality.There are flaws here, like every movie. The second half does lose steam at times. The biggest problem people had with this movie was the climax, which I thought was also a drawback. I did not hate it but the film could have ended in a different way.A.R. Rahmans music is first rate and comes at the right time. Thankfully, the songs do not interfere with the narrative here. And theyre all brilliant here. Cinematography is international standards here.The writing is good for the most part. The way the stories of the revolutionaries of the past and the present day group collide is brilliantly written. Dialogues are superb.Rakesh Mehras direction is flawless. It kills me to say this, but I dont think hell make another film like this again.Now to the performances...but before that, let me say that there is not a hero in this movie...besides the director. What I mean is that everyones a character here and performed with amazing amount of competence.Aamir khan lives his role here. Everything is perfect in his performance and one really doesnt expect anything less than that from this fab actor. Hes terrific.Sidhart is a revelation. Kunal Kapoor is first rate. Sharman is lovable. Soha plays her part right. The actress who plays the British filmmaker is outstanding. Kirron Kher is great. Waheeda Rahman is as always. The rest of the cast supports well.One more performance Id like to mention is that of Atul Kulkarni. Hes just brilliant. The way his character changes, you see it but he does it so subtly and wonderfully. Hes one underrated talent.Overall - Rang De Basanti is not perfect, but I dont think there is a perfect film out there. However, it does force you to think and at the same times gives you a great time. 
Why this movie was incredible.	Virginia	Now I wont really go into detail about the plot because the idea is great, honestly it alone could have made the movie pretty good. The cinema style and the realism of the movie is what got to me. Stuff like this has happened before throughout history where people take the law into their own hands for the sake of justice. For the sake of clearing corruption. Rang De Basanti makes you think. No matter what your viewpoint is on government, politics and corruption because even the characters themselves are split. This was the first movie (Not just Bollywood) that actually made me put myself into the situation of a revolutionary and in the position of a politic leader. The passion some people have for their country and the freedom of others is remarkable. Before this movie I thought about the topic only when necessary because as an American, we dont directly witness the corruption. Many dont until its pointed out towards them. Every person in the world needs to watch this movie. Because no government is perfect, we must make it perfect. As I said before this movie will make you think and leave an after-effect for days. You might be the type to criticize the government but never do anything to actually help, theres a character for that. Even he sees what he must do and what is right, only the situation can show who can be a true revolutionary.How did it do all that? Well like I said before the plot is pretty good, its original and it has good direction. What make this movie spectacular? The great cast and their performances is the first thing that needs to be pointed out. Alice Patten does a great job and really blends into her role more than any character. Not saying the others dont but she just does it so brilliantly. She was ideal for the role because she has the mild beauty and spark. Amir Khan obviously outshines the rest of the cast again. Can you believe this man is 46? I couldnt during the movie. I didnt once think Hey look at the 46 year old who has a teenage daughter my age. because he completely melted into his character. Spectacular performance. He pretty much blended into the rest of the gang but obviously. He blended into his character who was the hardest to portray. The rest of the cast was about the same but Siddhartha did stand out. His character was the rich youth who only shows negativeness. Without these characters exactly where they needed to be...this movie might have not been so great.The second thing that made this movie stand out was the utilization of the Past-Present shift technique through colored flashbacks. It kept me entertained and both astonished at how bad the revolution was in India. The Music was excellent, I wouldnt say the movie couldnt have gotten better music but it did set a realistic mood. Thank god this wasnt a musical or all respect for the movie would have gone down. This movie shouldnt be compared to Swades. Although that is a great movie, thats what it was...just a movie. Rang De Basanti is a call for change and an eye-opener. Every Desi should watch this movie because the condition in Pakistan and Bangladesh are exactly the same as India. 
Rang De Basanti.....Bollywood Awakens....	India	Aamir Khan is my all time favourite actor.His movies are kind of festive seasons for me.He was returning to silver screen after a hiatus of almost 4 years.And obviously my excitement and expectations were both sky high.I,like always wait for his movies with bated breath.The movie released on republic day.I saw it.Superb,Immaculate,Exemplary and what not...Well movies kind of RDB are once in a lifetime experience and missing it is not less then a sin.The more i see it the more i love it.It really is a thinking viewers movie. It will touch you to the core.It has now become my all time favourite movie.Well,i have too many things to say but then too less too, about this heart wiggling masterpiece.The transformation of fun loving college guys to the rebellious freaks avenging for their friends sacrificed death against the administration has been fantabulous. Aamir Khan as DJ played his role with perfection.It has only enhanced my love and respect for him.Other actors should not be deprived of their credit especially siddharth and sharman were terrific.Now,director did full justice to the the movie by not over-or-under doing anything.The contrast screenplay maintained throughout the movie was the main highlight.He has taken really best out of each actor.Ending was quite throat lumping but then Good movies have to have such things .Music has also complimented screenplay very well.Background score is extra ordinary and the song Luka Chuppi touches the soul.All in all best movie to come out of bollywood till now.The movie will take bollywood to next level....hopefully....bestest,super extra ordinary,brilliant,........and...... 
very absorbing	United States	It is an excellent movie which truly reflects the growing revolutionary-youth-movement in India at present (post 2000). The problem with the MIG flight planes is long, but government has never taken any serious resolution. This movie rightly depicts the situation of a family suffering from this governmental negligence. An Indian army plot dies in a MIG accident. It brings his group of friends start thinking about the social & political problems in India which they always avoided and thought the governmental policies will never going to affect their life directly anyway. This common peoples idea fired back and they even determined to give a repartee to the Indian Government. They assassinated the defense Minister and went public by Radio to announce the cause of their inhuman deed. Though the Government took it as a serious offense but their way of protests worked as an eye-opening for common people.In real life, this movie has already influenced serious public-protests against many governmental policy and some have forced the governmental to go by the public opinion. I would say it a true triumph of democracy and Rang De Basanti just plays that right tune. 
One word AMAZING	US	When I started watching this movie I was like this cant be a good one. About some random kids acting all over the place. But I had Amir Khans old movies in mind. The guy can really act. But just like what the other users said this isnt all about him. All other actors did an amazing job.I am myself a paki-American, being raised in a paki family and visited there I know what corruption is and what people deal with everyday. This movie does an amazing job of waking people up. Its time to wake up people, and make or break your life. I hope this gets nominated for an Oscar like Lagaan did. 
Rocking film for the Youth! Delivers the message far without the usual stereotypes!	Mumbai, India	Plot Outline: Sue (Alice Patten) is inspired by the legendary characters of Bhagat Singh, Azad et al from her grandfathers diaries during his days in the British Raj. She lands in Delhi to make a film on them and finds those characters in Sonias (Soha) friends DJ (Aamir), Karan (Siddharth), Aslam (Kunal Kapoor) & Sukhi (Sharman Joshi). The friends belong to Gen Next who care not about values like Patriotism & Sacrifice. The accidental death of their friend Flt Lt Ajay Rathod (Madhavan) in a MIG Crash and the wrongful blame on the pilot makes them take up cudgels against the corrupt establishment.Comment: Very rarely are movies that talk of relevant values for the Youth. Most of the Patriotic movies are full of either anti-angrez or anti-Pak sentiments with heaps of Melodrama thrown in. With RDB, Rakeysh Mehra has made a significant movie from stereotypes. Unlike others, RDB does not have the typical hero & heroine. Aamir and his friends are people the youth can easily identify with. They are simple minded students who live care free lives and they plainly react normally. Those who have disliked this movie are the ones who prefer stereotyped abnormalities.Most notable performance in RDB is that of Siddharth whose character grows as the movie progresses. Aamir, of course has been brilliant but looks too old to play a College Student. Some of the movies best moments are Madhavans proposal to Soha, breaking down of Aamir in Sues apartment, Atul Kulkarnis recital of Bismils poetry and of course the last scenes of Siddharth and Aamir. Dont miss AR Rahmans youthful and soulful music too! Quotes thrown in RDB include: There are two primary choices in life, to accept conditions as they exist or take upon the responsibility to change them. Inspiring, isnt it? Watch the movie to get charged. This one is highly recommended for those whore young and those who still think themselves to be young! 
Brilliant	Malaysia	Simply A Brilliant Movie. People from all nationalities should watch it for the message that has been delivered.Contrary to the belief on this forum, this is not an India-centric movie. The message is universal and should be applauded.Patriotism and Freedom are universal expressions, for which we strive for even today after getting rid of the colonial rulers. However, this time we are prisoners of a different kind, wherein we need to break the shackles yet again from our fellow nationals, the enemies.The message is subtle, the acting is brilliant and the punch is heart wrenching. 
Best Movie Ever !!!	United Kingdom	i juz finished watching RDB ... and I'm Speechless! I'm a Pakistani, but i had tears in my during ending episodes. whether, it is Pakistan or India, both govt. are corrupted and we are corrupted. Nowadays, we are living but without a soul. This movie followed by Swades, made me and i hope my friends ... ppl from my generation will wake us from living such dead and shallow life. RDB is definitely one of the best shown the ugly side of politics however politics is ugly ... One should realise how our ancestors sacrificed themselves for their and Our's Independence Which we take for granted. We should be ashamed of ourselves. We keep saying abt revolution and change and same time, say our country has no future. How it is possible, when we feel nothing for our country? Well, this should be my review on the movie but i wrote what i really felt at the end of the show. Must say ... buy your next show ticket and Be Patriotic ..Just for once please! thanksfrom, a person living far from his own homeland and just thinking about his own life. 
Fantastic!	India	In continuation of Indian Cinema's new found interest in dishing out sensible stuff, Rang De Basanti is a runaway winner in terms of acting, direction, screenplay..you name it, and of course MESSAGE. The movie very aptly captures the lives of our youth, but more importantly goes further than portraying a carefree hedonistic lifestyle by providing them important issues to deliberate on. Like how to pro actively deal with corruption, and how to respect the sacrifices made by our predecessors to achieve our almost taken-for-granted independence. Also, the issue of equanimity between Hindus and Muslims is dealt with very well. The camera-work is fantastic. Great scenes captured from Delhi and other places. A lot of sharp humor interspersed with the typical Punjabi-style wit acted by Aamir Khan. Sidharth Narayan and Kunal Kapoor have done their roles proud. Soha Ali Khan is as cute as can be and does a very mature role. Sharman Joshi, however, is the pick of the lot as his role involves a lot of grey areas and changing character. In all, a MUST SEE for Indians everywhere! I'd give this movie a perfect 10! 
Bollywood comes of age	India	Director Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra merges two plots in RANG DE BASANTI. The first is about a group of friends, their bonding, the carefree lifestyle they lead. The second plot pertains to the past, when freedom fighters sacrificed their lives during the era before independence. Mehra draws parallels between Indians ruled by the British and Indians ruled by corrupt politicians today. The message is subtle at first, but echoes piercingly before it reaches its finale. The transition of the five friends from meaningless to meaningful existence is done brilliantly.Rang De Basanti has a story to tell, is not a ripoff of some exotic film, but the story is told at a leisurely pace. Is it a patriotic film? Yes and no. Is it a fun film? Yes and no. Is it a serious film? Yes and no. Does it have a neat ending? Yes and no.Thats the beauty of Rang de Basanti. Its the film which shows that bollywood is indeed coming of age.A R Rahman lives to his reputation in Rang De Basanti. Binod Pradhan's cinematography is lyrical, and Adman Prasoon Joshi evokes the youth lingo with his dialogues. Sameer Chanda's art direction and Allan Amin's action sequences are its other strong points.Aamir gets into the skin of the character and delivers a knockout performance from start to end, but the film has more gems when it comes to performances: Siddharth is excellent, Atul Kulkarni is fantastic, Soha Ali Khan is a complete revelation, Kunal Kapoor is natural and Sharman Joshi delivers a powerful performance.Alice Patten is brilliant and besides delivering a flawless performance, her style of speaking Hindi is sure to win a lot of hearts. Madhavan is likable. Waheeda Rehman is graceful as ever. Both Om Puri and Anupam Kher don't get much scope. Kiron Kher is exceptional yet again. Mohan Agashe, Steven Mckintosh, K.K. Raina and Lekh Tandon are adequate.But ultimately, despite sharing the screen space with others, this is an Aamir Khan film. And the actor, playing a character 15 years younger, lives the role, conveying the right amount of mischief (as in the banter in Hindi with Sue without realizing she knows the language), carefree flippancy, earnestness, insecurity, even breaking down on screen, and keeping his infectious laughter till the very end.Well, in the movie its said  I always thought that there are two kinds of men; those who met their deaths screaming and those who die in silence. And then I met the third kind Similar type of feeling triggered in my mind too, There are movies made with some moral(some underlying message), some are pure entertainers, not making much sense. Yesterday i came to know about the third kind...........that leaves you with a thought, a thought................... 
One of the best movie i have ever seen	India	Its been around 8 years when this movie was released. I dont even have a count, how many times i have watched this movie. There was a time, when i used to watch this movie almost daily.You have everything in this movie that you expect. Everyone played their roles in the best way possible.Amir/Siddharth/Kunal/Shraman did fabulous job so the other. You cant not forget even the smallest role in the movie.Music is the other best part of the movie. From Tu bin bataye to Khoon chala...all songs are very good.My rating is 10/10 
a must watch movie for young generation	Bangladesh	We the people of Indian sub-continent always frustrated about our national politics, moral degeneration etc. We always wonder how our national martyrs sacrifice their lives for the country . It seems impossible for us. We think no one of this era can love their country like our ancestors. So, there is no way to get rid out of these problems. But ,this movie show that everyone can become Vagat Singh . Time and environment creates these Vagat Singhs.Another masterpiece from Amir Khan. His acting was simply superb. The acting of other actors is also very good.And the direction was also world class. This movie can highly motivated the young generation. 
A living built on contrasts...	Sofia, Bulgaria	The overall suggestion of the movie is so strong that some imperfections could be bypassed - for example, needless blood coverage and unrealistic shreds all over the garments of the students after the protest. And mainly the whole overjoy dominating the first half.It is understandable that the contrast makes the suggestion stronger.May be this is the only way an Indian can suggest an idea?! :)) Or may be this is just how life happens in India - with constant contrasts...What am I saying?! Why India only? ;)P.S. You can expect to laugh and cry sincerely in this movie. And above all, youd probably want to go to see this country, like I did. 
Brilliant	Canada	Brilliant film! A great story, backed up by great direction, screenplay and music. The plot too, is highly inspiring.Movie has Absolutely contrasting halves but still conveys its message loud and clear. Supported by the great music composed by A.R. Rehman that goes very well with the story.As the capture line reads .. A Generation Awakens .. it certainly sums it up best.I hope it will inspire every Youngster to Hav there interference in their Surrounding and know their Politics as well.Aamir has performed yet another astounding role where he has given a new meaning to practical comedy and frivolous mischiefs. 
One of the Best Film !!	India	First and foremost I would like to request some reviewers with Hollywood hangover to shut up . This film has the best of everything from acting , direction, music to story . People who think some scenes from the film were overblown clearly would also say that Bhagat Singh couldnt have gone into the parliament with a bomb . For them this is as unreal as shooting of a high rank British official in broad day light. Pseudo Intellectuals bashing aside this film awakens a generation . The plot and scenes are taken from real life and real life has taken from its plot and scenes. The situation of police beating innocent people is very much evident in every part of the world let alone India.The last scene is very emotional and gives you a perfect hangover even after the film has ended. All in all I dont want ruin your experience of this film , its a must see *period*. 
Awesome awakening of a new generation	India	Fabulous movie.The only word i could say after my first view of it.But with more seeings this one gets even better.Rang De Basanti has everything,from great performances to some terrific direction with some very good evergreen songs plus you have the star himself leading from the front Aamir Khan.I aint surprised by his choice of movies.He is a class apart.You expect such performances from him  he always peaks.Lets talk of the performances first.Fantastic performances all the way.From Aamir Khan to Kunal Kapoor to Atul Kulkarni to Soha Ali Khan to Siddharth to Sharman Joshi.Everyone simply deliver with much grace.Waheeda Rehman,the legendary actress performs again a stunning role  gives her best.Alice Patten as Sue was sensational.Everything was just so perfect.The direction was flawless.Beautiful contrast scenes of the present  that of the old freedom fighting days are brought together.Rehman music stands apart.Song like Khalbali add spice  fun for the youth generation whereas song like Khoon Chala displays their anger  will for justice.The songs Luka Chupi  Tu Bin Bataye also are some class songs in the movie.The voice of Lata Mangeshkar in Luka Chupi song is just a honor in itself.Terrific plot with great vision from the director makes this a must watch for everyone.The movie adds fire to your heart  the youth of India begin to awake just to take that first step towards freedom.A rare awakening of a generation  until people keep on seeing this movie,Rang De Basanti will always stand a class apart from the rest. 
Amazing movie from Bollywood	Pakistan	Its an amazing movie from Bollywood. This is the first movie i have seen ever before. Amazing acting by Aamir Khan as always. Music is also amazing each and every song is excellent. AR. Rehman has done an excellent job for the Music of Rang De Basanti. I wish that this movie should be awarded for Oscar Awards 2007.The film stars Aamir Khan, Soha Ali Khan, Madhavan, Kunal Kapoor, Siddharth, Sharman Joshi, Atul Kulkarni, British actress Alice Patten, Waheeda Rehman, Om Puri, Kiron Kher and Anupam Kher. The music is by A. R. Rahman and the album went on to become a chartbuster. The movie was well-received all over the globe, and grossed Rs. 345.5M in its opening week.[1] The film has recently been selected as Indias entry to the Golden Globe Awards and will compete in the foreign language film category.The music is composed by A. R. Rahman and lyrics for the songs are written by Prasoon Joshi.Rang De Basanti - sung by Daler Mehndi and Chitra Ek Onkar - recited by Harshdeep Kaur Khalbali - sung by A. R. Rahman, Mohamed Aslam and Nasim Khoon Chala - sung by Mohit Chauhan Lalkaar - recited by Aamir Khan Luka Chuppi - sung by Lata Mangeshkar and A. R. Rahman Pathshaala (Part 1) - sung by Naresh Iyer and Mohamed Aslam Pathshaala (Part 2: Be a rebel) - sung by Blaze, Naresh Iyer and Mohamed Aslam Rubaroo - sung by A. R. Rahman and Naresh Iyer Tu Bin Bataye - sung by Naresh Iyer and Madhushree 
one of the finest movie made in the world history	hyd, India	The movie deserves Oscar since it has the finest screenplay,script,direction ever done.Also the way in which two stories in the movie interact together in the climax is just marvelous.10 out of 10 for this movie.....The movie is not only worth to watch, but also inspires young generation to think seriously of their duties towards their motherland.One can take lessons in film making from this movie.The movie is not only a big hit but also has made its mark in each and every Indian citizen.So, i think that the jury at the Oscars should just look at this film at least once since Indians films are mostly neglected by them 
a total stunner	None	i loved this movie. hope this was enough to motivate you to watch it.All the hype about this movie being an ideal piece to represent Bollywood is totally true. This movie doesnt have a lot of the famous actors we know especially for me coz Im an nri. But i think this does justice to the movie.All performances were great. It wasnt a mistake to cast Aamir in a role almost half his age.i loved the soundtrack. I cant get it out of my head.its a must watch... go ahead and buy a DVD. coz i bought one. and yeah for all those emotional buddies out there be ready with tissues.ENJOY 
probably one of the most powerful cinemas of India which created a revolution)	India	One of the rare scenario where a film had started a movement. a lot has been said about the film so i will concentrate more on the after effects. India - a country where corruption is sky high and power can even buy you a mother and a whore at the same time it was really commendable to see Indian people getting influenced by the movie to start a movement to give justice to Jessica Lal (who was was shot dead in front of almost 300 stalwarts in the heart land of Delhi by a ministers son). In the RDB way people lit a candle near India Gate and there were thousands of people in the march.The pressure from common man was so strong that government were forced to look into the case which was earlier manipulated by those in the powers..finally justice was given...Now that the power of cinema to start a revolution..that is Rang DE Basanti for you.. Well some friends may not agree with me but i feel we the young India should do the same as done by the character of Siddharth in the movie..Shoot at your fathers dick from a point blank range if you find him to be a corrupt politician,businessman,bureaucrat or any stalwart. In this way a new movement can begin.. and coming to the cinema hats off to Rakeysh OmPrakash Mehra for making such a strong comments through his cinema.In a land where staying coward is camouflage with flavors of Non Violence he dared to write a script that shows the spirit of true freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh..and oh boy! in a superb way he interwove the narrative with present youth thus moving the screenplay in a non linear pattern with reflections of past and present. Kudos to whole team of Rang DE Basanti again (a movie which i saw 6 times in the theater only) 
Aamir, original and superb actor. The only in Bollywood with so much talent.	United States	Aamir khan simply the best Bollywood actor we have today!! Movie was awesome. He is very talented. Top of Bollywood. Original actor. Chocolate actor. Able to do any role provided. Best of the best. Aamir Khan's style has always been copied buy top bollwood actors. Even top stars have follwed his path and tried to imitate his very unique style. People salutes him for his work and passion for his work. Always perfect!!! He is very down to earth unlike others in bollywood. Words can't decribe him and his work. Love his work and kinds of movies that be mades and just rocks box office around the world. There was no one like him there is no one like him and there won't be anyone like him. Very amazing actors and the only one. 
Absolutely great	Europe	One of the best movies of the past few years. Finally a movie talking about contemporary issues, and about young people who believe in something. This was my first Bollywood movie and I really enjoyed being cast in a world I barely know. The movie goes through several interesting themes, like clash of cultures (Muslims in India), a love story, contemporary Indian politics, family values... but everything is interwoven in a clever way so that you dont lose track. The plot is also good and not predictable. I am so tired of watching movies that tell nothing new, with actors that put no passion, and stories that you saw a hundred times already. I am also tired of the absence of ideals, of big issues, not only in movies but in general. This movie was surprising and bold. 
Already ready	Switzerland	A year and a half ago I commented on Lakshya: Don't expect a rabid anti war or anti establishment film. The time has not yet come for this in Bollywood. With Rang de Basanti Bollywood has made a film that clearly does not shy away from pointing a finger at the holy cows 'army' and 'government' and dares to suggest that corruption and infamy extend up to the highest ranks and most respected institutions of Indian society. While the opening offers the usual disclaimer (fictional story bla bla) the end draws clear parallels to reality. And what the characters in the film think and say reflects what young Indians actually do think and say. This is not Bollywood fantasy land, running around trees and you know the drill. It's nonetheless a genuine Bollywood film. Just a far better one than the usual kind. Good performance from an ensemble cast all around, no superstar shenanigans, catchy music, an inventive visual style, technically sound execution and a quite realistic script make this one a winner not to be missed. Go see it on the big screen. 
What was all the hype about anyway?	United States	Let me say that I love all types of movies, but this one was just torture. The first hour is a waste of time, her accent is frustrating and the behavior of the rest of the characters is borderline obnoxious. The story about the revolutionaries was great, but you get twenty seconds of it in between five minutes of garbage. Save yourself some time and watch something else OR skip the first hour, that way you will only waste 72 minutes of your life. Its an Indian movie, believe me youll figure out the story line even if you skip an hour. It upset me to see this movie at #3 on the top 100 list of Bollywood films. The entire story line is ridiculous, and the connection they tried making between revolutionaries fighting for freedom in a colonized India and five stupid college kids and a white girls fighting a corrupt government in 2006 was an epic fail. 
like a fresh breath of colors but still not a rainbow	United States	(Note - may contain spoilers! )RDB is a different movie, contemporary in it's screenplay, music and theme. Patriotic movies more often ignite the spirits within you, some question the System, some question the people. But none has suggested a solution, a realistic solution, not a hypothetical projection of a historic depiction.This movie attempts to recreate the aura, psyche of Bhagath Singh and Azad's troupe in modern day era. It simply is a rendering of the past in the present context. It doesn't try to tell you whether Bhagat Singh is right or wrong or whether what the 4 college guys did is right or wrong. It just says - This is what happens, when some people stand up and believe in what they fight. This is whats gonna happen to any youth in this country if the Government continues to BS around and no you don't need no Al Qaida to do, just normal people can.Whats the result?Instead of a History Channel on Bhagath Singh, you get a contemporary rendering of the characters in present day India with a seemingly interleaving screenplay of past/present. Most biopics on Bhagat Singh tried to portray as him as an extra ordinary person and simply repaint history without telling the psyche and the circumstances. I think thats why this movie deserves a great applause by rendering a difficult subject wrt the present people, people like you and me who never thought of execution of the thought.The cast is first rate. After a long time, you will feel that a popular Hindi cinema has no stars, just characters.(I can only remember Lagaan, Swades, DCH close to this in terms of characterisation in the recent past). AR Rahman, brilliant.Its sad to see so many good movies with his good music do not get the attention that he truly deserves.Well, here comes the down part. The first half makes you completely fall in love with this movie and just when you start building expectations ... the movie fails. Starting with the protest of Ajay's flight accident, assassination of Defense Minister (quite cool eh? Didn't know that you could just shoot a minister point blank and still nobody can figure out who the killer is. Quite stupid), to the insanely gruesome mass shooting towards the end, this is where you start to feel that the director is using too much of liberty and insisting you not to use your brains.Watch out for some of the best moments - 1) When Amir cries for Madhavan at the dinner table, telling how useless, helpless he is. Brilliant acting. I always consider a tragic scene as extremely difficult coz you just don't cry seeing the actor cry, but if it gives u a millisecond of gasp- he deserves an applause. 2) when the 4 buddies remove their shirts and wave across a fighter plane just grazing on their above. Wonderful poetry! Also shows that you don't have to have great bods to remove the shirt. It could still look great. 3) last scene with Siddharth / Amir when they're smiling to glory ...Acting is great ... no one has screwed up in any dept. However the last 1 hour is a bit amateurish and could have been avoided with more sophistication. Like all those movies which try to say something about patriotism, this one brags about it too, yet in a different subtler warning tone. But my point iswhat do we do now. Do you have a solution?When will we see a movie which could bring us hope, which addresses the Issues and brings out the execution in reality? Opinions like these will come and go but the Problem still remainsthe bottom line 8/10 - Brave attempt on cinematography, music, screenplay, casting and storytelling of 6th class history. Ironically, the premise of the movie should have been told in writing by the director towards the end, saying its just a ironic depiction of the past and not the moral of the story. Unfortunately for some viewers the message could be deceptive as its very very subtle.Swades on the other hand could be realistic, it hits you hard, very deeply with a message 
ambivalent views	United States	The movie is one of the marvels of the Indian Theatre ,beautifully blending historical flashes with modern settings .All aspects of the movie including acting,music,cinematography are excellent and it is a must see for ones who are looking for an out of the box movie.At the same time I would like to say that I personally am not in favor of the ending.I feel that is a very wrong message that the Indian youth is getting.The idea of trying to wake up the society with extreme measures is inappropriate.Killing people is never a solution for any malice that is ingrained in the population.The same idea during the independence revolution was totally different and i respect that totally being a strong patriot myself but the movie is a bad example for the young people who already have fire in their blood and cannot think rationally.The movies have a great impact especially on young people and many try to imitate them.If a system has to be changed it has to be done by intellectual stimulation and general awareness not killing the bad guy!.We have to teach our youth the same thing. Having said that I would like to say that the director definitely has the right to project his thoughts but I differ about the message the movie gives and thought its worth sharing my ideas with everyone. 
Nice Movie	India	The movie begins in a very light manner and gets takes a serious turn in the second half. It basically tells a story of how truly normal students get ready to even risk their lives in their fight against the system.Rang De is definitely a very brave and innovative attempt by the director and for that matter he has selected a near perfect cast.The film grows on you gradually. The director has made sure that there is a clear message in everything he presents, even the group of boys represents different sects of society and religion. Hence creating an appeal for everyone watching it. Music is another high point of the show, its foot tapping and very much with the mood of the subject. The songs give you a sense of freedom from within, a freedom to think in ones own way. A.R. Rahman doesnt need any introductions and he is surely one of the most original music directors we have in the country. he is definitely Oscar deserved person. 
True revolution...	Greece	Rang De Basanti is a drama movie in which we watch an English filmmaker who casts a group of students in order to to produce o documentary / drama about Indias revolution against British in the 1920s. Everything change when she meets DJ, who is a guy who graduated five years ago but he is still in the University because he does not have many expectations about the outside world.I liked this movie because of the plot which I found very good. The direction which made by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra was also very good. About the interpretations of this movie I have to mention for one more time the great interpretation of Aamir Khan who played as Daljeet DJ / Chandrashekhar Azad. Another equally good interpretation made by Alice Patten who played as Sue.Finally I have to say that Rang De Basanti is a really good movie and is really worth seeing because it shows us how many things can change in the life of a person when he learns to think and see things different. Everything is possible and everything can change, we just have to watch things from a different angle. 
No words except    cest extraordinaire	Essaouira, Morocco	In 2006 i bought a DVD intituled RANG DE BASANTE with a big picture of Aamir khan in the couverture, I said with my self thats will a film like the others when the entire content is focused on the HERO... I put it in a cabinet and I forget it for near 2 years. Some day in August 2008 When I was leads to reclassify my luggage for a trip, I found it, I decided to take a break with it, 3 hours later I found my self pressing Replay button.It was a very different experience from the beginning to the end . Simply magnificent, great, epic.Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra done a fantastic job as director, in screen play too with Renzil DSilva, the story also was stunning, and every actor done his part in a incredible manner.Rand de basanti presented on the best way possible,The socio-political situation in third world countries (my country Has almost the same features),all by highlighting the story of the people who sacrificed their lives for the future of his country.Almost every part of the film was made perfectly,Even in the smallest details.in summary, RDB is the best film ever made in bollywood by far (I watched almost every Indian realise since 1995), and this one was undoubtedly one of the best films in the history of cinema. 
First time a review	Istanbul	I feel my self lucky that i just realize that there are still good movies out there. Why am i lucky??? Because i have got too many titles to watch and enjoy as of today. Thank you khan thank you India. Warm, happy, mind tickling, funny... Only three days ago i was not aware of bollywood and aamir khan but know they got me and i am a fan. It was pure luck, my girlfriend somehow watched the movie online in my ipad one night, the next day while i was checking the tabs i just saw the tab for p.k. I just click the play and i was in for abt 170 mins without blinking of an eye :) i wish i should be able watch in the theater but in Turkey there is no chance so far. 
Thats what world want from Indians movies again....	India	Starting of story with some fun of college guys ..nd linking their r after seriousness with the story of revolution for the independence of India, on which they laugh at one time... seriously awesome work of drama .Every thing is perfectly executed. The story line , acting of every one, every single role given, the tracks, background music, and the music given by A.R.Rahaman one of best work by him. A must watch movie for a real classic movie lover. The ending is somehow not feel good because of the attachment with the characters we had created till than. But above all this a perfect work of cinema. 
Best Hindi movie you will ever find	United Kingdom	Not only this movie has the superb plot it was also perfectly executed.It shows the corruption of India and how it affected a bunch of young men.As well as how it affected them psychologically and the actors have shown it brilliantly. Not only that they have shown of young men in the past fighting for the independence of India even if it meant giving up their life. There was also settling the difference between Muslims and Hindus and fighting their causes. This movie also exposes the corruption and greed of India. This is what makes the movie the best and deserves a 10 rating.You cannot miss this watch it now! 
One of the finest movie of this generation. Its not a movie, its a movement.	India	One of the finest movie of this generation. Its not a movie, its a movement.We were 13-14 friends who went to see this in Shiva theatre (dilsukhnagar, hyderabad) on Jan 26th 2006. It was Kranthi, Rutwik, Venkat, Raghuveer, Manthan, Anirudh, Dinackar, Satish among those whom I can recollect. Now, the film began rolling, Kranthi who was next to me said, what movie have we come to, there is Bhagat Singh reading his diary and it was a sepia shot. Before, this I got the CD and was is love with the music of the film, I thought it would be youthful, dreamy and completely joyful. The title too seemed be inapt when I just heard the music. Then the film began on its course and as the watch fell and titles began to roll, we got a glimpse of what we were about to witness in the titles itself. I must say, till this date I have liked no other titles as this one and the background music by A R Rahman, he put al his genius into it. We were all happy then itself. We got into characters, there was Aslam, DJ, Karan, Sukhi Ram, Laxman Pandey and Ajay and also Sue (Su Kar Mere Mann Ko) all the right chords were touched in casting and we also had the legendray Waheeda Rehman play Ajays mother and other good actors in the roles of mothers and fathers. The story was about Su coming to India to make a film on our lost and forgotten freedom fighters. Chandrashekhar Azad, Bhagat Singh and others. It was paced as if we are told the whole revoultionary story in the most enaging way possible. Indeed, that is the only way we relate to this, there is a need for freedom in one way, at least the Gandhian way is not working now so lets try the Bhagat Singh way. We may die but yet we shall die happily. If there is any film that has made me believe in myself more and to fight for what I believe is right, then this is the film. What DJ stood for what he believed in though he could not believe it in the first place. Laxman is a symbol of the uncorrupt youth who are being dragged into partisan politics and being corrupted. Karan is the cool dude who worries about rich gear and not about this country much. Aslam is the poet who has a big heart and a brave vision. I loved them all and thanks to the writer director Rakesh Mehra for bringing them on all alive, not just as friends but as the freedom fighters whom I wish not to forget. Revolution is what I strived for since I saw this, and most of it is exhibited in the office job where I am a warrior of nothing but honesty and truth. I love them both (truth and honesty) and this film did show that to me. Getting back to the movie, so by the time we were at interval. None of us moved no one grabbed a drink or popcorn, we were in love with what we saying but were thinking and talking where this is going to lead. Raghu said Cinematography super Rutwik said I like Karan the film began post interval and all were glued again. When a tragedy struck and when Lukka Chuppi played, I was having tears and just could not imagine that such a beautiful song was written for such great tragedy. A mother has lost her son and Lukka Chuppi is what it is, hide and seek. I feel numbness in my fingers even as I type this now, then we got Khoon Chala, now the time has come to overpower all our politicians, and these guys just tried to do that at the end and what a tragedy has struck them. They became martyrs. The movie ended, we were struck to our seats, Venkat said, now lets leave. We started walking slowly and got onto our bikes and went to Raghuveers home. From the time we left the theatre till we reached his home and sit in his room, there was silence, I dont know why and we were all silent I am sure. Raghu said You need something and our silence broke. This is how vividly I can imagine the whole experience of Jan 26th 006. I just cant forget that. This movie did lot many things to us on that day at least I am sure and I believe most of us still have this feeling at the back of their mind. I just am so thankful for the makers, the actors and very crew man of this wonderful movie. I cant even rate this, but a 5/5 for what it did. Even 6 years later all is very fresh and am still hopeful of doing something. This was the first DVD I bought for myself and am happy that I did. I just cant let go of this movie. It may not the best in cinematic terms maybe as I have heard a mixed opinion down the years, but the screenplay is just awesome and so the background score and cinematography. The songs, the emotion, the poetry. Go watch all of it and I am sure, most of you will love it again.I am sorry if this became more of an autobiography than a movie review, but just wanted to share it.
