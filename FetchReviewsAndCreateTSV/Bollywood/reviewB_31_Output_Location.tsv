Plain Excellent	Brussels, Belgium	This movie is just the best movie i have seen. (I have watched around 570 movies) (Its my favorite movie).It has all the elements that a good movie must have:Excellent Dialogues.Excellent Music.Excellent Acting. (Even the extras where excellent)Excellent Story/Plot.Good Songs.And it has much genres, who are handled very well in this movie: Action/Comedy/Romance/Drama/Adventure/Thriller (not really, but a kind of Thriller)/Musical/Crime. Each word of this movie is excellent. I think it has the greatest story ever! I was hurted when i came to know that Mr. Ram Gopal Varma is remaking this classic... Despite becoming the most successful film of its time, it failed to win any major popular or critics awards. The lone Filmfare award it got went to M.S. Shinde for Best editing. The plot is about a retired police officer Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) who hires two convicts Veeru and Jai (Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan) to capture Gabbar Singh (a Dacoit) who had killed the cops entire family (except the cop and his daughter-in-law).Who has not seen this movie, try it once, you will love it. ***** 
Brilliant	Austria	 If you liked Once upon a time in the west, The magnificent seven and A fistful of dollars, you will love Sholay. It takes all the good ingredients of a western, spices it with a lot of Indian ingredients and lets it simmer until you get one of the finest curry westerns imaginable. Though obviously very much inspired by the spaghetti westerns of the late 1960s/early 1970s, this easily surpasses most of the films it's modeled after. A masterpiece. 
Perfect Movie	USA	 Can't find a single flaw in the movie. Probably one of the best ever made in Hindi. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. The music is memorable. One of the movies you remember for life. 
No arguments.	Los Angeles, CA	 No film before or after Sholay has achieved as much - running to full houses in an unbroken 6 year stretch! Consider the fact that this happened in India - where the audiences have the most choices amongst all the people of the world. Consider the fact that no movie anywhere in the world has been able to reap even half this success that Sholay enjoys.It is potent, does not pretend, and has clearly been made with courage and conviction. It was made for the enjoyment of its predominantly Indian, fun-loving audiences, so my dear detractors from the clan of the perennially cynical, reality-fed, fun deprived masses of the world, kindly excuse yourselves. Sholay is quintessential Mumbai produce - you either consume and enjoy in total acceptance, or you're not fit for the ride. It is as simple as that.The world would be a poorer place without films like Sholay, not only because of the almost arrogant instantaneous and total suspension of disbelief it demands from its audiences, but because of the honesty and sheer power of that demand. You go to a boxing match to see two boxers fight it out, not to see them playing chess in the middle of the ring!Sholay will always be an incredible and shining example of purity, because it was the purest attempt made to entertain, with absolutely no quarters even considered for critical acclaim from the so called pundits of cinema.Yours truly is guilty of seeing this film 23 times to date, 17 of these in the theatres. And if opportunity allows, I wouldn't mind being sentenced to death with more of this guilt delightfully added to my conscience.As with any other film, there have been many comments on what is wrong with Sholay. To these, here is my personal quote - A good film is about getting most things right, not about getting the fewest things wrong!And here is my response to other heartless comments on Sholay being a copy of some other film or filmmaker's work - If every human was an original, we would have 6 billion different species without a single one to call friend or family.To argue against failure may be human, but to argue against success is sub-human. You may limit yourselves if you so wish. 
Great Movie... Everyone should have seen this movie at least one time !	Germany	Great Movie... Everyone should have seen this movie at least one time ! I bought this movie on DVD now, although I am not a big fan of elder films... i love this film, and especially the dialogs of GB ! For all Amitabh fans its a must have movie ! The whole story is really good and the movie has a flair of an American western. Even the sound of Sholay and the atmosphere which is given to the watcher are one of the best i have seen in Bollywood. I have heard, there will be a remake of this film, but I think it could not be as good as the original Sholay. All because of the actors like Amjad Khan who was born for this role. This film is one of bollywood's best movies ever. 
The Definitive Masterpiece...	United Kingdom	As a strong fan of the American Western genre and of course the directing of Sergio Leone, it is with great enthusiasm that i recommend Sholay to any audiences or fans of Westerns and Bollywood cinema.Perhaps, the greatest film in the history of Bollywood cinema (with one of the longest theatrical runs in Bollywood history), this is the definitive Bollywood action epic movie in the same way that Leone's 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' was the definitive Western.The film features the acting talents of such Bollywood legends...Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra and focuses at its heart, a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai & The Magnificent Seven.If you have not watched it, then make it your priority to watch it at least once in your life, as this is definitely one of the movies that every person needs to experience.A true cinematic masterpiece. 
one of the greatest Hindi ever made !	Los Angeles	This movie has everything, comedy, action, drama, romance, fun, emotions. Great performance by all the characters. They are remembered even today in 2004 after nearly 30 years of the film release. I heard that this movie is now re-released with remastered sound. wow ! cant' wait to fetch the DVD of this remastered version.The most impressive role of Gabbar by Amjad Khan was portrayed extremely well. Its also one the longest movie. Its quite normal for bollywood movies to be 3 hours long. But this one is even longer than this. But certainly ever minute of the movie is enjoyable.This movie is my all time favorite. 
The Greatest Story Ever Told!	None	Kitne Aadmi Thei, every Indian film fan knows this dialog by heart. Sholay was released in 1975, also the year I was born in, coincidence, perhaps. The film became the longest running Indian film in the theaters, a record that stood for over 25 years until it was broken recently by another classic Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (holds the current record 500 Weeks and still going - as on May 07, 2005).Sholay was written by the great Duo of Javed Akhtar and Salim Khan know as Salim-Javed. The duo also gave us films like Don, Shakti, Shaan, Zanjeer, Seeta Aur Geeta and Deewar. The film was directed by Ramesh Sippy and had music of legendary R.D. Burman. Sholay gave us a Character called Gabbar Singh played by Amjad Khan, who made his debut with this film. The character of Gabbar Singh is so creative that many film makers have tried to imitate him for their films.Sholay did for Indian Cinema what Casablanca did for Hollywood. It became an instant classic and broke all the rules of film making and characterization, while preserving the values of Indian cinema.Sholay just won the Filmfare Award (2005) for being the Best Film in the last 50 years of Indian Cinema. Sadly, when Sholay was first released in 1975 it didn't win any major Filmfare awards. But when you think about all the great films that were released in that year, its easy to see how it may have been over looked. 1975 may have been the best year for Hindi films with the likes of Deewar, Chupke Chupke, Hera Pheri, Khel Khel Mein, Julie, Mausam, Ponga Pandit, Rafoo Chakkar, Uljhan, Dharmatma, Do Jasoos, Faraar, Geet Gaata Chal, Chhoti Si Baat, Aandhi and Milli - all releasing along with Sholay.Sholay had the biggest star cast of its time with the likes of Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bhaduri, Sanjeev Kumar, Sachin, A.K. Hangal, Leela Mishra, Satyen Kappu, Mac Mohan, Jagdeep, Asrani, Helen, Jalal Agha, Iftekhar, Keshto Mukherjee and of course Amjad Khan. The Greatest Cast Ever Assembled for the Greatest Story Ever Told! 
SHOLAY..........the name says it all(BEST Hindi MOVIE EVER)	Mumbai, India	I am shocked seeing that the IMDb ratings for this classic is just 6.6. Why? Because the movie is strongly influenced from the Westerns? or It it isnt entertaining enough?The 2nd cant be true because the movie had everything: strong script strong direction excellent characters and performances good action,comedy,romance,friendship,etcIf the 1st is true then i feel sorry for the viewers because being influenced is not being copied.Besides there would remain only like 50-60 original scripts if counted correctly.I cannot find a single flaw in the movie which is my personal thinking and as it would be of true Hindi cinema fans.So people please judge the movie on its merits and not on something which is totally baseless.RATING:- *****/***** 
Superb!	Delhi, India	 This is one movie which is flawless. Great performances from everyone. The cast of the movie is just perfect. Gabbar's character remains indelibly etched on your mind once you've seen him in action. Amitabh is definitely one of the greatest actors of all times. His portrayal of a criminal with morals is all the way tops along with Brando's Vito Corleone. I think the part about cheating with false coin to save Viru's life (sacrificing his own) was a lovely storyteller's touch. 10 all the way! 
Everybody knows this is the Best Bollywood film ever made	London	Everybody knows this is the Best Bollywood film ever made. I am surprised that this films rating in IMDb is not 10 /10 that it deserves. If you ask any Bollywood genius about this movie, they will tell you its the Best film of all time. Its no. 1 in the top 100 Best Bollywood Movies Stardust magazine. This movie had all the elements to make a great movie. Great Acting, Great Dialouges, Great music, Violence, comedy, Romance, Emotions and Relationships (Friendship). It stars Bollywoods Greatest ever actor Amitabh Bchchan in a Powerhouse performance. Dharmendra in his Best film that Ive seen. Hema Malini is fantastic as the in famous fast talking Basanti. Jaya Bachchan is superb as the quiet widow. Amjad Khan steals the show as the legendary famous Villain Gabbar Singh. The other cast have done a decent job. This is the Greates Film Bollywood have released. Fullstop. 
Tumhara naam kya hai Basanti.	None	This is the greatest Indian movie ever made. Each dialogue, each scene, each song, each character is immortal. I have seen this movie at least 10 times and it does not fail to evoke deep emotions every time. From the very first train sequence, Gabbar Singh's entry, a father's plight after discovering his son's dead body and the final clash between good and evil, this movie is masterful story telling. Although Zanjeer created the angry young man image for Amitabh, this movie surely set him on the path to super stardom. This movie was so good that even Ramesh Sippy, the direcor, has since not been able to create a movie to match this one. 
one of the greatest movies ever made	Pennsylvania, US	this was, is and will be the epitome of movies made in Hindi. the total package was as complete as any movie can come in. soundtrack by R.D.Burman is one of the finest ever made in any cinema. the movie is based on the life of a police officer whose family is brutally murdered by a dacoit whom he had captures early in his career.wounded in the fight , he hires two small-time crooks to help him get his revenge.the cinematography, direction, sets, location, and above all the extraordinary performances by each and every actor in the movie makes it a visual and mental treat. a tight storyline, with just the right flow in the script. whew!!! the more i say the less it sounds. see it to believe it. 
western curry	Belgium	Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar), once a senior police officer, hires two small-time crooks, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jaidev (Amitabh Bachchan) to bring the dreaded dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) to him alive. Gabbar had been caught by the Thakur and sent to jail. He escaped soon after and had gunned down the Thakur's entire family barring the youngest daughter-in-law, Radha, who was away at the temple. In a violent rage, the Thakur rode unarmed to the ravines where Gabbar Singh reigned to confront him. Thinking humiliation a better revenge than death, the bandit hacked off the Thakur's arms. In the village, Veeru falls in love with the garrulous but winsome Basanti (Hema Malini), while the more serious Jaidev feels drawn to Radha. When Veeru goes late to a tryst with Basanti, he discovers she has been kidnapped by Gabbar's men. Walking into a trap, he is saved by Jaidev, who gives him cover to get Basanti away. Fatally wounded, Jaidev pretends he is mildly hurt, and sends Veeru away with Basanti. He manages to blow up a bridge and kill most of the bandits before he dies. Veeru comes back and corners Gabbar in the ravines, and is about to kill him when the Thakur arrives on the scene. He insists on fighting Gabbar alone, and hits out at Gabbar with his hobnailed shoes. Gabbar's life is saved only when the police arrive and remind the Thakur that he cannot take the law in his own hands. Veeru decides to leave Ramgarh, but in the empty compartment of the train he finds Basanti waiting for him.The Film Sholay became a legend, and by far the most successful film of its time, which ran for five consecutive years in a theater in Bombay. Often described as India's best known curry western, Sholay was 'patterned' on American spaghetti westerns but the addition of romance, comedy, and songs gave it the ambiance that one expects of a Hindi film. 
Movie well made	United States	This movie needs no introduction. This stands as the largest all-time grosser of Bollywood. Considering the fact that in that same year 1975 , there were several other movies that became hits later on and this movie faced a lot of competition from these movies. This is a multi-starrer, a trend in those days.Many dialogs in this movie became very popular in every home in India and this movie itself became a household word. Every major star in this movie has done an excellent job. The direction is very good , the photography flawless. The background music score is very apt, though it resembles the spaghetti western score.But in my opinion this movie only deserves 7 stars for the mere fact that this movie is a plagiarized though Indianized version of The Kurosawas Japanese classic  The Seven Samurai. The above is a well known fact but what is little known is the trivia that this movie also borrowed a lot of its powerful ingredients from the Gary Coopers classic High Noon. Another tit bit is that the movie Mera Gaon Mera Desh that was released a few years before was another inspiration for this movie Sholay. Though the movie Mera Gaon Mera Desh has taken after High Noon to a greater degree. Also, many scenes in this movie are influenced by the spaghetti western style of movie making.But all said and done a great movie and as they say it in Hindi Paisa Vasool.. certainly worth watching at least once. 
One of the truly great films ever made	London	 I have yet to come across anyone who has disliked this film; even people I know who dislike Indian films admit that Sholay is a truly great film. The reason is quite simple....the genres covered are universal, and the acting and direction is quite phenomenal. The characters are so brilliantly portrayed that one can sense their emotions within oneself. It has long been argued about who is the best actor in the film. Well for me, it is impossible to tell. Amjad Khan plays Gabbar Singh magnificently, but then again you have Amitabh as Jai, Dharmendra as Veeru, Hema Malini as Basanti and Sanjeev Kumar as Thakur Baldev Singh, all of who put in immaculate performances. How can one choose between them? To 'put the icing on the cake', Sholay also contains two of the greatest songs in Bollywood history(yeh dostee and jub koyee haseena root jaatee hai). When I first watched this film as a child, I was almost crying at the end. Even now when I watch it I find myself getting emotional. Yet there are parts in this film that make you laugh hysterically. So no matter what kind of films you like, this is definitely one to watch....it really is one of the truly great films ever made.  
Apex Success of the Silver Screen	None	Absolutely phenomenal success. Nearly 70% of Indian population has seen the movie at least once. If were to count people having seen more than once, number of hours watched of this movie crosses 14 billion hours!! Currency converted value, it has garnered nearly 150 million USD, plus equal amount is black market. All needed now is to have superb sound in 3D Surround, and this movie will fetch another 500 million USD, as Bollywood is getting much needed exposure to global consumers. I am very sure this movie will remain most watched movie in the cinema world for ever, as its charm has not vanished, at least in South Asian viewers. 
A Great Movie	United States	One thing that strikes most about this movie is the characterization. Millions of people still remember the characters in this movie. The plot is inspired from Seven Samurai but it is adapted well to the Indian backdrop. This movie was made at a time when bandits were not an extinct species. The plot is simple, Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) is a cop who arrests a notorious bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) only to gain his wrath. The bandit escapes and massacres Thakur's family and severs both his arms. Thakur hires two men, Veeru and Jay (played by Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan) to capture Gabbar.All the characters of this movie have left a mark on Indian cinema for a long time and will continue to remain so. Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Sanjeev Kumar, Jaya Bachchan and Hema Malini are all brilliant in the movie. But one man steals the show as the villain who is cunning, merciless and evil. Gabbar Singh's character was played by Amjad Khan and he is fantastic in the film. It is because of him that the movie became the greatest Indian film ever !! 10/10 
Best 10 Movies (and 11th too!)	United States	Best 10 MoviesPather Panchali, Bandini, Saaransh, Shole, Shakti, Anand, Awaara, Satya, Golmaal, Hera-Pheri.and 11th Shwas (Marathi Movie!)Basically, whether a person likes a movie or not is subjective. Still, there are certain guidelines to rate a movie. The subject of the movie (Pather Panchali, Bandini, Saaransh), the way it is presented (Awaara), production quality (that is why I discarded Andaaz apana apana), camera angles (Shole is best in this section but satya, aawaara are great too!), the dramatization of the subject (Shakti, Anand) are some of the elements that makes a movie great. Comedy is one of the hardest skill to acquire and perform. That is why I included Golmaal and Hera-Pheri. The seemingly easy subject are presented in such a hilarious ways that these movies definitely deserve accolades. Shwas is my personal favourite. It is a Marathi movie. And the story is about a grandfather and his 6 years old grandson, who is about to loose his eyesight due to rare cancer. 
A case study for management students.An outstanding creation, the movie made in 1975 has a timeless feel to it.	India	An outstanding creation, the movie made in 1975 has a timeless feel to it. one can watch it any day and still relate to it. each and every depiction in the movie is appropriate. it depicted the extremes of human emotions of the protagonist and antagonist, village life, its superstitions, the simple joys and sorrows of life. the pace of movie is fantastic. the dialogues are most apt for the situations and i wonder if there was any better dialogue possible for those characters. The cult status which has been attained by this movie is likely to make life difficult for someone who wishes to make a remake of this movie. comparisons are going to be very strong and purists would deal with a substandard replication very severely. This movie is the white demonstration of film making, a bouquet of excellent performances in acting and technical departments where the impact of the film is far greater than sum of impact of all departments. A case study for management students. 
One of the best movies ever made	India	Sholay is one of the best Indian movies ever made. Every cast fits the role to perfection be in Amitabh as Jay or Dharm as Veeru or Hasrani as the cop or ..... the list is never ending. A movie worth watching 100 times with some great stuff music from RD.Fights which are the best ever made in Indian history. The climax wonderful, the work excellent its got no flaws what so ever. This movie when aired on screens just keeps getting revenue. Even now it did.A movie which changed the life of Bachhan moving him to the no 1 spot from where on Bachan went on to become all time best. Sippy needs special admiration for remaking this western classic in a very special Indian way 
A Superhit Indian Western !!	Lahore, Pakistan	Undoubtedly, this mega movie is a milestone in the Bollywood filmography. The film has good characterization of vengeful roles, brilliant portrayal of tragic and terrifying sequences, as well captivating cinematography reminiscent of Hollywood western movies.This was the Indian motion picture which set the stage for a different type of movies, that is to say, action movies with vital ingredients of violence, not yet crafted by Indian producers/directors and unknown among the local audience.The full and befitting advantage of this sort/dimension of Indian cinema went to Amitabh Bachan (the Fighter/Angry Hero)and the inevitable looser was the then Super Star - romantic Rajesh Khanna who was very much unable to fit into or appropriately perform angry, violent and action studded sequences that happened to be the cry of those days.All said, the Indian Cinema moved from moral based drama to western styled Hollywood movies that was not the quintessential forte of Indian polity. You can say that the cinematic imagination transformed from the sublime to the crazy and temporal.Sholay is a very interesting movie directed by the same man who had just a couple of years ago directed Andaz - a very different family movie based on real-to-life social drama. All credits to Ramesh Sippy -the Trendsetter. 
Best Indian Film Ever	Dubai, United Arab Emirates	Excellent characterization, acting, scripting, directing, and cinematography all put together in this film brings out the best film ever made in India.The film story line is very simple, yet very interesting to watch. Acting and dialogs in this film hold a very high caliber according to various film aficionado's. The film is about two young men hired to stop a group of bandits in a small village.I especially recommend every film student to watch this film at least twice in order to grasp the tradition of quality film-making. Sholay has a winning formula which is rare to find in todays film-making.Watch it! SCORE: 10/10 
All-Time Indian Classic	India	Well, this movie speaks for itself. 'Sholay' is the quintessence of a very popular genre in Bollywood - Crime+Drama. Acting, Dialogues and Cinematography is impeccable. Regarding the plot - its novelty, people may argue that its a mixture of many Hollywood movies (of 'western' genre). I have seen most of those movies which are claimed to be the 'archetype' of this classic. It surely carries the hints of them but you should know that - to steal ideas from one source is 'plagiarism' but to steal from multiple sources is what is known as 'research' (no offense to researchers !). The Sholay crew did their groundwork and research and delivered a true MASTERPIECE.10/10 
a movie as great as this will never be made again..	Urbana, IL, USA	 This movie has everything. Awesome action, wit and humour in the dialogues, the greatest hero of indian cinema, the greatest villain of all times. It captured the imagination of every movie goer and even today mothers discipline their children by telling them about gabbar singh.. 
Indeed!! Greatest Story Ever Told.  Best Starcast Possible!!!	United States	I wish I could give 11 out of 10 to this movie. First of all let me tell you that I read the negative reviews for this movie too, and almost all of the negative reviews are from people who do not understand the Indian culture or Hindi Cinema.If you are comparing this movie to westerns, you are not doing justice to this movie or to the westerns or to yourself since you will not enjoy the the comparison.This movie has the most outstanding actors, singers, music directors, movie director, script writers, dialogues, characters and screenplay all packed in one movie. This may not happen ever again.Every single dialogue written and delivered has become a part of Indian culture, referenced millions of times over and over again. Even today in 2012, people reference each other with the names of characters (Gabbar, Thakur, Basanti, Jay, Veeru, Sambha) in certain situations or sometimes even without any reference. That is the kind of impact this movie has left on the entire nation. Amitabhs baritone voice and acting, Sanjeev Kumars dialogue and expressions, Hema Malinis constant nonsense talk, Jaya Bachchans silence, Dharmendras flamboyance, Last but not the least Amjad Khans evil laugh and evil expressions these are all unparalleled portions of the movie. Sanjeev Kumar and Amjad Khan were as if born for the roles of Thakur and Gabbar.R.D. Burman, the unmatched genius in music composition has given some superhit songs (Mehbooba, Yeh Dosti, Jab tak hai jaan). His voice in Mehbooba song is icing on the cake. Singers like Kishor Kumar and Manna Day provide the perfect voice to the beautifully written and composed song Yeh Dosti. The song sets the tone for Jays(Amitabh) and Veerus (Dharmendra) friendship, and the intensity remains throughout the movie even after Jay dies.The love story of the serious Jay and silent Radha is as intense as the love story of flamboyant Veeru and the chatterbox Basanti. Jays (Amitabh) dialogues with Basanti(Hema) provide moments of laughter, although none of the characters are laughing.Every single word, every single expression, every single music note, every single moment of silence in the movie has its place. None are wasted or seem out of place. Even the supporting characters like Soorma Bhopali, Jailer, Sambha, Imaam Sahaab, Kalia have all become famous characters and it is impossible to imagine the movie without these supporting characters. I could go on and on about this move for more than 3 hours, but I dont have enough words for this movie.I have watched it more than 100 times over the years. But you should watch it at least once. If you do not like this movie, then it would only be because of one of these reasons: 1) You dont understand Indian culture and/or Hindi language 2) You are comparing the movie with a western classic or 3) You need to get a life. 
SHOLAY The Worlds best Movie Ever made	None	Sholay is the ultimate movie, it has all emotions, action, comedy  romance. This is the only movie in which none of the big stars outshine the other, Sanjeev, Dharam, Amitabh, Hema, Jaya  Amjad. All excelled in their roles. People call it a western remake but the original had almost no emotions, no comedy, just a bland movie. Sholay cannot be compared to low films like DDLJ which had nothing properly made, there are 100s of Hindi movies which outclass DDLJ in every era. Sholays dialogues are still being told by the masses, it is the ultimate cult movie. The only black spot in the movie is Asranis (otherwise my favourite comedian) he plays a British period jailer, his comedy looks sick. Jagdeep was well limited with a small role otherwise he would have destroyed all the good work, I wonder when he acted well in which movie? Amitabhs timely comments  his conversation with Hemas mausi was superb. Amitabh fills the comedians role superbly. A must watch for all movie goers from all over the world, this proves the old Hindi movies were 1000s of times better than all the new age khans combined movies. P.S. Do not ever remake this Diamond Movie 
The Biggest thing of Bollywood	None	Lets accept the fact, even some great movies have their own flaws but that does not means that they are not great films. Sholay is the most profitable and biggest hit in Indian Cinema. It wont be an understatement if I say that Indian Cinema can be divided into time before Sholay and time after Sholay. Indian movies are basically protagonist based and rest of the characters are build around it but Sholay was different. Every character in the movie had its own life and its own fun. You come out of the hall even praising the antagonist or a very minor character like Surma bhopali whose screen presence was not more than 3 minutes. The film is a mass entertainer with all the elements of screen writing that are required in a hit film in abundance. Legends like Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Dharmendra, Hema Malini, Amjad Khan(who was not a star then) and other actors like A.K.Hangal, Jagdeep, Asrani, Keshto Mukherji left their marks on whatever role was given to them. Some say that the story is been lifted from Seven Samurais and Magnificent seven but it doesnt matter because when you will watch the movie you will find the treatment to be totally Indian as only the basic plot is taken from those movies which for me is not a crime. Coming this movie from master writer duo of Salim-Javed and hands of Director Ramesh Sippy, you just cant afford to miss this entertainer. Watch this because in India if you dont know Amitabh Bachchan or have watched Sholay then you have no right to call yourself Indian or visit India or talk about India. Watch Sholay and get the license. 
Greatest movie of all time	India	I cant believe this movie has a rating of only 7.6 here.We are talking about THE SHOLAY here. Perhaps the best Indian movie of all time.Everybody whether they are old or of new generation has this film at least once.Somebody even seen about 50 times.Me personally seen this 20 times.Every time i watch i get completely mesmerized by it.It has become a part of our culture.The character names or the incidents are used in our everyday lives.I bet there is not a single soul who does not know this film.It is beyond great.You cant describe such films.They have their own place from where you cant displace them.It is like a Dhruv Tara.As long as Indian film industry lives it will remain the numero uno film.As somebody said i quote indian films are divided in two parts 1]pre sholay 2]post sholay.Everything in this film is great. 
An Eastern Western	Tunbridge Wells, England	In the small Indian village of Ramgarh, a former policeman and wealthy landowner named Thakur Baldev Singh approaches Veeru and Jai, two petty criminals whom he has formerly arrested in the line of duty. He offers the two men 20,000 rupees, plus an official reward of 50,000 rupees, if they will track down and capture alive an infamous bandit named Gabbar Singh, against whom the Thakur (an Indian title roughly equivalent to Lord) has a particular reason for desiring revenge. The reason why the Thakur is so anxious for revenge on Gabbar will become clear later in the story. This plot line clearly shows the influence of the conventions of the Western. Yet in many other ways Sholay is a very different film from anything likely to be produced by the American (or for that matter the European) cinema. At over three hours in length, for example, it is much longer than the standard revenge Western. It is an example of what have become known in India as Masala films because they consist of a mixture of different elements- drama, comedy, romance, music- in the same way as the curry dish masala consists of a mixture of different spices. Judged by Western criteria, Sholay would seem like a very poor piece of film-making indeed. Not only is it insanely overlong, the various elements which make up the plot do not seem to gel together at all well. The main story is a dark, brooding tale of sadism, bloodshed and revenge, which recalls not only the conventions of the Western but also those of Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Yet this bloody tale is often interrupted by cheerful musical numbers, light-hearted scenes of romance and comic interludes. I know that Shakespearean tragedies did sometimes make use of so-called comic relief, but these scenes, like the porter scene in Macbeth or the gravedigger scene in Hamlet are generally characterised by a grim black humour, very different to the farcical slapstick on offer in Sholay. The scenes involving Veeru and Jais adventures in prison, or Veerus romance with his pretty but talkative girlfriend Basanti, or the gypsy dance sequence, seem quite incongruous when set side by side with the serious parts of this film. This is, moreover, more than just a question of incongruity. These frequent diversions also slow down the main action and prevent it from developing smoothly and coherently. And yet this is clearly not a film which is intended to be judged by Western criteria. I am not a great expert on Indian cinema, but it seems clear that the conventions of Indian film-making are quite different to those which prevail in the West. (Indeed, the difference seems greater than that between Western films and those from other parts of Asia, such as China and Japan). This is clear not only from the masala structure of the film but also from much of the acting, especially Sanjeev Kumars highly stylised, non-naturalistic portrayal of the Thakur. The film was not rated very highly when it came out; one critic described it as a dead ember (the literal meaning of sholay in Hindi), and it was, paradoxically, criticised for copying Western models too directly. Today, however, it is widely considered in India to be a classic. For this reason I find it a difficult film to review, and I have decided not to award it a mark out of ten, as such a mark would only reflect my own cultural background, a background very different from that of those who made the film and of those for whom it was intended. 
It still holds your interest	United States	Watched this one many times during 1975 to 1980. In the 90s watched it on VCR and now on DVD. Nothing matched the experience of watching on mint condition 70 mm print with 6 track stereo sound among 1200 fans in theater on the first day ( It came late to Madras on Dec 5th 1975). Only time I felt that it is not all original was when I watched the train scene of the English western and learnt the thrilling scenes and angles were carbon copy. Still for a Hindi movie at that time it was breath taking.After this many years I still enjoy ( remember the lines of this movie despite the fact that I dont speak Hindi ) . In fact my entire vocobulary of Hindi will have 80% for words spoken in this movie. For a 3hr 15 mins movie, not much was spoken.The alternate ending being shown now does not really matter anymore. It would have been a hit whichever way it ended. 
one of the best screenplays in Indian cinema	India	Thakur Baldev Singh (Sanjeev Kumar), once a senior police officer, hires two small-time crooks, Veeru (Dharmendra) and Jaidev (Amitabh Bachchan) to bring the dreaded dacoit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) to him alive. How Jai and Veeru plan to capture Gabbar Singh and bring him to Thakur forms the rest of the movie. In the village, Veeru falls in love with the garrulous but winsome Basanti (Hema Malini), while the more serious Jaidev feels drawn to Radha.Sholay had all the elements of a Western - rugged countryside (the film was shot in the rocky landscape of Ramnagaram a small village about 30 miles from Bangalore), bandits on horseback, fierce gun fights etc. Sholays phenomenal success can be attributed to perhaps the way it was able to blend the various items or masalas required in a Hindi film in exactly the right doses. Practically every scene, dialogue and even a small character was a highlight. Even Dhanno, the horse of the tangewali, Hema Malini is remembered till today! Every small character be it the Jailer (Asrani), Mausi (Leela Mishra) or Sambha (Mac Mohan) - they are etched in viewers minds.In India, Sholay is not just a movie... it is a legend. There are people in India who remember each and every character of the movie vividly even now - 31 years after it was first released !!! this is the beauty of the film. Every character is so well sketched. It is the highest grossing film of all time in India. It has earned about Rs. 2,134,500,000, equivalent to US $ 50 million, after adjusting for inflation. It ran for 286 weeks straight in one Mumbai theatre, the Minerva. Using sentences like Arre O Samba, Ab Tera Kya Hoga Kaaliya? mothers frightened their children with the name of Gabbar Singh. Sholay was loud, garish, but it had something which touched everyones heart. Shot in 70mm with stereophonic sound, Sholay was the ultimate big screen experience. It was Indias first film in 70 mm with stereophonic sound. Mention must be made of Dwarka Diwechas stunning camera-work and R.D. Burmans evocative background score, which help elevate the film even further. 
Once Upon a Time in Bangalore.	United States	The Indian filmmaker G.P. Sippy died last December at the age of 93. his son Ramesh directed this film, which remains the most famous Hindi-language movie and the biggest commercial success for Bollywood. If you want to watch one Bollywood film in his honor, this is it.This epic has everything. It has a magnificent Seven type story, but there are only two who come to save the village. They are thieves hired by a former policeman to capture the bandit leader.It is a spaghetti-western of sorts as there are plenty of horses, and shooting, and fights.It is a lavish musical with amazing color and costumes as the villagers really put on a show for their simple festival of colors.It has comedy, slapstick, romance (but NO kissing!), music, a little horror, almost continuous action, tragedy, and triumph. Like, I said, if you only see one Sippy production, this should be it. 
The Ultimate Indian Blockbuster	None	***SOME SPOILERS***** Sholay, directed by Ramesh Sippy in 1975, remains the most successful Hindi (perhaps Indian) film ever made. While a couple of films have made more money and recently Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge surpassed Sholay's unprecedented 5 year run at Minerva Theatre in Bombay, Sholay leads by dint of the sheer impact it made on not just Indian cinema, but popular culture in general. The film is a loose adaptation of the Magnificent Seven (itself based on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai) and borrows freely from other movies - Hollywood or Indian. However, its adaptation is uniquely Indian and it remains, to my mind, immeasurably superior to the movies it is based upon. The story is about two crooks, Jai and Veeru, in rural central India - a region ravaged by dacoits (outlaws) - who are hired by a village landlord, Thakur to catch Gabbar Singh- a notorious outlaw - alive. Jai is the quiet reflective crook, while Veeru is loud, boisterous, impetuous, and a lothario to boot. Veeru falls in love with Basanti - a garrulous taangewali (horsecart driver) while Jai silently wooes the Thakur's widowed daughter-in-law, Radha. ******SPOILER ALERT*****SKIP THIS SECTION IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIEIt appears that Gabbar had been arrested by the Thakur while the latter was a police inspector and had exacted revenge upon escaping jail by massacring the Thakur's family. The Thakur's attempt at evening scores was met by capture and by the chopping off of his arms in a chilling scene. Hence, the need for mercenaries.****SPOILER OVER****Getting the bandit and the eventual shootout is the climax of the film, but it is greater than the sum of its parts. Each character, including minor ones like the jailer, the braggart lumber merchant (Surma Bhopali), the Maulvi, the family servant, have been well fleshed out and have significant parts - at the very least they entertain. The script tends to meander, but Sholay was not meant to be a simple revenge film - it conveyed a larger picture of villages, the dacoit menace so real then and even now.The film was shot in South India at Ramnagram rather than at the place where it was set (central India) but the stark, rugged scenery was worth it. As the first 70mm film in India and the first to use stereophonic sound, Sholay secured a place in Indian film history.Its success derives from a good script which does not allow for a dull moment (full marks to Salim-Javed for doing this), excellent direction and editing and excellent cinematography.While the film was fairly violent it was characteristic of its period. Its legacy however, is the dialogues of the major characters which the producers were able to sell as a separate LP record in 1975 - a first in Indian cinema. A generation later, most Indians who know Hindi understand Kitne Aadmi the? Loha Lohe ko Kat taa hai Tera Kyaa Hoga Kaalia - so much so that these dialogues have entered the lexicon and are frequently used in commercials.RD Burman's music was a big plus with a fantastic score and even better background music. Indeed the background music from the faux Western theme music to music that announced major characters like Gabbar Singh is recognized even after three decades.Sholay made the career of Gabbar Singh as the first psychopath on the big screen ( though some might argue that Danny Denzongpa had essayed that in Dhund) in India, though he could never get a comparable role later. Sanjeev Kumar's controlled rage as the Thakur was a close second performance. Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan were very good with both exhibiting comedy especially in the water tank scene, though Hema Malini was a bit over the top. The supporting cast of Asrani (jailor), Surma Bhopali (Lumber merchant) and others were very good.A must see that seems to transcend time. I am obviously biased but years of screening this film for international as well as Indian audiences have convinced me of its worldwide appeal. 
one of the best Indian landmark movies	Egypt	a landmark movie and one of the best.i give it 10 out of 10.i also want to say that this movie is not a remake and the plot is original. and any American who says that it is a remake then he is rude and a dirty liar because it is just inspired by other western movies and this movie is an Indian western that is much better than any American western because the Indian actors and actresses have true and warm emotions that the American actors and actresses don't have. it was directed with an unmatched excellence.i recommend it very much to everyone.it is such a wonderful movie.a true masterpiece. 
Assessment of film	India	TIt is a landmark film being the first ever 7o m.m film.made in India.Adapting a Western film theme to Indian Conditions is a remarkable achievement and the gun -weilding action scenes remind One of the Sergi Leone Spaghetti Westerns like 'A Few Dollars More.The Cinematography is classical.What demarcates this film from an average one is the classical direction. The way scenes showing the Thakur's arms being amputated by Gabbar,the Thakur's grandson being shot by Gabbar and Ahmed ,the village boy being tortured to death are effectively cut reveal this aspect.The way Gabbbar Singh is introduced is classical where he is shown walking on the rocks revealing only his legs .However there are contradictory aspects in the film's script like a Thakur defending the lives of the village peasants(Traditionally Thakurs were landlords who terrorised the peasants)and 2 urban based gangsters wishing to settle down in a village.Sholay falls marginally short of a classic like Mughal -E-Azam.It does not relate to Social reality as films like Mother India'or Do Bhiga Zameen' nor has the philosophical depth of films like 'Pyaasa' or 'Mera Naam Joker'.That does not deny that it is the best film of it's type ever made in India and it's impact on the Indian psyche has been unparalleled in the history of Indian Cinema.The acting of Amjad Khan and Sanjeev Kumar are displays of true genius.There is also a moral aspect to the film unlike the Italian Spaggheti westerns of the 1960's.By Harsh Thakor 
greatest movie ever made	india	 this possibly is the GREATEST movie ever made. The story, screenplay, cinematography, Direction, action is all top class. THe movie made with primitive equipment has withstood the test of time and probably will rule the minds of generations to come. It will be an understatement to say that sholay is a cult movie cause it is much more than that. It is a statement on the times(the '70s) and is the greatest cast ever assembled and the best technicians ever assembled. And for all the sholay connieuers the book on making of sholay is a must read. The director has to take the credit for backing such a monumental work and carrying it off brilliantly. Interestingly except for 1 award the film did not get any filmfares or critical acclaim but the movie still rules the hearts of millions of fanatics.  
The Greatest Entertaining Film of Highest Quality	Bombay, India	 The Best Star Cast.. The Best Background Music.. Best Direction... Best Script... Best Photography... Best Location... Best Performances... Best Debut of a Villain... Best Action...The Movie Has Action, Comedy, Drama, Tragedy and everything else which together combine to form the best commercial Indian film ever made for mass consumption... 
Was the success of Sholay  rely on Gabbar Singh character by Amjad Khan?	Malaysia	Lets talk about Sholay! The moment Sholay is mentioned, honestly the first thing comes into our mind is the Gabbar Singh with his popular dialog which is remembered until today. I would like to recommend that Sholay was a big hit just because of Gabbar Singh character. There are thousands of movie had been made and non has the Gabbar Singh villain type of quality in it. Fair enough, each character was good in the movie, but i will still stand for the Gabbar character which was wonderfully acted by late Amjad Khan. If the character were to act by some other famous villain of that time, its possible that the film have will some credits definitely, but not as what it achieved by taking Amjad Khan.Secondly, the character of Thakur Baldev Singh was the second reason's of the success. The other characters of the film has also contributed to the success of the film. The pair of Jay and Veeru was truly spirits of DOSTI. Basanti was just marvelous. Jaya was good and also Satyen Kapuu. Asrani and Jagdeep was real humorous.Their jokes are remembered until today. The Imaam Saab and the Azan scenes, touches millions hearts.The ever fear introduction of Gabbar Singh with the thrilling back ground music are the best entry of a villain ever seen of any Hindi movie.The song Yeh Dosti, Ha Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Mehbooba Mehbooba are the most popular song of the movie. RD.Burman gives great music to the film. Kader Khan - best dialog, Salim Javed - best story and script, Veeru Dev Gun - best action, Ramesh Sippy - Best Direction and all those who was involved in the film has done a very good job ever.Sad that the film was not awarded even millions have watched the film over and over again. It was blockbuster during it time and well remain ever-green movie!Finally, a complete, good and best film ever made and its impossible that there will be any other film which will be able to over take G.P Sippy SHOLAY from the main chart. Never!A film that should not been miss and worth watching. Aur Film Kab Hain? Kab Hain?................. Syaabas!!! 
this is a must see movie	Birmingham	 if you ever want 2 watch an hindi movie it must be sholay, you cant go wrong with thid movie it has comedy, romance, tragedy, action,western and it is musical aswell. it has one of the best bollywood heros which is BIG B and it has a good villian, amjad khan, (decaesed). once  you have seen this film you will want to watch it again. It is about two brave theives who are best freinds  (big b and dharmendrah) who get arrested by a policeman (sanjeev kumar). some bandits attack them , the two theives risked their own lives to save the policeman. many years later he needs the help of the two theives to capture a bandit. 
THE BEST EVER	Mumbai, India	 This is unarguably the best Hindi movie of all times till date. It arrests your atention even after 26 years it was released. Each time you see the movie, you find newer things to admire. Its just too good.It is THE MOVIE you are guaranteed to enjoy for unlimited number of times. 
Entertainment, Entertainment, Entertainment	India	I dont know from where to start. Sholay is a perfect blending of all spices and makes it a delicious curry which you want to have again and again. It has Emotion , Drama , Romance , Action, and what not , you name it and this movie has it. Though a little lengthy, but one wont mind as it never ceases to entertain at any point of time. I dont reckon a single movie where every character becomes legend irrespective of their screen presence.This movie works on concept of 3Es which is Entertainment, Entertainment, Entertainment and makes it an epic. I am short of adjectives for this movie. Mesmerising at its best, flawless , perfect etc. etc.If you havent watched it , do yourself a favor and add it your bucket list. I am sure you will regret it for not having it watched earlier. 
how good is it?..... Damn man, its the epic we are talking about	India	Yeah Sholay or amber draws its cinematography from western spaghetti movie genre but this movie is a epic in its own respect. Amazingly multi layered, multi styled, multi varied yet singly packed this film is one blasting bomb of cinema.If you loved Once upon a time in west, the good the bad and the ugly then this movie is a step cohesive with them in a whole different style and still packed with much more enriching entertainment and music that cant be forgotten in many centuries. Number of attempts have been made to make a successful western styled movie where movies like unforgiven failed (though they win Oscar when they dont have much competition that year and were made in the USA) but nothing and never will any movie be made that can invoke this style and make a huge lot of progress in its shot.Masala film is the nick name given to its effect because this movie provides you with one of the best tonic of involvement and entertainment. Extremely well-made, beautifully edited, amazingly written, melodiously sung, damningly acted and truly evolved , Sholay is a movie for human beings. 
Nice movie!	India	The 3D version of this all-time classic should work for two reasons: One, the simplicity on display, when one compares it with the recent releases that are infested with VFX. Two, the invigorating and revitalizing drama writers: Salim-Javed that leaves you awestruck, even though you may have lost count of the number of times youve watched this incredible entertainer. With 3D, every pivotal character stands out quite literally in the film. On the whole, there are films and there is SHOLAY. Frankly, it would be sacrilegious to miss this classic. Watch it. Now.The 3D conversion couldve been more polished for a film of this stature. Still, the effect is spellbinding. The train sequence still the best train sequence ever shot in Hindi cinema is the highlight  new effects have been added to enhance the 3D element. With a length of over 3 hours, the 3D gets tiresome in parts but the sheer grandeur of the film keeps you going. Indias epic adventure is back  rush to the screens now! 
Reviewing the 2014 3D theatrical version for now	None	Some of the most pathetic conversion from 2D-3D available on screen, that puts the shoddy Clash of the Titans on a pedestal for how to do things. The wonderful original background score has also been screwed-with (thankfully, not to a great extent) by someone called Raju Singh. Atmos sound works most of the time. Better viewed in 2D, and I shall remedy the mistake when/if I get the chance, though Id have to live with the screwed-over score in any case (I think).Having said that, the audience members who watched this one when I did, had the following attributes: 1. Intent in capturing selfies during the movies running time. Cams pointed right at the audience as well, flashes going off to the tune of 5-10 occasions every half hour. 2. Babies, who (obviously) brought the house down with the (oh so pleasant) screaming when Atmos accentuated every gunshot, every death-scream, and every swear word. 3. Cam phones once again, being used by geniuses to take snaps of the (3D) images on screen. Wait, theres more... 4. Cacophonous laughs and jeers at every quite moment, some of which were romantic, most of which were tragic/poignant. Same batch of geniuses (see above) joining in, with quite a few followers to boot......Now, in spite of not blowing a blood vessel at all that (quite used to putting up with, nee living with, said geniuses that populate most cinemas, including multiplexes), I confess to having not felt bored even during (what I consider the weakest element of this masterpiece) those interminable flashbacks, and dated-looking/sounding/seeming scenarios on display. The performances are still top-notch, the music plays a huge role (the not-too-destroyed RDB-original score during the train sequence being a case-in-point - the rest having been butchered by Raju Singh). All-in-all, I do hope someone coverts this for IMAX (hopefully, without the 3D), or someone updates the 3D sometime, even with crowd-funding, if thats an option. Still, this compares well against most of the other trash playing, and being appreciated, out there. 
the best Hindi film. my all time fave.	India	This movie is just the best movie i have seen. (Its my favorite movie).It has all the elements that a good movie must have: Excellent Dialogues.Excellent Music.Excellent Acting. (Even the extras where excellent) Excellent Story/Plot.Cant find a single flaw in the movie. Probably one of the best ever made in Hindi. The camera work is flawless and grips you. The acting is inspired. The music is memorable. One of the movies you remember for life. one of the greatest Hindi ever made !As a strong fan of the American Western genre and of course the directing of Sergio Leone, it is with great enthusiasm that i recommend Sholay to any audiences or fans of Westerns and Bollywood cinema.Perhaps, the greatest film in the history of Bollywood cinema (with one of the longest theatrical runs in Bollywood history), this is the definitive Bollywood action epic movie in the same way that Leones The Good, The Bad  The Ugly was the definitive Western.The film features the acting talents of such Bollywood legends...Amitabh Bachan and Dharmendra and focuses at its heart, a story of friendship, courage and revenge, based loosely around the concepts of Akira Kurosawas Seven Samurai  The Magnificent Seven.If you have not watched it, then make it your priority to watch it at least once in your life, as this is definitely one of the movies that every person needs to experience.A true cinematic masterpiece. 
An all time best movie!	India	I have seen this movie myself many times and I loved it. The main reason why this movie is considered the one of the best in Bollywood is the time in which it was made. It was made during the 70s where blockbuster movies were in much much more demand than critically acclaimed ones. This movie combined the effects of both. It has an engaging and nice plot with a bit of suspense , romance , comedy , plenty of action , brilliant music , superb acting and some moral lessons(SOME). Its excellent dialogues have become very popular in India where the majority of the population is aware of them and you can say that an Indian movie goer comes to age by watching this movie [ and a few others such as Mother India , 3 idiots , etc]. This is a must watch movie in my opinion. People of today may not like it so much but if you some other movies of the 70s , go back a little in time to the India in the 70s and perhaps you will simply fall in love with the movie. 
Movie of a LifeTime	United States	All in all a complete movie consisting of Wonderful Action, Drama, Best Comedy, Great music, awesome screenplay, excellent camera work, Superb Star Cast, well directed, extremely well acted , well scripted dialogs and I am sure many more things.From the start till the end it was very well narrated. Sanjeev Kumar, Amitabh , Dharmendra, Hema Malini and Gabbar Singh by Amjad Khan have done more than justice to their role by performing extremely well. RD Burman has scored a great music and writer Duo Salim Javed have done an excellent work in terms of Story  Dialogs.To conclude, The Best movie ever made in Bollywood by far. 
All Time Favorite	Bahrain	Sholay,directed by Ramesh Sippy is an all time favorite of mine.It has a story,it has great actors,good music,memorable scenes,superb dialogs.What else would you want? There is not even a single scene which puts you off.Direction by Ramesh Sippy is truly masterpiece.The music is very good.The dialogs are superb.Especially the ones delivered by Gabbar Singh.The story is well written.Performance wise-Even though the main actor is Dharmendra and Amitabh Bachchan.Amjad Khan steals the show.He is excellent!Dharmendra is great.Amitabh Bachchan is superb.Sanjeev Kumar is amazing.Hema Malini is cute.Jaya Badhuri is good.Jagdeep is funny.Overall Sholay is a Classic. 
The perfect movie of bollywood that contains everything	India	Now what can I say about this one?This is the best movie bollywood could ever produce;everything is just perfect about this film--it contains action,romance,suspense,comedy,great acting,beautiful songs,unforgettable characters and dialogues and what not!Even after so many years,its craze remains the same.One surprising thing is that when the film was released,it was considered to be just another average film,it also didnt received many awards or nominations..just when the theaters were going to stop showing it,people were seen in great queues outside the cinema-halls!Suddenly there were rush towards the theaters,and it unexpectedly became so big a hit that it became the first ever bollywood film to observe a silver jubilee!I recommend this film very very much;thogh would also like to mention that people not connected to Indian culture,or people who doesnt know much of it,might find it not so magical..I see some people are considering the comic scenes total nonsense,but without them(surma bhopali and jailer scenes) the movie seems incomplete to me.Here at IMDb,people who hate this film says all the songs but mehbooba mehbooba are bogus!I strongly disagree to that and think they only tell so because songs other than mehbooba mehbooba have Indian tunes in them.Just see this film and you will be wondered to discover no matter how many times you watch this;watching it over and over again will never tire you!
