The best Hindi comedy ever made!	Sydney Australia	 There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens to be one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to outwit each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is well paced and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only film!). Unfortunately it did not succeed at the box-office, and we might never see a film of this calibre again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proved his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dim-wit. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant/friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the flavour of the film! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they make more quality films like this one. You will want to watch this film time and again.P.S - For those of you who have watched this film, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (old and new), etc. 
Funniest Indian movie of all time.	New York	 This movie is simply excellent. For some reason it wasn't a success at the box office in India. In New York, however, I have yet to come across a person who disliked this movie. This is definitely the funniest movie to come out of India.  Everyone gives a good performance; Amir Khan; however, just takes over and puts the movie over the top. 
Best Indian comedy of the Khan era!	Chicago, IL	 It's simply ridiculous how underrated this movie is. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. It never lags, it never slows down, it is a movie that has a wonderful flow to the plot. That along with the brilliant writing makes this an awesome movie. Aamir and Salman are outrageous, even Raveena and Karishma are funny in this movie. Paresh Rawal and Shakti deliver some great bad guy comedy, but Viju Khote and the Ajit-wannabe are the best with their dumbfounded bad-guy intentions. If you want to laugh, and enjoy a movie, watch this movie, do it with family or friends, you will not regret it. Most indian movies tire me out by the end, cause they are 3 hours long. This movie is just as long, but I wish there was more when it ends, cause it's an amazing flick. 
funniest movie of the century	Rochester, US	 There are some movies that are loved by almost everyone who you come across and yet happen to be  box-office failures. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls in that catogory. For once, an Indian director has kept in mind the sensibilities of the audience, and not churned out a Kader Khan type stereo-typical hoax. The movie is about two guys who dream of riches, and try to accomplish that by wooing a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while a lot of complexities surface in the story. The complexities add to the sheer comedy of the entire plot. Aamir Khan plays the a street-smart guy, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the dumb guy. The villian played by Paresh Rawal,and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and Kaliaa make you laugh in your sleep. Although the movie borrows from a lot of other movies, despite shoddy camerawork, and despite being loud at times, it remains one of the scarce funny movies Bombay has come up with after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. It is sad that it didn't do well at the box-office, for that means producers turn back to formulas and creativity is abandoned. 
One of the best comedy movie of all times..	Belgium	Its a very good comedy movie.Ijust liked it.I don't know why i love this movie i just love it.Storyline:It is a story of two boys Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) who want to get rich quickly by taking all the short-cuts in the book. Amar is the son of an honest barber, Murli Manohar (Deven Verma) in Mumbai, while Prem is the son of Bankeylal Bhopali (Jagdeep), a hardworking tailor in Bhopal. Both Amar and Prem sell their father's shop and house respectively, and zero in on a hill station where a beautiful wealthy heiress Raveena (Raveena Tandon) has come from London accompanied by her friend cum secretary Karishma (Karishma Kapoor) with the intention of getting married to a virtuous Indian. The lucky man to wed Raveena will inherit her father Ram Gopal Bajaj's (Paresh Rawal) entire wealth. Amar and Prem see their get rich quick chance and woo Raveena, each trying to out do the other. Enter Teja (Paresh Rawal in a double role) whose sole ambition in life has been to grab his twin brother Ram Gopal Bajaj's millions. So Teja plants Bhalla. (Shehzad) and Robert (Vijoo Khote) in Raveena's house, to help him in fulfill his ambition. As the story progresses it turns out to be a mad chase from Ram Gopal Bajaj's wealth, full of humor, romance thrills and chills. Will Raveena & Karishma see through Amar and Prem's mischievous intentions? Will Teja succeed in his motives? See it all in super comedy ANDAZ APNA APNA. Aamir,Salman,Raveena,Karishma and Paresh at there best.Good Music.Good Direction.Good Story and Screenplay.and very good Comedy !!!!!! 
This comedy has a script !!!	India	Its a spoof, its an intelligent comedy, it has some a pathetic action and choreography (and mind it, it is intentional), good hummable songs, good performances by the entire cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh and over all an script which is so rare in Indian cinema that too in comedy (watch David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra etc). Story is of two wastrels whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways. They come across one such way when they find out that a rich NRI is coming India to get married. Rest of the story is about oneupmanship and how these wastrels try to out wit each other. Entire cast is perfectly cast right from Deven Verma till Viju Khote. Songs are rightly placed and are funny. Surprise package is Salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy.All an all a fum film which you should not ignore if you like and watch Indian Cinema. 
One of the funniest movies in the last few decades. MUST SEE!	Boston	 Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, first being Namak Halal (even though that was technically a drama). Story is nothing groundbreaking, but the complications that are added to it make it awesome. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just watch his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is amazingly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat dimmer of the two characters. The noises he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces. Raveena and karisma serve their purpose but are nothing amazing. The real pick of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual.The plot is rather simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They don't believe in hard work and just want to get rich the easy way. So both their brains come across an idea to woo a rich man's (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) who comes to India to look for a husband. So Amar and Prem meet on the trip and join hands to drive off the hundreds of other men trying to marry this girl. When they succeed, they now have to get rid of each other. Somehow both of them get into Raveena's house, Amar as an injured guy and Prem as his doctor. From here on they try to oust each other. But things are complicated as Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls for Prem and pursues him. And rich man's evil twin brother (Rawal also) tries to get rid of the heiress and her father so he will inherit the money and sends in his two most trusted but bumbling fools to do the dirty work.This is a movie you do not want to miss. Watch it! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, its that good. And if you like this movie, I'd also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't already watched it. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new). 
Best Indian Comedy Ever!!!!!!!!	United Kingdom	This is my favourite Indian movie of all time. It is comic genius. Salman Khan is hilarious. But Amir Khan steals the show with his witty dialogue. Karisma Kapoors outfits tell a story of their own - makes you wonder if the stylist deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier (at one point she looks like shes wearing a nappy). Andaz Apna Apna is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end. There is not one dull moment, every scene is hilarious, even the songs and dance moves will have you in stitches of laughter. I especially loved the scene in which Amar (Amir Khan) regains his memory. Ive seen this movie so many times Ive lost count. And Im so glad to say that this time Bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as I know A.A.A it is not a replicate of a Hollywood movie (THANK GOD). Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who understands Hindi/ Urdu and loves good comedy.Watch it youll love it!!!!! 
Most Comic movie in Recent times	India	 Andaaz Apna Apna is the most comic movie of the decade.You can't stop laughing during the movie.Right from the first scene to the last, your giggles don't stop.Amir Khan is brilliant.His comic timing is superb.His dialogue delivery, gestures,uninhibited style all compel you to laugh like hell.Salman Khan is good.Paresh Rawal is his usual best.The dialogues by Rajkumar Santoshi are good(Amir Khan mouthing Purush-Mahapurush).The music reminds you of good old times.The scenes where both the characters Amar Prem try to outwit each other,they try to woo Raveena and the fighting scenes in the Climax are really funny.It is very difficult to decide which is the most comic scene.All of them are on top of other.Definitely one of the best feathers in RajKumar Santoshi's Cap. I think this movie ranks no.1 in Comedy genre of Bollywood(at least in 1990s when there were very few comedy movies).  
Best Indian Movie Ever	Sydney	 i have been watching this movie repeatedly, since it came out. even though it is 8 years old now, it still cracks me up. the jokes are still hilarious and the way the characters are portrayed will make anybody of any age laugh like they've never laughed before. Enjoy it 
Hilarious...	England	 It'll soon be 10 yrs since this movie was released....still makes me laugh.... If u enjoy this film, try the new Hera Pheri....t'is as hilarious. And my favourite bit of the film must be when Salman realises that he has no bullets left in his gun while he has the upper hand and has everyone at gun point...and he actually says it out loud!!! U just wanna bash him....but u know u can only do that if u stop laughing!!!! Fantastic film.... 10/10 
One of the best comedy movie ever made in Bollywood	India	The movie Andaz Apna Apna in my books is the top 5 intelligent comedy movies ever made in Bollywood perhaps even Hollywood. When the movie released i was a 8 year old and I heard it was a flop but I never understood till now why was it a flop...but let me tell you one thing...this movie would have more money by selling home Cassettes and DVDs and by showing in TV movie channels than any hit movie in theaters. This movie has been shown countless times in Movie channels and I think even now the public love and the TV producers keep repeating the movie again and again. I personally have watched the entire movie more than 80 -100 times and I still love it.....The performance by both Aamir khan as Amar and Salman khan as Prem is mind blowing but i especially liked the performance of Aamir khan as a street smart guy....his dialogs in the movie are Hilarious... the story is simple and heres how it goes.....Amar and Prem are poor , lazy chaps and come from a poor family of tailors and Amars father is a barber. Then they both get a news that a Millionaire s daughter from London is coming to India to look for a suitable match ...both Amar and Prem think that this is a brilliant opportunity to become super rich.....therefore they both head out to woo Raveena Tandon..(the millionaires daughter)......in their journey they both hate each other and each one of them try to fool the other in order to marry Raveena.....the comedy scenes in between are so hilarious that you would need a glass of water to stop the pain in your stomach by laughing.......and then there is Raveenas Uncle (Millionaires look alike brother) Teja who wants to take revenge from Raveenas father.....since he is broke and Raveenas dad is a millionaire......his plans include kidnapping Raveena to blackmail Raveenas dad for which he hires 2 butlers.....but later on we get to know that there is a twist in the movie (watch the movie to know).......then there is Shakti Kapoor as crime master Gogo who is also incredibly funny......The thing which stood out for me were the dialogs in the movie which has become a legend of sorts.....Aamir khan uses his aaila  brilliantly and Salman goes like OOima ........and for Gogo there is  Jab Raat Ko Bacha Soota Nahi Hain to Ma Bolti Hain Ki Sooja Nahi to Gogo Aa Jaega ......each and every scene is so funny......I especially liked the one in which Aamir khan and Salman goto get Raveena from Teja and they both go in a Luna having chillar money in a bag....that scene is so funny..I recommend anyone who understands Hindi or Urdu to watch this movie ......this is one movie that I would recommend having a DVD and you will never regret....... 
Brilliantly Marvellous	India	Andaz Apna Apna is a movie that I treasure and its one movie, I dont mind seeing at any time... well almost any time! This movie is simply marvelous and according to me, is the funniest movie Ive ever seen! And yes, I do put it over Hera Pheri... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes youll watch out but Andaz Apna Apna? Not possible! Simply because every scene is a scene you got to watch out for! Aamir & Salman share great chemistry and are perfect in their shoes but Ill put the characters in order of favoritism: Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoors best performance till date and yes, this happened before the casting couch): Gogo is an innocent character who belongs to well reputed family of Mogambo (Mr. India fame). Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambos nephew but for Mogambo, hes more than a responsible, handsome, charismatic charming son. Gogo, makes the biggest mistake of life by lending 36,000 rupees to Teja (who is as Balla had once said, A Fraud and a Cheat!). Now, Gogos only goal is to get back whats his and in his journey of recovering his lost money, Gogo realizes that there is more than 36,000 that he needs to achieve and thus begins... Gogos struggle against the sinner-world.Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal Bajajs twin. Originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, Teja chooses to change his name to suit his personality. Teja, as a child had always envied his brother and then one day, things took a turn for the worse when his father gave his entire wealth to Ram Bajaj. Teja decided to kill his father but in the nights darkness, instead killed Munshi Harish Chandra (Raveenas Dad), though Teja doesnt regret his actions. Tejas sole mission, now, is to get back his property somehow and start his own Poultry & Bakery Farm. Teja also needs to return back the loan to Gogo (but has no intentions whatsoever to do so). In order to achieve his evil goals, Teja employs two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at aiming) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajits clone and son... who is a very very smart boy!) Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): Wants to marry the rich heiress Raveena, so he sells his fathers cheap saloon and heads off for Mumbai. Amar, has no problem taking care of the big business that Raveenas father will hand him over after their wedding and is willing to sacrifice his happiness and shift to London, if needed.Rank # 4. Prem (Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie and the way Amar tries to take advantage of him in the mask of a friend, is tragic.I wont reveal any more characters because Jesus Christ! I just wouldnt stop typing! The movie is outright stunning! Go and get the DVD now and beware of those cheap VCDs as they have omitted many good scenes out of the movie.The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final encountered between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it appears in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teach us a lot about life and values and ethics. It teaches us about bravery (why else would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they go to meet the kidnapper, even though Prem was complaining that he had to go to the toilet???). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the scenes where Salman is targeted by Aamir and is given overdose of stomach-upsetting pills, the part where Teja reveals his sad feelings regarding why he couldnt go to London and the part where Gogo is arrested in the ending, without even getting back his 36,000. Andaz Apna Apna is overall a complete package.... sit back and enjoy the ride! Bet therell be a second ride after that... and then a third!The movie was considered a flop back then and I bet no one liked it but buckle up guys! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didnt have enough people coming to theatres, the movie is one of the highest selling Home DVDs and one of the most frequently movie on most of the channels so the producers have laughed their way to the banks long time back! 
Such Comedies r made once in 10 Years	India	Well to start with Rajkumar Santoshi is not a comedy film maker ,and this is really unfortunate because the only comedy film he has made is a masterpiece.This film is really funny .Loud in bits ,overacted in a few scenes but still the dialogues r really laugh riots and characters r really full of fun . Story line in simple a Billionaires daughter come to India for marriage and Two young chaps r behind her ,the story has a twist as well with a connection of a Gangster .Aamir playing a street smart guy Amar has played his role with brilliance and Salman has played the role of an innocent stupid to perfection.Raveena has done fine ,but Karshima really turns irritating in some sequences .But real show stealer r Paresh Rawal and Shakti Kapoor ,they enter the frame and automatically u start laughing . Overall such an enjoyable film that u can watch it any no. of times without getting bored. 
Ha..ha..haaa.haa..	Dubai, U.A.E.	 This movie is an amazing comedy.. the script is too funny.. if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more. Though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh!! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan have given justice to their roles. After 1994 i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this. 
Amazingly funny	Boston, MA	 I find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating. It is arguably one of the best comedies ever made, and surely the best Bollywood comedy of the 90s. The film did not do too well on the box office and people had diametrically opposite reactions after seeing it. My guess is most people didn't expect it to be an all-out comedy and were expecting a regular movie. If you love comedies, this is a must-see. And Aamir Khan is outstanding. 
This is the best out-and-out hindi comedy	San Francisco	 I would say that this is the best out-and-out hindi comedy movie of our times. All the characters especially Mogambo Ka Bhateeja , Bhalla and above all Teja are absolutely hilarious. Aamir Khan & Salman Khan are also cool. With rib-tickling dialogues by Rajkumar Santoshi, this is a MUST-SEE , especially for those within 15-30 age group. 
a hilariously funny movie!	None	 a hilariously funny movie!   of course u gotta have a sense of humour to be able to appreciate it. the music is excellent, reminded me of 50-60's hindi music which is a rarity nowadays... worth the $$$!  go check it out :) 
Undoubtedly a classic that deserved better in the box-office	United States	I watched this movie probably more than 20 times. The jokes are now 10-15 years old but every time I watch it it makes me fall off my chair. Two of the finest actor Salman Khan and Aamir Khan plays the lead roles here. Even if Aamir Khan is a much better actor and got the better role(smart guy) in the movie Salman Khan matches and sometimes perform even better as the dumb guy. All the characters are memorable. This movie is filled with hilarious one-liners and funny situations(a little too silly probably). Dont try to look for logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for some time. I promise it will be an experience to remember. 
good comedy	Baltimore, US	 I have seen this movie today. It is the funniest movie i have ever seen. It is mostly based on comedy of errors. I liked paresh rawal's performance. Raj kumar santoshi's,perhaps, the only comedy movie is this. I like his movies. I would give 4 out of 5. 
AAILA!--A lots of background things to look for as well.	london	 I must have watched this movie 20-30 times, and can still enjoy watching it.Apart from the great performances, the situations and the characters, what makes this movie really great for me are the subtle events in the background at times. That makes it interesting each time you watch it.For instance, there is this scene when Amir meets some Union leader, and takes his cigerette to light up a Bidi, lights the Bidi, and returns the Bidi to the other guy, and keeps the cigerette with him!There are so many more funny and subtle adsurdities going on throughout the movie.. The only portion I keep on fast-forwarding even now, is the song in the bus.. I think although the movie was a flop on the box-office, it still is a huge hit in the home rentals, although large scale piracy would have meant that the producers didn't really earn much from it.  
Hilarious Hindi Film	United States	I love this film. Shehzad Khan's portrayal as Bhalla a.k.a. Shut up, Robert! was so hilarious. Whenever he got hit during a fight scene, you could hear him squeal. Viju Khote is the dumbfounded Robert a.k.a. Rabbit. I love that Shakti Kapoor a.k.a. Crime Master Gogo. Paresh Rawal's double role is so awesomely hilarious for his portrayal as Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are out of this world. My brother does a really good mimicry of Bhalla saying. Relax. PLEASE relax. I love the scene in which Aamir Khan puts a laxative in Salman Muscles Khan's food which caused the irregular bowel movements forcing him to use the toilet umpteen number of times. 
Best movie Over	India	Funniest Hindi movie ever seen. Actor Salman khan and Amir khan Rocked it.Ive been watching this movie since i was a kid, i grew up watching this movie , I have seen this movie n no. of time, Its still so refreshing even if i watch it again.Crime Master GoGo, Aaakho ki goti bana ke khelunga, Hailah, Oooimaa these are signature dialogs.Excellent Punch lines, each and every character have been chosen so carefullyLove this movie. This is best movie Indian cinema has got. 
Career best from Santoshi	Shanghai	If anyone says this movie is funny, that would be an understatement for sure. This one is Hilarious, a laughter riot!! It has potential to bring your mood from sad to stomach aching funny...I saw this movie in every mood and end result was same, was fresh and happy by the time I completed the movie. And I watched it for more than 50 times. Each and every character in the movie has a cult following in itself... Amar n Prems AAILA UIMA.. crime master Gogo.. Ram Gopal Babaj n Shyam Gopal Bajaj (aka Teja)s double role... super-smart Bhalla n Robert... half-brain blonds Ravina n Karishma... just to name a few.. Not only characters, movie has unforgettable dialogs and scenes... one of the intelligent joke.. remember the coin flipping sequence... Anand Akela asks tum logo ne sholay dekhi hai?? Prem replies haan haan, dus baar.. Amar snaps Iske baap ne likhi hai.. as Sholay was written by Salim Khan (Salmans father in real life) and Javed Akhtar... quite intelligent.. from 1994 (release date) to 2010, Im yet to meet a person who didnt like this movie, but alas this movie was not even a hit during that time.. There were many movies came before and after AAA, but none come even close to it in craziness factor... hats off AAA 
Best Movie Ever	Canada	It is the best movie released in Bollywood upto date. The best comedy, the best acting and the best direction till now! Rajkumar Santoshis writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was absolutely amazing, Salman Khan looked good the way he acted. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep over acted as usual! This comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi hasnt been able to make this cult classic again! This movie was a flop when it released but it has been a cult classic since it released and loved by all kinds of people.STAR.ACTING 10/10.DIALOGUES 10/10.SCREENPLAY 10/10.DIRECTION 10/10.MUSIC 9/10.LYRICS 9/10.Overall, This movie is strongly recommended. If you didnt watch it till now, you missed something big! It is a laugh riot and the best comedy i have seen till date! Classic Films like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even half as funny as this.GREAT MOVIE, HATS OFF!!!! 
if u havent seen it u have missed something awesome!!!!!!	India	very rarely it happens that i sit down to write a comment for a movie....but this movie!!!!!!oh my holy god!!!!!!!!never ever was there a Hindi movie better than this......and never ever there came a movie better than this......its the king of all comedies.....aamir khan is arguably the best COMIC actor in Indian film industry...though its funny to say that because he is a class act,not a comedian...but what he has done in this film is perhaps the most hilarious performance by any Indian actor in an out and out comedy...salman khan has never been a good actor in my eyes....but this movie got the best out of him....he was innocently comic...if ever there was a term like it....just what the doctor ordered as far as his role in the movie was concerned...rajkumar santoshi i dont know why, never tried his hand at comedy again....he directed great ventures like The Legend of Bhagat Singh and khakee but could not recreate the magic of andaz apna apna....i dont care why this film bombed at the box office....though i feel sad that a film like hum aapke hain kaun was the reason for its failure...... as of now i hope the rumors become true.....therell be andaz apna apna-2 they say.......we as the audience can only say AMEN!!!!! 
Excellent movie	United States	AAA is my favorite movie... I have seen it a number of times (dont remember the count now) and every time I just love it.... This is the best movie of Raj Kumar Santoshi..The comedy, dialogues, and performance is amazing.. All the actors and actresses have done a superb job... You cannot stop laughing while watching this movie... its just hilarious... Amir khan and Salman Khan have done a great job... and acting by Paresh Rawal was excellent as always..... The music is inspired from the old Hindi movies (60s music) and is good...the entire cast of the movie has done great job... Overall its a great Indian comedy movie to watch... 
The smartest , funniest film ever produced by Indian Cenima......	Pakistan	The first time I watched it was when it came out (1994), and the last time I watched it was just before writing this review.. It still makes me laugh my brains out...after all these years,it dose not disappoint. Truly the smartest Bollywood comedy ever made. This is one Indian movie which deserves its place in the IMDb Top 250. Aamir Khan and Salman Khan in probably one of their best performances in comedic roles. The thing that makes this one a time less classic is its comic timing and wonderful editing...The jokes are refreshing and not cheap.. This is one film truly ahead of its time. If you havent seen it yet GO WATCH IT NOW !!!!!!!!! 
I would call this a perfect Hindi stoned comic	United States	The best part about this movie is that you can watch it over and over again n still not be content of watching it. I have watched this movie least 10 times over the past 12 years and still it makes me laugh as if i was watching it for the first time. I have great liking for good comics like the Orgazmo,Cheech n chong, Monty Python series and many others but this one in Hindi is one of my favorite outstanding movies. Some of them recently in Hindi are Golmaal,Munnabhai series and Herapheri series. SO all i can say is Hind comedy is finally evolving. But Andaaz Apna Apna is pretty different from the movies i have said above. Its what i call the Hindi stoned comedy and very few of the kind found around 1994 in Hindi cinema.Cheers to Rajkumar Santoshi for the brilliant movie. 
Highly under-rated classic	Middle Earth	For some strange reason the decade of 1990s was completely void of comedy genre in Bollywood. All that existed in the name of comedy was appalling David Dhawan and Govinda combo (sic!). Andaz Apna Apna is a cult-classic which in todays times can be compared to a Hera Pheri. Sadly when released in 1994 it was written off as a flop. Even the casting coup Aamir vs. Salman and Raveena vs. Karishma combo did not stir the cash register. Rajkumar Santoshi proved he is a maverick by steering away from his forte action genre and trying his hand in an un-ventured territory. Aamir Khan clearly ruled the roost. He was at ease in the character of super-confident conman. Comedy timing perfected to the T.Salman Khan had lots of potential in the character. Sadly he clearly faltered. Probably he did not develop the sense of comic-timing then. Nonetheless Salman is compensated with the actual booty in the movie. Raveena and Karishma were passable. Paresh Rawal showed his promise in the comedy genre. Sadly year later it took Hera Pheri for the people to take notice. Other star-cast namely Shakti Kapoor, Mehmood, Jagdeep, Deven Varma, Shehzaad Khan, Harish Patel  Tiku were spot on. Each character leaves an lasting impression. Its a character-based storyline. Songs deserve a special mention as they carry the tinge of the 1960 (ode to O P Nayyar, Naushad, Shankar-Jaikishen etc). At the risk of being repetitive, Andaz Apna Apna is an under-rated classic. Every scene/ every line is nothing short of gem. A definite miss-me-not movie. 
Ahead of its times	India	When Andaz Apna Apna released in 1994,it didnt find many takers, Reason being people didnt know about its release, improper promotion, The film was in making for 3 years and hence it bombed. But slowly the film got cult status and till today its known as one of the funniest comedies. The film is really hilarious, at times too slapstick but yet it works out well, Though its plot is outlandish Director Rajkumar Santoshi after serious films like Ghayal,Damini showed his versatility,though this was started in between of Ghayal and Damini. The film is memorable due to its chemistry between actors,its comedy scenes and also its tributes like Crime Master Gogo being called Mogambo Ka Bhatija.etc and also has digs of Sholay The film at times doesnt make sense too and at times things look too far fetched but then it suits its genreMusic is good, some songs are made to look straight out of a 50s or 60s film to pay tribute, Illu Illu, Yeh Raat and all songs are goodThe actors have inconsistent looks due to its delay but it doesnt suffer on performance level. Aamir Khan is superb as Amar, he is simply too good and makes you laugh throughout Salman Khan though does lag behind and tries a bit too hard yet does make you laugh at times, but their chemistry is topnotch Karisma irritates,Raveena is decent Amongst rest Paresh Rawal is hilarious in both roles, Shehzad Khan imitates his father Ajit in a funny way, Viju Khote are too good, Shakti Kapoor gives one of his memorable performances as Crime Master Gogo,Deven Verma has a brief role and is superb, Mehmood has one scene as a fraud director of Wah Wah Productions(Tribute to Pyaar Kiye Jaa).Jagdeep is as usual in a small role, 
Surely among top 10 movies you should watch before you die.	India	I have seen lots of movies from all around the world. I have watched lots of western comedies , from china , from japan, Korea, from India too. But Andaz Apna Apna is a class apart. Comedy in this movie is not cheap, it does not involve any cheap adult dialogue or comments like western comedies. It has very simple dialogues and body gestures which makes you laugh, which gives the sense that the writer and director has really worked hard on the movie so that every section of the society can enjoy it. You got to understand Indian humor in order to enjoy this movie. I feel sorry for western or other countries audience they will miss this super comedy. I have watched it like 10000 times and I still watch it and will do so till I live. Thank you Raj Kumar santoshi for making this movie. 
A must watch for any Indian film buff	None	Before Aamir had his 3 Idiots, Salman had Dabbang, before Paresh Rawal became the King of Bollywood comedies ala Heri Pheri, before Karishma dropped the h (and the Hindi film industry dropped her) to become Karisma and Raveena was the Mast Mast girl, there was Andaz Apna Apna. This is one of the best movies to have come out of the Indian film industry post the new age cinema wave of the 70s. After the dime-a-dozen masala potboilers of the 80s (not to take away anything from the films of that decade: different times, different sensibilities) Andaz Apna Apna was like a breath of fresh air. The antics of the entire cast leaves the viewers in splits. The comedy might be a bit slapstick and the editing a bit shoddy, but the performances seem at ease. I remember watching this movie in the theater: the laughter never died: it was one gag after the other.Even after all these years, I remember all the dialogues in the movie. And like another all time great Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron, this movie does come up for discussion each time my friends and I watch any new comedy to come out of the Hindi film industry, serving as a benchmark.P.S. I have watched the movie at least 15 times :) 
Movie like this is made once in a lifetime!!!	India	I havent reviewed any movie on IMDb, this is my first time, just that i couldnt hide my joy watching this movie. I have watched this movie many times and it will be never deleted from my computer, i wanna watch it always, its so good. Its just too good. The characters chosen for every role is just too perfect. The best movie by both the khans of bollywood. Amirs acting is just awesome. Salman is also just too good. I just love the performance of Paresh Rawal, one of the best actors in Indian Cinema of modern era. Shakti Kapoor is superb, and also the two sidekicks of Teja, Bhalla and Robert. I dont think any movie in Hollywood or bollywood can beat this type of comedy movie ever. The most important thing is that there is no vulgarity in this movie, as you can see in the new era comedy movies. This movie can be watched by your whole family, any age people will love this movie, from a small kid to elderly people. So just go and enjoy this movie if you havent watched it yet, you will love it!!! 
my favourite comedy movie of all time	India	Andaz Apna Apna is my favorite comedy movie of all time.Both Aamir and Salman khan have acted brilliantly while Aamirs acting was far better than salman.Aamir Khan is known as MR. PERFECTIONIST in Bollywood and he proves it in every of his film.The story moves around two young guys Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan) both are from poor families and are a big dreamer.They want to become rich without bearing any pain.so when they hear about Raveena Bajaj (Raveena Tandon) daughter of Mr.Bajaj(Paresh Rawal) who comes to India to find his bridegroom , they both fool their fathers to marry Raveena Bajaj and the journey begins.There is also a twist in the movie that makes movie even more funny.Paresh Rawal is in double role (Teja and Mr. Bajaj) and has acted brilliantly as he always does.Shakti kapoor (crime master Gogo) also adds a great comedy.This movie is a rib tickling comedy from first minute till last and it is one of classic comedy movies of Bollywood. 
The film works and how!	India	According to me, a movie can be best rated by the number of best scenes there are. There are probably at least 80-90 scenes in the whole movie that is probably rated as best by somebody or the other.This movie is a masterpiece. Period. I know many who have called it ahead of its time, probably because it bombed at box-office. However, I think any generation can relate to this movie and have a good laugh through out.I am personally glad that Mahmood is part of the movie too. His role isnt that meaty, however its good to see that he is a part of the cast in the funniest Hindi movie ever. 
The Best Comedy Movie Ever seen !	Norway	Well this is the best comedy movie i have ever seen... My both Favorite actors did good job. Salman khan and Aamir khan rocked. Hope to see Andaz Apna Apna part 2 soon as i heard they will come back with part 2 as well. i have request to those who havent watched it yet. please buy DVD and watch it u wont feel bored. i am watching this movie 1 times a week. All other was also good in this movie. Paresh Rawal, Shakti and others The music is also good it have also nice songs. there are some sense which will kill u from laughing Salman khan did very nice role and also Aamir.so must watch movie excellent job by actors and director.. 
Overlong but generally very funny comedy	India	Andaz Apna Apna is a Hindi film comedy thats worth seeing despite being overlong. It is packed with funny situations and silly dialog. Both Salman Khan and Aamir Khan are in top form as competing buffoons. Aamir though is slightly better and seems completely at ease in an all out comic role. Karishma and Raveena provide the love interest. There are some catchy musical numbers, a couple of which are surprisingly old-fashioned. The climax is a bit of a letdown with Shakti Kapoor overacting as Crime Master Gogo! Although very long, this film is certainly enjoyable.Overall 7/10 
Main To Kehta Hu Ki Aap Purush hi nahi hai.................	Mumbai, India	The summary is only for those who hate this movie, as finding the movie OK or average is acceptable. Visiting this movie on IMDb has made me nostalgic as I cant help myself going back in the year 1994. I was one of the few lucky ones who saw this movie in theaters. It instantly became one of my favourite comedies and took some years to make it my favourite. How can I say what made this movie my favourite? Was it the excellent writing ( story was OK but screenplay and dialogues were fabulous) Was it the superlative performances? Was it the mood of the film?After thinking about it for so many years I say it has to be a mixture. It is one of those movies which didnt have any flaws not even its music.(the other movie coming up in my mind right now is Sholay)PS: Rajkumar Santoshi please keep a balance between your drama and comedy movies. Only 1 comedy is not enough. I want moreeeeeeee.......... 
just sit and enjoy the ride.....	None	 andaz apna apna will b the movies which will sure b in the list of evergreen movies. its nothing but the masterpiece. ammir and salman r the real stars once again. the film is out and out comedy and if want to enjoy the weekend with family u should watch this classic. the songs r not 2 good,, but u didnt even think if the songs when salman, aamir, paraish,shakte, will make u laugh through  out this movie. the direction is excellent.the comedy is neat and clean.is i were to give marks,, i must have given  5 out of 5. 
Apna?? Apna??	Mumbai	This is definitely the most discussed Indian film. I have discussed dialogs of this film with people in trains and buses. Its not very surprising that most Indian film buffs know this film by heart. Its a genius work and there is no doubt about it. Never a day goes by when I dont cite some dialog or situation from this film like Gurujee Main Star To Ban Jaoonga Na?, Mujhe Dekh Ke Ise Bhee Josh A Gaya,Unhe Bhee Laga Ladke Kee Baat Main Dum hai. Acting is brilliant but its the dialogs and situations that makes this film. Surely anybody can act with such a brilliant script. Music of the film is very bad and there is a lot of it too. The only bad actor in this film is Karishma Kapoor. Bhalla walks away with the glory inspite of such big cast. Its a gem of a film. One my most favorite dialog from this film is Ek Ek Sawal Do Do Jawab. Ek Ek Sawal Do Do Jawab. Sawal Ek Jawab Do.9/10. 
Great!!	United Kingdom	This film I don't know why people say that it was a flop, Because it simply wasn't. What has happened is that someone said that this film was a flop and did not succeed and everyone has believed it. Frankly it was not I remember this film having a bumper opening at the box office and being a HIT. I am part of the Bollywood circuit I'm Bombay and I do no certain Trade Analysts and Critics one of them being Komal Nahta who you may have seen on Television. Ask him he knows that this film was definitely not a flop. I don't know where this misconception has come from as it not true thats for sure. Its simply not true! ASK ANYONE WHO KNOWS ABOUT FILMS 
I make marbles out of your eyeballs.	kent, uk	 Allthough often it has a tendency to veer towards the farcicle, occasionally this film has some genuinely very funny moments.  The character Crime Master Gogo steals all of the scenes in which he is in, as a sort of inneffectual zorro inspired bandit, with the catchphrase threat of I make marbles out of your eyeballs.  I would love to know if this catchphrase has the same meaning in the original language.The rivalry/friendship between the 2 lead roles is entertaining, and the tricky schemes that they come up with to get the girl provide a lot of the comedy.The only real criticism I have for the film, is that sometimes it became too farcicle (uncles and evil twins being mistaken for each other, and being bonked on the head), and I think a couple more songs wouldnt have gone amiss. 
Funniest Bollywood Film of all time	London	Andaz apna apna is one of the funniest films of all time. Very underrated, which i cant understand. Andaz Apna Apna is a intelligent Comedy which we dont get much of in Bollywood. It has its own style and for a change it is not a copy of any Hollywood or previous Bollywood Film. The Director Raj Kumar Santoshi has given us Many Hits like Ghayal and Khakee. He goes one big step ahead with this movie. Aamir Khan is superb in the most funniest role he has given us. Salman Khan is Very amusing in one of his Best Comedies ever. The actresses are not too bad, Raveena and Karishma. The supporting cast are very good. Paresh Rawail is terrific as usual in a double role. Shakti Kapoor is amazingly funny as the cartoonic Bollywood freaky villain named Crime master Gogo. This is a non stop 2 in a half hours entertainment. This is definitely worth the price, A Must See. 
The best Indian comedy film ever!	United States	Two of Bollywoods biggest stars, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan, unite in this hilarious joyride! This film is the best Bollywood comedy film ever, period. Only Hera Pheri is at its level. The jokes are hilarious, the references are great, Aamir and Salman, along with Paresh Rawal, and the duo of Bhalla and Robert, and Shakti Kapoor as Crime master Gogo really entertain! The movie has really great comedy and a great script and great direction, with catchy music as well. Im really surprised at how the heck this wasnt a hit at the box office, because this film really deserved it! Also, it had good direction. The story was common, but the story was played out really well. Everyone should watch this film, I guarantee you will be laughing! 
What a movie.. True example of a sleeper hit....	India	Andaz Apna Apna is the perfect example of a movie gone completely wrong commercially, but emerging a true cult success over the years. This movie released in the cinemas during the peak examination season for school and university students in India (considered a very wrong period to release an Indian movie), and even the music was hardly popular. The result was obvious; the movie didnt last even one full week at some cinemas. But over the years, since the advent of the TV movies and the CD (Compact Disc) revolution in late 90s, this movie became an absolute sleeper hit. There were so many re-runs on TV for this movie, that viewers just stopped by to catch a comic scene. The dialogues of this movie became common punchlines and jokes for everyone. The villains (Shakti Kapoor and Paresh Rawal) are idolized till date, for this memorable role of theirs.Today it is 20 years since the release of this movie, and even till date, Andaz Apna Apna ranks as one of the best comedy movies of Indian cinema. Everything about this movie is magic. The script, the chemistry between the leads (Aamir  Salman), the villains, the side-kicks (Viju Khote and Shehzad khan), the dialogues (extremely witty and timed perfectly) and everything else.This movie is a great watch / re-run with friends, and excellent way to reminisce old times. It is said that the producers were trying to remake this movie, but they never were able to pull it together. As they say, some excellent partnerships can never be remade. 
An All Time Classic	Bangalore, India	How does one describe the movie Andaz Apna Apna or AAA ??Frankly, there is no story. Its a wafer thin plot of two wastrels trying to out smart each other in order to marry a rich girl. But the characters starting from the lead pair of Amar Prem to the villain Teja to the side characters like Crime Master Gogo and Bhalla  Robert to the dialogues to the scenes and screenplay are all (in words of Barney Stinson)....wait for it....Dary...Legendary !!Its a slapstick comedy which makes me feel happy and nice whenever I watch it again and again.Its a pity that Santoshi couldnt make another film like this...I call it a master piece and believe it or not, the movie flopped when released only to become a cult hit decades later.Its also ironic that we call AAA as one of the best Hindi comedy films ever made which was very clean - no gay  double meaning jokes, no foul language and no toilet humor when todays comedy films are full of nonsense stuff I wrote in the above lines. Pity todays film makers praise AAA but fail to learn anything from it. 
Watch it only for the performances and comedy but dont expect logic	United States	Andaz Apna Apna is one of those laugh hard, brainless romantic comedy films where you have to leave your brains behind the door to be able to thoroughly enjoy the movie. The only laurels of AAA are its two brilliant performers Aamir Khan and Salman Khan. The movie was released at a time when both the Khans were considered strong rivals and their careers were at the peak in Bollywood.Their chemistry was crackling in AAA and their comic timings were brilliant. The girls Raveena and Karisma were good in their respective roles but this is a movie where they had nothing to do. Of course, the plot is filled with lot of absurdities and is full of loopholes. But thats something you have to expect in a crazy laugh riot like this. Salmans changing hairstyles, the swapping of names between Raveena and Karisma stick out like a sore thumb. The movie took 3 years to be completed and the gap of 3 years was certainly noticeable in the film. Anyways, AAA is a perfect comical masala film which can surely be enjoyed with family. Go watch it for a good laugh and the excellent performances of the Khans. 
best cult comedy	India	Although it took four years to complete the project and opened as a box office failure ,how strange that people rejected such a timing comic movie,I remember there were only 20-30 people in the movie theater during its opening week.this movie had an original script,i dont think that the scenes were lifted from any other movie.The timing and coordination of all the actors was great although behind the scenes amir,salman,raveena and karishma were not in talking terms during its making.The dialogues were so well written that every scene can make you laugh. must watch 9/10 for good ride of comedy. Watch out if u havent seen yet. 
Hilarious, but a little too silly at times.	Aurora, IL	AAA is definitely among Bollywood's funniest movies of the last 15 years. Thanks to Aamir and Salman's comedic talent, the movie starts off well and is downright hilarious during 70% of its length, but sadly begins to lose pace during the final 30 mins. or so. I don't mind cheesy slapstick humor, but what I do mind is cheesy humor targeted at 6-10 year olds. Some of Salman and the 'Goondas' antics during the 2nd half are downright stupid, and NOT funny. Stuff like 'crime master gogo' may appeal to people who laugh too easily....but it ain't my cup of tea. Nonetheless, barring the final 35 mins. or so and the occasional silly humor, AAA is a laugh-riot not to be missed led by Aamir and Salman's great performances. The chemistry shared between these two is something we probably haven't seen shared between any two actors since. Karishma and Raveena have also lend in fine support. Paresh Rawal's double role is a standout among everybody else. Overall, AAA is a hilarious flick with good repeat value.
