The Godfather is pretty much flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made	United Kingdom	Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.	10
Magnificent portrait of organized crime	EU	This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a must see masterpiece.	10
Another kind of family movie	nowhere	The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for gangster movies, but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every organized crime film nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply influential is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as a movie about gangsters. The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his innocence and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an expos&eacute; of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.	10
perfect	Winnipeg	This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.	10
The Greatest Movie Ever Made	Yorktown	The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy.	9
Initially, I wasnt a fan... but then I realised	Australia	This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didnt like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brandos ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Dons children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation theyre put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the characters character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isnt to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isnt mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.	10
The Pinnacle Of Flawless Films!	Worcester, England	The Godfather is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed The Godfather I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So lets start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, I believe in America, its crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the films threshold. This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970s film industry (including a certain horses head), The Godfather epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleones are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywoods greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.	10
A Masterpiece	Casa Nostra	This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one mans reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!	10
This Movie Has Haunted My Life...	United States	I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him.	10
The world inside the underworld!	United States	The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, Oh that was 10 out of 10. If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy	10
For me it isn't the greatest ever, but it's still great	New York City	Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving business guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again? The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to 11 doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of oscillating dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) zoom out from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the greatest film of all time hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a historical family saga as a crime or gangster film.	10
The Godfather	Marietta, OH	Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money.	10
An exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances...	Mexico	The Godfather is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal families, and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times... With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by liquor, gambling, and even women... He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the sovereignty. In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment Never to take sides against the Family. The opening shot of The Godfather sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie big shot named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact...	10
An Epic, Masterful Look into the Underground World	United States	The Godfather simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best Ive ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie Ive ever seen or will ever see. Its also one of the most precise and intricate films Ive ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching The Godfather, is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppolas direction is what brings this film, thats so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. Hes the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonnys (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, Thats my family, Kay. Thats not me. We get the feeling that Michaels nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. Hes the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the familys actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. Hes treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leaders confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he cant refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino shinning moment in the film. Theres no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) gets upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredos height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, Fredo, dont ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.Thats some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michaels change believable. Hes not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as hes capable of turning on anyone and using the line, Its strictly business when it comes to family issues. Michaels sister, Connie, calls him a cold hearted bastard at the end of the film. Its hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino performance is that he doesnt sugarcoat it. He doesnt try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. Thats the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and lets us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like The Godfather, that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.	10
A film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema	Tunbridge Wells, England	Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10	8
An Iconic Film	Queens, New York	Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you cant. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a clich&eacute;. His performance though was not a clich&eacute;. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horses head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, Ill give him an offer he cant refuse and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I dont know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.	10
One Can See Why Its So Highly-Rated	United States	Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldnt quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because its understandable. It also has a memorable score.One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because its so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didnt rate it as high as others was I didnt like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la Bonnie & Clyde, that was fine with me!There isnt as much violence as people might think, if theyve never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. Thats part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its business.Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.I am also fortunate to own The Godfather Epic on tape, which must be some sort of collectors item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. Its well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I dont see it listed on IMDb.	9
Great look at a family based around crime	United Kingdom	Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.  Now that's respect.	8
A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: A cinematic magnum opus	India	The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesnt depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it wont be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/	10
Count Me In The Minority	Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada	First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought The Godfather was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's business never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family business to the eventual Don.It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10	6
Slightly overrated	Twin Cities	One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred Goodfellas. The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10	8
The Greatest Film of All Time !  Period.	United States	This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems too old or young for the part. Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem out of place or unconvincing. The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times youve seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS The Godfather Saga (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.	10
Make More Something Like this...	Latvia	The Godfather is as good as everyone says it is. It a near flawless film that achieves so much with so little. What it has is a fantastic script, amazing cast and a director with a vision. No fancy tricks, gimmicks, 3D or any other crap. The Godfather is template on which films should be made but ,sadly, they dont do it. Just like Jackie Brown, Infernal Affairs, Il Mare, Daisy, Heat, Network, Glory, Dog Day Afternoon, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Manhunter, My Sassy Girl and so on, The Godfather takes its time to develop its characters, allows you to enjoy the performances with slow and steady direction and makes a great use of atmosphere. I love films that allow us to sit down and enjoy a story with very strong characters. Ill take The Godfather over Avengers, Dark Knights, Pulp Fictions any day.Its nearly impossible to name all the great things that are in Godfather. The cast is terrific with some our greatest actors of all time: Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, John Cazale, James Caan, Sterling Hayden, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall and so on. The direction by Francis Ford Coppola s fantastic and his co-written script with Mario Puzo is flawless. And I can keep naming positives all day...There really isnt much to be said about The Godfather, but Im very sad that there isnt a lot of films that are like it, especially in Hollywood. I dont mean gangster films but films that are slow moving, with strong characters, engaging story and beautiful visuals. South Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong and Europe are the only places to look for those nowadays... The Godfather is a film for an adult. Its made for people that can appreciate a great storytelling and all the craftsmanship put into it. I dont see it as a gangster movie but as a complex family drama. Godfather should be seen by anyone who considers himself a fan of film and film making.	10
Best movie ever	Romania	I love this movie. Its the greatest movie I ever seen in my life. Every time I watch it I see something new. It has drama, action and even comedy. The story is great. It centers around the most powerful New York mafia run by The Godfather. It teaches you about family and betrayal, about life in general. All that Michael does is for his family. He even sacrifices his relationship with his girlfriend to protect his family. The movie is amazingly shot, giving it amazing light. The characters are bigger than life and played by some of the greatest actors to ever live. The soundtrack is very good. All in all is must see.	10
Timeless classic...!!!!!

The Pioneer of All Filmmaking	Leesburg, Florida	The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing. The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. Hes my role model. The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast! The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. Thats why hes my role model. The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. Its awesome.	10
mafia	Turkey	God Father came to the best mafia movie history owes the beauty of the depth of the event although not touching the films screenwriter. Generally greater than all of the family prominent in Mafia movies keep the subject here treated as.  But if the head is feeling lonely (in every sense) family and professional life is no longer the way it was put right.  God Father 1 and 2 family integrity while maintaining almost 3 arises where I also ended up in the film.  There is also something that should not be forgotten alone; When thick to go through every stage of life between the stay should be limits to what the best deals are to be considered.	10
The Finest American Cinema Has To Offer	Kentucky, United States	It has been said so many times that it seems clich, but I wil continue to say it. The Godfather is one of he greatest movies ever made. Words cannot express how well the film combines all the elements a film needs, to be good. The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is great, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this movie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this movie, and is expertly brought to life.The beginning of the film starts out at the wedding of Don Vito Corleones daughter, Connie. At the wedding reception we are introduced to the many of the members of the Corleone crime family, however not all of them are part of the family business. At the wedding, Vitos youngest son, Michael, tells his then girlfriend, Kay, that he was not like his family. Throughout the rest of the film, we see Michael Corleone transform into the very thing he claims he hates. Its an excellent example of how character growth should be done.From the intriguing beginning where we find Vito Corleone being asked for favors, to the climatic ending where Michael finishes his transformation, The Godfather is a landmark film in American cinema.	10
Great movies are not born great, they are made great.	Kolkata, India	I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, Is it The Godfather level good or not ?.This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldnt find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfathers mansion. All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of Bravo!. This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.	10
A elegiac and well organize American Crime drama, that hits home with what it means to die for your family.	United States	Its a bit difficult to find a part, a moment, within the film that doesnt showcase great acting, story-telling, and a heart to what it means to have honor and pride. A well deserved film. Brandos brilliance is showcased within The Godfather. Al Pacino is a the seed that is placed within the story, who continually grows throughout by the light of his father. Although, some seeds are worth pulling. The undertone of the story is the concept of corruption and the fall of an empire, and a start to a new one. Fracis Ford Coppolas masterpiece, an everlasting mark on American Cinema. Definitely a piece of history, and youre along for the ride, and experiencing the visceral feeling of that era.	10
Review	None	The few perfect films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppolas revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern cinema, Coppolas The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rotas breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppolas very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather.	10
Masterpiece	Spain	Its hard to find a moment in the film that isnt great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. The Godfather is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.You cant miss this movie.	10
Im going to make him an offer he cant refuse.	United States	One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vitos only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vitos bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleones lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and its easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because thats what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it.	10
The Best Movie of all time	Iran	The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all gangster movies have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfathers success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vitos youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their adopted brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the dons right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vitos refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (its therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from innocent bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Next to Humphrey Bogarts Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brandos Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (A man who doesnt spend time with his family can never be a real man) and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the throne, is one of The Godfathers most revealing moments (about both father and son).The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, its surprising that Duvall wasnt passed over. His presence in The Godfather isnt flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caans Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality cant be overlooked.Family responsibility. A fathers legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppolas cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New Yorks Italian crime families. The word Mafia conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.	10
Perhaps the Greatest of All Time?	None	I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i havent thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and thats when i decided to take a chance with Godfather. I wasnt a fan of gangster flicks so its fair to say i never thought id sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDbs 250)I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.Im not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up! In my opinion The Greatest Gangster Film ever. And Arguably the greatest movie of all time. 10 out of 10.	6
Mario Puzo's soapy Mafia saga	United Kingdom	Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s.	8
This Consummate, Quintessential World-Class Masterwork Is Head Over Heels Better Than The Dark Knight By a Long Shot, and You All Know It.	Cincinnati, OH, United States	The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or dont, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleones family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rotas immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michaels ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his fathers standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfathers function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, theres a look about him as if hes just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brandos performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isnt time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Williss reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vitos wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonnys wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vitos life alters Michaels attitude, and he comes back to help defend his familys wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michaels bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the films most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.	10
Sets the standard for the gangster art film.	Massachusetts	The Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film auteur. Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubricks philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfathers brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleones daughter, not only establishes the Dons character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Dons world and legitimate society. For instance, the films opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding favor, whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, I believe in America. America has made my fortune, and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and theyre the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we dont get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now. Its not personal, Sonny. Its strictly business. And most famously of all: Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse. The films title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brandos performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Dons subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the films plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brandos by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michaels centrality is signaled by the Dons frantic call, Wheres Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael! A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leaders head, he relates, and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. Thats my family Kay. Its not me. Michaels initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as Senator Corleone or Governor Corleone not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michaels coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten-year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the films art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the films mise en scene. Moreover, the films lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (prince of darkness) Willis, contributes greatly to both the films realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes  especially in the Dons home office  with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the films last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michaels participation in the baptism of sister Connies child. Likewise, The Godfathers soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas) and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that crime did not pay. Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generations-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos.	10
gangster	United States	opularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a godfather or don, the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family business. A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug-trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisors Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible.	10
A must watch especially with directors commentary	United States	Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world youve entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you dont find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know youre dealing with greatness.From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies Im sure youll experience the same.	10
Mind blowing drama, a must see	wow	Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzos The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). Its the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesnt (or, at least, shouldnt) pay.It still doesnt, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family arent limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzos point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narratives point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacksthey are animals anyway.This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. Its not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of lifemarriages, baptisms, family feastsbecome an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. Its nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.	10
A true masterpiece	United States	What can i say about The Godfather that hasnt already been said, this film is a masterpiece it is a cinematic landmark, it is in my opinion, better than Goodfellas, Goodfellas is great but this is such a more dramatic film. I love the beginning of this film when the undertaker is asking Vito Corleone for justice, it was such a beautifully shot scene i loved how Marlon Brando portrayed Vito it is one of if not his best performance (Apocalypse Now is his second) of his career. Te Godfather is in my top 10 films of all time and it will always will be no other film can change that. The Godfather will always be remembered as the greatest film of all time and will never be forgotten, i just love this film so much it actually was one of the inspirations that made me want to become a film director and Im only 14, it made me actually made me appreciate film and i am glad i watched this even its sequel was amazing and is in my top 20 favorite films of all time but 3 was terrible it should have never had ever been made and i will stick by that as long as i live but i love Francis Ford Coppolas direction of the film it will never be forgotten.	10
A masterpiece	Kragujevac	Francis Ford Coppola has outdone himself with The Godfather, probably the greatest movie in cinema history. Marlon Brando shows us his magnificent skills and his way of dominating the scene. The Dons relationship with his family is unique and incredibly well depicted. Looking at Brandos career, which is frighteningly impressive, to say the least, the role of Don Vito Corleone is without a doubt his best one. To say that Al Pacino was incredible in this movie and the rest of the trilogy would be an understatement. James Caan, in the role of Sonny, comes right after Brando and Pacinos stunning performances. Truly a masterpiece, The first part of this epic trilogy will forever be at the very top of my list.	10
This Movie is an Offer you Cant Refuse	None	Incredible!! With the epic soundtrack, characters, plot, casting, and directing this movie has to be considered THE best of all time. Although it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this movie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from the inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and care about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDbs 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable. Nobody couldve known that Marlon Brando, with two cotton balls, would create the most famous voice in cinematic history.	10
A tour de force of cinema	Malaysia	Since I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the time, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that is, until watched it two years ago.How to tell if a movie is good? If you cant stop thinking about it, if you keep replaying the characters lines in your sleep, then the movie isnt just good, its great. The Godfathers impact on the movie industry is incalculable, in almost ever modern gangster movie there is at least one reference to it.I can find no flaw in this movie. If there were anything such as a perfect movie, this is it. Coppola provides excellent direction such that though the movie stretches to almost three hours, you wont be bored for one minute. The highlight of this film is an innovation. The gangsters here are not portrayed as mindless monsters but as men with families. We see Vito and Michael Corleone as protagonists rather than antagonists. Credit for this goes to Mario Puzos original source material but let us not forget the actors.Marlon Brando gives the greatest performance of not only his career but of any other actor as the family patriarch. Hes so Don-like that you just wished you could go to him with all your problems too. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone. But he doesnt give a single performance, he gives two. At the beginning, he plays a war hero who doesnt want anything to do with the family business. Pacino skillfully shows us Michaels transition from this to a cold blooded Don at the end. The other actors play their parts well too. In fact, there has never been any other better cast than the cast of The Godfather.A cinematic masterpiece, this is one for the ages.	10
in short awesome.....	None	Instead of focusing on everything that is extraordinary about The Adoptive parent, a much simpler path for me to judge its quality is on what is awful about it. Each film has something that I dont care for about it, however I can genuinely say that I wouldnt change anything about The Back up parent. There is nothing powerless about it and nothing that emerges as terrible. That is the reason it gets ten out of ten. This is one of those movies that made me ask why I hadnt seen it prior. The acting from everybody included is extraordinary, Marlon Brando runs over superbly as the leader of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are astounding as his children. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is additionally extremely essential, bringing back memories of the film each time I hear it. The plot must be fabulous for it to get ten out of ten, and it will be, its a long way from unsurprising and the film is the meaning of an awesome epic. The film is really stunning in the way every demise happens momentarily, and as it compasses ten years such a variety of distinctive things happen and each moment of it is extraordinary stimulation. Its a well- made and enthralling film that is just the first piece of a set of three, yet it remains all alone as a superb film in its own particular right. On the off chance that you havent seen it, what are you holding up for? This was one acclaimed film that didnt baffle.	8
Watch it twice!	California, United States	I wasnt too impressed by this film the first time I saw it. However, it got better the more I saw it. A movie like this would be impossible to make today. Francis Ford Coppola is a marvelous director and loves his characters in order to get authentic performances out of them.The violence is brutal, the script is superb, and the soundtrack is incredible. Everyone involved should be proud at what they accomplished. I never read the book but fans say its a faithful adaptation. Goodfellas is a mobster film I like slightly more but The Godfather is still a cinematic achievement. I know some people are going to get on my case for not calling it the best movie ever made in the history of mankind, but Im not denying that its a good movie.Just watch it more than once to enjoy it for what it is and youll love it like I did!	8
A Must-See For All Generations	Greece	The Godfather has been a title so beloved and entirely embraced as a significant, cultural phenomenon, that in a certain level demands of you to watch it with full recommendations off of it. Especially if youre young, there is absolutely no way that the buzz of the greatest movie in history did not get you. So, even though that buzz doesnt necessarily ruin the viewing for you all-together, I will accept that while I was watching, I was unintentionally trying to like it and feel it.The beginning of the film sets the mood perfectly. There are no attachments to settled humor or dry dialogue. It warns us that this is going to be a serious take, on some pretty serious issues. Don Corleones first lines are self-aware and carefully put. This dominating appearance shows us a man trusted, beloved and respected and at the same time feared, depressed and deserted. And that goes for both his family and outsiders. He is a mafia man, one of the greatest, and his life is surrounded by his business partners, by his associates and comrades in this dark lifestyle. And throughout the entire movie, he is presented to have balanced the time between family and business, yet that seems like one impossible task. Micheal Corleone, son of the Godfather, is introduced like a man with a very different approach and very different opinions on the case of life and choices than the rest of his family and especially his father. That happens for two reasons: early on his life he decided not to be like him (even though he seems to be the one attached by the Godfather as the favorite) and he has chosen a decent life for him and Kay, the love of his life. Then, everything goes down the drain: someone attempts to kill the Godfather. It is at that point when the son Micheal starts his decay... No promises, no commitments, no wrongs... Someone tried to kill his loving father. He stares at every single person in his family just standing by, so in his rage, decides to do the unthinkable. Using his status as the most innocent of the Corleone family, he exacts revenge.When he succeeds, he exiles himself out of the country until things can settle down. He attempts to start a new life away from the madness with Apollonia, a beautiful woman he meets and falls in love with (although never convincing even himself that he has forgotten Kay). He comes to know the hard way that he cant run away from what he has done and what his family stands for. Someone tries to kill him even so far from his home but gets to Apollonia. So upon his return, he accepts the position of the new Godfather and immediately seems to be a changed man.Micheal retrieves Kay, makes unconditional promises and ends up being the very person he was trying to avoid.There are several things in this film that make it astounding. Relationships within the family are displayed in such a truthful way. Francis Ford Coppola offers us a chance to connect with many different characters and their several views. The main plot is driven excellently, with Don Corleone and Micheal taking the grandeur, but in the meanwhile we get to know the deep motions and powers of every person slightly connected to this world. What we get is a fiery and passionate film exploring deep meanings and strong notions. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for what was an unbelievably great performance. After this film, I totally get his worldwide fame as one of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino shines with charisma (which he perfected on the second part) in the greatest role of his career. And besides these two super-actors, is there anyone from the cast that I can talk badly for? All great.I guess the only issue with this movie is its running-time and most importantly the somewhat complicated way things glue together. I understand that Mario Puzo had a difficult task of bringing the book on- screen, but its the way we are drawn to these characters that makes me confused about who is who. And that is the reason I suggest we stick to the father-son relationship and not worry about certain aspects and scenes we dont understand or just keep asking who is that guy talking?This is the Godfather that everyone is talking about for decades, and if you dont like what you hear in the very first scene in that dark room, I warn you... turn of the picture and dont watch anymore. Come back a few years later when you could probably handle it.On the other hand, you must ask yourself: can you feel the zest for respect and loyalty when Don Corleone whispers his lines? Dont you yearn for the moral and innocent Micheal as the movie goes? Can you sympathize with Kay when the door closes at the end? Then The Godfather got you where it should have.	8
Geeky Randys summary	United States	Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzos best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his fathers footsteps. Pacinos transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that its worth every second of the films epic length, while Brandos iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinemas greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.**** (out of four)	10
The best movie by far.	Sweden	So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleones face when I was a kid... Years later I decided its time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I cant say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you havent watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is its line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.	10
Reaction	United Kingdom	just outstanding the sense or morality even thought what they do is wrong, you get a sense of pride and respect. at the end you do start wanting to create the same level of respect and love with your own family as if it was the same. defiantly deserves the word legendary as it is a timeless classic and should be watched if you havent already.this movie should be watched closely and with patients to get into as i can come across so the viewers that are not use to this type of pace, storyline can get confusing sometimes if your bad with names, other than that there no issues the film is well known for a reason and allows for multiple deductions to made within it as you try to find out who did what.	10
Barzinis a pimp	Texas	..Barzinis a pimp. That is my favorite line in this movie...There are many more lines. Lines that everyone should watch. Because this movie is one of the best movies ever made, and certainly one of the best mob/crime movies. If you like Goodfellas, Casino, or anything else with Joe Pesci. You will like this movie just as much. The cinematic quality is fantastic. The dialogue and acting are very convincing and makes it feel like you are watching history, not just a movie. And speaking of history, talk about Marlon Brando. Good lord. The guy puts his existence on pause to breathe life into Don Vito Corleone as the Godfather. His roll is phenomenal. And thats 10 lines, go watch the movie	10
Hollywoods Finest	United Kingdom	The Godfather is in my opinion the second greatest movie of all time. The pacing is flawless, the acting is absolutely mesmerising and the story is the most simply complicated one ever. Brando and Pacino were a match made in heaven for their characters and no movie will ever reach the pinnacle like The Godfather did. Stunning brilliant.10/10 Acting10/10 Story10/10 Pacing10/10 Adaptation from novel10/10 Overall	10
Good	Baku	I like it. This is good film and 10/10. Thanks all! I watched all series of this film. The Godfather is the finest cinematic achievement ever. It had the first truly ensemble cast, and writing which matched, if not bettered, its masterful source material. It was a truly original mafia film of its time, imitated by a lot more media as time passed. It was the first gangster film to revolve around the families of the gangsters, rather than the action, which just added to the suspense. The Godfathers essential components from its cinematography, editing, score, directing and writing can be praised to the ends of this Earth, but one thing always stands out for me: the acting. Marlon Branos Vito Corleone is rightfully seen as the legends greatest performance; Robert Duvall and James Caan are the two only imaginable actors (who gave instinctive performances) for the roles of Sonny Corleone and Tom Hagen. But Al Pacino, in a brilliantly developed role as Michael Corleone, stands out due to his convincing acting, along with an interesting and cohesive back story. Every other actor is appropriate for their roles, and all are phenomenal in their career best performances. It is by far, the greatest film I have ever seen and my favorite film ever.	10
I remember when I saw this film for the first time...	Sarajevo BH	This was a classic for me when I saw it for the first time, later I made all of my family watch it, we became true la Familia ;) not really a crime syndicate, but rather we loved what we saw in this film. I think this one is the best of the three parts and it is a timeless classic.I think Marlon Brando really deserves the Oscar for his role in this film, just as the film deserves other Oscars that it won.It is hard to add more laudeamus about this film that has already been written, I will let you read other reviews which I read which makes it so interesting to read. I will leave you with a question. How much of this could happen in the real life? I will leave you to wonder.	8
A classic Godfather	United Kingdom	Plot Don Vito Corleone (Brando) is brutally pursued when he refuses to Sully the family business with drugs. His eldest, Sonny (Caan), steps in to take the helm in his fathers illness, but is riddled with bullets. It is up to Michael (Pacino), the war hero and beloved son, to step up redeem the familys honourThe Godfather packs more into one gangster film than some genres output over decades. It is a big film with big themes, has memorable characters and lines. Mario Puzo novel once again proves that hes the master of storytelling  and Francis Ford Coppola of thrillingly violent filmmaking. With its all star cast this should go straight to the head of the list of essential viewing. With a classic sequel also to view. You will rarely get it so good.Makes Bernard Mungeam 5 star films	10
He is a good godson.	United States	This film has spawned so many gangster clichs and parodies that its not even funny. Every time youve heard of people sleeping with da fishies or making an offer you cant refuse, itll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horses head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brandos mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...its all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag Ive felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)	8
John Cena is the Next Star in Hollywood.	None	Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history. The symbolism featured in the scene, such as the shiny body oil and the you cant see me hand gesture, is the best Ive ever seen. By far the best movie I have ever seen. Pretty much the best movie of all time. My favorite scene is the one in which John Cena body-slammed Michael Corleone. This scene is pivotal in movie history.

Over all	Atlanta, GA United States	This film is an example of a great director, quality actors, outstanding script writing/ screen play and an amazing film score. I love it!My favorite scene:Don Corleone: Why did you go to the police? Why didnt you come to me first? Bonasera: What do you want of me? Tell me anything, but do what I beg you to do. Don Corleone: What is that? Bonasera whispers his request in the Dons ear That I cannot do. Bonasera: I will give you anything you ask. Don Corleone: Weve known each other many years, but this is the first time you ever came to me for counsel or for help. I cant remember the last time that you invited me to your house for a cup of coffee, even though my wife is godmother to your only child. But lets be frank here. You never wanted my friendship. And, uh, you were afraid to be in my debt. Bonasera: I didnt want to get into trouble.Don Corleone: I understand. You found paradise in America, you had a good trade, you made a good living. The police protected you and there were courts of law. And you didnt need a friend like me. But, uh, now you come to me, and you say: Don Corleone, give me justice. But you dont ask with respect. You dont offer friendship. You dont even think to call me Godfather. Instead, you come into my house on the day my daughter is to be married, and you ask me to do murder for money.Bonasera: I ask for justice. Don Corleone: That is not justice. Your daughter is still alive. Bonasera: Let them suffer then, as she suffers. How much shall I pay you? Don Corleone: Bonasera, Bonasera. What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If youd come to me in friendship, then this scum that wounded your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if by chance an honest man like yourself should make enemies, then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you. Bonasera: Be my friend  Godfather. Bonasera bows toward the Don and kisses the Dons hand Don Corleone: Good. Someday, and that day may never come, Ill call upon you to do a service for me. But until that day  accept this justice as a gift on my daughters wedding day.Bonasera: Grazie, Godfather. Don Corleone: Prego. Give this to, uh, Clemenza. I want reliable people, people who arent going to be carried away. After all, were not murderers, in spite of what this undertaker thinks. The Godfather	10

Legendary Movie	Dubai	This type of movies which you get to watch over and over again without getting bored of it, they way it has been scripted, acted, produced and directed is really attractive and amazingly catching your breath, it has a lot of life lessons to learn from no matter what do you do in your life, it also shows the importance of family bonding and keeping it all balanced. Im convinced that I will never ever get to watch a similar movie to this one with this brilliance in every aspect, I dont even believe that if there would be anyone on this earth who has never saw the Godfather Trilogy, it is absolutely highly recommended, but of course its not suitable for the little kids, it has lots of violent scenes, hopefully well get to see more and more of these awesome titles.	10
The Best movie ever	portugal	The Godfather is overflowing with life, rich with all the grand emotions and vital juices of existence, up to and including blood. To permit us a glimpse at The Mob, with all of its ethnic insularity, is like giving a chronic gambler a chance to wander above the false mirrors that overlook every casino. A defining film in the history of cinema, The Godfather introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. In its blending of new depth with an old genre, it becomes that rarity, a mass entertainment that is also great movie art. As filmmaking and storytelling, The Godfather remains a bravura piece of work, its set pieces, dialogue and performances entrenched cinematic icons.	10
The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time.	Romania	The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time. It is a flawless movie. Francis Ford Coppolas brilliant directing, This movie is his greatest achievement. Great performances by the actors especially the Oscar winning performance by Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone. Al Pacinos acting was phenomenal. The Godfather is told entirely within a closed world thats why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. Vito Corleone is the moral center of this movie. A movie of its caliber never becomes obsolete. It is a movie with actually no plot holes. It is a complete movie. The Godfather views the Mafia from inside. It is truly a masterpiece and the best movie.	6
Such a freaking classic.	good review	Don Vito Corleone: You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?. The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends dont know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars thats how good to movie is.	10
Look how they massacred my boy	None	The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penns Bonnie  Clyde) to the premiere of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia order.	10
a film depicting the little Italy in NY	China	People always say America is a big melting pot, but actually it is not actually like that. America is separated by different communities,the WASP, the catholics, Jewish people, the Asian, and the black people.Italian immigrants belong to the catholics,but they are looked down upon by some other European immigrants,so they have to ask help from their godfather, the mafia. This film is really impressive.Don Coleone is really a good father, his elder son has a bad temper, his second son is weak, his younger son is intelligent ans unique.This is a big family,this family culture is deeply rooted in their brains.This film is a mirror of Italy society:Power, Women and Money. There is a lot of media reports about Italy PM ex-PM Belusconi, why this corrupt PM not sacked even he faces lots of charges? People always say America dream, but the reality is cruel. If you want to make fortune, you must have support from your relations even the mafia.The wealth is controlled by a few people, they make their money through their relations become richer.This is Capitalism.	6
Great movie but extremely overrated	United States	The Godfather is most peoples favorite movie of all time and thats fine. But for me their are better mob movies that explore the mafia. This movie is an epic such as Saving Private Ryan or Gladiator but it doesnt give you an emotional staying power like these films do. Be that as it may, I really enjoyed The Godfather because it makes the story of these characters believable. The three strong points of this movie are its story, you live this life with these characters and you dont doubt that they had to go through serious heartbreak and triumph throughout their lives. Another strong point is Marlon Brandos performance as Vito Corleone. It is an iconic screen performance and has definitely been copied in later crime movies. Its such an original character. And then the last strong point is the writing, so many memorable quotes are from this film and as they should be. In action movies visual effects and stunt doubles make you feel good. In a great movie like this the action is the dialogue. An overall good movie but extremely slow.	7
The Godfather (1972)	Greece	Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzos The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). Its the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesnt (or, at least, shouldnt) pay.It still doesnt, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family arent limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzos point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narratives point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacksthey are animals anyway.This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. Its not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of lifemarriages, baptisms, family feastsbecome an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. Its nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes.	10
The Greatest Cast For A Movie Ever.	United Kingdom	Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. The Godfather is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughters Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horses head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldnt have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say Falls from grace is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich Sepia toned movie.Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. The Godfather, has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brandos or Pachinos? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the Love theme all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppolas efforts.Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: Probably the finest cast ever assembled. 10/10.	10
The Geatest Movie Ever Made	Canada	You cant really criticize a film like The Godfather, especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has been highly praised by fans universally. Its extremely hard for a person who has never seen The Godfather without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobsters depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughters wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. Its not revenge, as long as your daughters still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a Moustache Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, its just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and its up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzos book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. The Godfather is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacinos Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michaels transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book its handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. Its also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But thats good for the novels sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, The Godfather is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words required viewings.	10
Very Average Film. Very Overrated	United Kingdom	Marlon Brandos acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. Its just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still havent seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it.	7
Filming of Horses Head Scene	United States	I was present when the filming of the Horses head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horses head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Dons relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50 of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a rookie to the making of The Godfather. Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the Gold Coast of Long Island. One was the new version of Sabrina, starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks...	10
Im finding it hard to describe how amazing this movie was	United Kingdom	There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films Ive seen, so much so I couldnt think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didnt see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horses head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacinos casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox	10
For justice, we must go to Don Corleone.	United States	Lately it seems, The Godfather has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I dont see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason Ive never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during its theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. Theres a good reason why. I dont think theres ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the sleeps with the fishes calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasnt Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! Quite simply, The Godfather is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931s Little Caesar and Public Enemy. For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that its impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of its supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.There has been enough written about the film that I dont need to get into the story itself. Ill content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonnys job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michaels restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagens ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devils work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that cant be refused. With The Godfather, it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of its parts. So Ill content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. For cinema fans, The Godfather is all cannoli.	10
A beautiful film	United Kingdom	I have not watched this film since the 70s. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1. The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife Why cant you two just enjoy a film without checking if its good or not on that website you go on? I put off watching it with him for ages because its about 3 hours long and Im prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we wont do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and its just business. The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like Im going to blow you away motherf*cker It just makes you an offer that you cant refuse.	10
Im gonna make him an offer he cant refuse	Germany	Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this line of business to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but The Godfather manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the good boy of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.Francis Ford Coppolas film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and dont lay you to rest.The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes)  thats absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor.	10
not the godfather of all movies	Ringmer (East sussex), England	As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time.	9
A flawless masterpiece	Peru	So, those of you who havent seen it may wonder, Whats so good about the Godfather? Why is it that this, out of every movie ever made, is considered by so many people to be one of the if not the all-time best? Allow me to explain as best I can. Its the kind of movie where everything is perfect. Everything. The acting, the script, the pacing, the cinematography, right down to the soundtrack. All of it.Oh, sure, its a leisurely movie. It clocks in at just under three hours, and the plot takes a while to unfold. But it is NOT slow or boring. While not a suspense film in the traditional sense, the movie is definitely suspenseful, and I have to applaud Coppola for his excellent use of tension building. In other words, he uses the three-hour length of the film perfectly: theres not a wasted minute among these 175, not a single bit Id take out.And besides, the acting is great. Just awesome. Brandos performance is stunning; the guy just oozes cool, as he always does. Hes magnetic as Vito Corleone, arguably his most famous role ever. And, of course, Al Pacinos Michael Corleone deserves nothing but the highest of praise. It was the guys big break, and he does a fantastic job displaying Michaels ruthless, cunning, coldly intelligent rise to power. The two of them pretty much make the movie, but even people playing bit parts give their all, resulting in a movie that makes mobsters seem very human. Special shout-out to Robert Duvall for his excellent turn as Tom Badass Hagen, and Diane Keaton (one of my favorite actresses, Ill add) as Michaels girlfriend and moral compass Kay. Having been mostly familiar with her for her roles in those classic Woody Allen movies, I had no idea she could carry a dramatic role, but she does an excellent job. And the script is just awesome, including a couple classic lines.Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. And, of course, He made him an offer he couldnt refuse. A whole ton of memorable ones. Actually, pretty much every line in this movie is quotable, and given its three-hour length, thats pretty impressive. And that theme song... oh man. One of the best ever written.A note also must be made on the baptism scene. All aspiring filmmakers should watch this movie for a lot of reasons, but for that scene in particular. The building of tension, the symbolism, the sacred-profane juxtaposition, the heart-stopping climax... perfect. The scene encapsulates everything I love about the movie into just a few minutes.And thats the Godfather for you. Its bleak, tender, touching, violent, thoughtful, occasionally horrifying (the famed horse head scene, anyone?), and sometimes even darkly funny. Its a complete masterpiece in every sense of the word. This, and its sequel for that matter, is a movie for the ages. Basically, if its directed by Francis Ford Coppola and its got Robert Duvall in it, youre in for a fantastic movie. Thats a good rule of thumb. And the book its based on is just as good!	10
Good, Maybe Great, Not The Best Movie Ever	None	Like I said: Definitely not the best movie ever. While the movie had its good points, I can't see why it's number 1 on IMDB. I don't even think it was better than Goodfellas, or even better than the other two movies I rented (American History X, Casablanca). Oh well, still good entertainment, looking forward to Godfather Part II.	7
A work of art.	Co Down, Northern Ireland	Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.	8
