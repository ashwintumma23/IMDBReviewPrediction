I want 105 minutes of my life back.	New Zealand	Why would anyone give this film anything higher than 1? All this film had was crappy acting, stupid FX that didn&#x27;t even look real, and a $10,000 budget.The film: Takes 47 minutes before the birdemic actually begins, worst dialog ever, and I think the entire film was shot on a toy camera, because, well... the wind can be heard throughout the entire film.The effects: Makes Sharknado look like Avatar. You know what&#x27;s worse? Almost all of the names listed in the credits are fake.I don&#x27;t even know why I warned people about spoilers, because this film is so bad it doesn&#x27;t need to be seen by anyone. It really is that bad.My reviews are always pretty short, mainly because I suck at writing reviews, so I&#x27;m just going to describe this film in the most simple way: It makes The Room, Troll 2, Battlefield Earth and Jaws 4 look like masterpieces. Save your money for something else.	1
this movie is so bad that is why it is called shock and terror	None	i mean seriously? WTF? XD -the birds look like an 8 year old kids project.-worst sound ever. there are sound cuts.-an orangutan can act better as a human being.- nothing in this movie makes sense.-first 45 minutes is boring as hell.-its &#x22;birdimic&#x22; what do you expect?.-the birds have WW2 sound effects. also they EXPLODE ON IMPACT.-much more like 1/100.this is amazingly bad. makes troll 2 looks like the lord of the rings. it might be entertaining to a degree. watch it at your own risk.	1
By no doubt, the worst movie ever made. But also something everybody should watch!	Sweden	Most people usually say that if you put time and effort into something, the result will always be good. James Nguyen spent a total of four years making Birdemic, and he proved the opposite. This movie, is one of the worst movies ever made, if not the worst. But I think people should watch this. I especially think that this is something that should be shown at different film schools, instead of movies like Citizen Kane. You learn by your mistakes right? Well, then you learn by watching a bad movie and not masterpieces.Birdemic is about a small Californian town which gets attacked by deadly birds one day. These birds don&#x27;t appear until 45 minutes into the film, so there&#x27;s also a lot more to this film. The most notable thing is that the movie follows the main character&#x27;s full day, and I&#x27;m not kidding. You get to see him driving, working and eating. And these sequences are long, and also pointless. Already after the introduction, you start noticing how poorly made this film is. The sound quality is very bad, and the track often goes to very quiet to very loud. The video quality isn&#x27;t very good either, but since I&#x27;m a indie movie maker myself I don&#x27;t have any problems with that. But the script, directing and most of all acting is so poor.Alan Bagh who plays the main character in Birdemic, is the worst actor I&#x27;ve ever seen in a movie. He just looks so bored and uninspired in all of his scenes. The supporting actors are still a bit better, but that doesn&#x27;t save the movie. It is when the birds arrives that you really start noticing how poorly made this film is.The birds looks awful. They look so fake and they&#x27;re all the same. The birds literally just attack the humans by basically flying in front of them. These special effects are also what makes the movie so funny and bad. The scenes are so far away from horror as possible. And the birds make a sound that gives you an headache within a second.The movie continues to be a bad film throughout. Everything about this movie is so bad. But as I said, I think everyone should still watch this. It is the best worst movie ever, but someone actually spent time doing this. And I appreciate it more than modern art.	1
Birdemic a study on why just because you have a video camera doesnt mean you should make a movie	None	Well I just watched the RiffTrax version of the movie and still wanted to bash my brains out with a 2x4 full of rusty nails. Mostly due to the fact that this movie could be used as a torture device for any human being that is a fan of the cinematic art form known as moving pictures. Their are some movies so god awful that they are fun to watch I.E. Sharknado and The Happening. The main difference between those pieces of dog sh*t and this piece of dog sh*t is that this movie thinks its being artsy and delivering a brilliant subtle world altering message while assuming that the audience has the intelligence level of the week old splooge inside the jeans of a ten year old boy tragically born with fetal alcohol syndrome. The movie proves how dumb it believes its audience to be by making all of Rod&#x27;s business deals with NTC software end in nice even round numbers like 1 million dollars and 1 billion dollars. Then he creates a company in a week and its immediately financed by the dumbest and or laziest venture capitalist group in the world for a nice even 10 million dollars. Then when literally out of nowhere the Birdemic hits for no plausible reason whatsoever the movie starts bashing us over the head with global warming propaganda that was written by that same ten year old with fetal alcohol syndrome I mentioned earlier. This movie was made slightly bearable by the guys at RiffTrax because at least they made me laugh but this movie has made me hate people named Rod and if ever a Victoria Secret cover model walks up to me I&#x27;m running away in fear and immediately relapsing on a lethal dose of Heroin you know just in case she even slightly reminds me of this waste of 1.3 GB that the servers of the world will never get back! Oh and yeah forgot to mention that Rod&#x27;s girlfriend for the movie is a Victoria Secret cover model because we wouldn&#x27;t know she was a hot soulless mouth breathing waste of oxygen unless the movie told us she was a model! P.S. I&#x27;m also an Afghanistan veteran and they manage to throw a why can&#x27;t we all just get along line from an marine and Iraqi war veteran which is the only realistic part of the movie Army rules Marine Corp. drools na ni na ni boo boo! (sticks tongue out and makes farty noises)	1
A must see, Highly entertaining	Oslo	Where should I start - This movie is so poorly made, it&#x27;s an artform. Of course this has been done on purpose; but It is not easy to make something as poor as this movie. It is highly entertaining, I haven&#x27;t laughed this much watching a movie ever. The animated clipart birds, explosions and the other effects - (cut and paste) is simply incredible. The story line, random politics, romance, the dialogues, the acting... so incredibly poor; How did they do it? Considering it is so poor, it is so entertaining I wanted to give it a 10 out of 10, but that would not be fair, as this is the worst movie ever - and doesn&#x27;t deserve to lose it&#x27;s pole position at the IMDb bottom 100.	1
This movie	United States	Well kids gather around its time for a story about a movie that is like ktulu in the fact that looking at it will drive you to madness. This movie made me rethink my life and why I was willing to waste my time alive watching this. First the birdemic starts 45 min into the story and you couldn&#x27;t really care less at this point your looking off into space wishing you could just Cobain yourself and end it all but no still more movie. The birds in this movie look just awful. These birds apparently have the ability to hover in front of people because reasons. Also little known fact you can fight off birds with coat hangers. All the people that die in this movie die of stupidly as everyone seems to pullover and roll there windows down and let the birds claw them to death. On top of that they try to hit you over the head with anti global warming and Iraq bull that your really not in the mood to hear at this point. This movie is one of those special films that make other movies look better. Watch this and you&#x27;ll never complain about how bad a movie is again this makes the catwoman, the room, and sharknadio look astounding. By the way the ending is bad to. I still am torn between laughing my self to death and flying into a rage after realizing I had actually sat threw the whole thing. DON&#x27;T SEE THIS MOVIE	1
Bore-demic: Schlock and Terrible!	California	I&#x27;m convinced the people who say this movie is &#x22;The best worst movie ever!&#x22; haven&#x27;t actually SEEN the whole thing, and are only commenting on abridged versions from YouTube clips. This things kinda a bore.Don&#x27;t get me wrong. There ARE some (unintentionally) hilarious parts (mostly when our &#x22;heroes&#x22; get attacked by a particularly vengeful Playstation game...er I mean &#x22;birds&#x22;) However the GCI atrocities don&#x27;t even show up until the movies halfway point and only pop up occasionally afterwords. Like many other bad movies, this has massive pacing problems making the film a very dull slog. So what do we get while we&#x27;re waiting for the Winged Clip-Art of Doom to strike? We get an ENDLESS supply of driving and parking scenes that, if cut, would render the remaining footage about 15 minutes long. (And bad driving scenes to boot. These have all the thrill of Driving Miss Daisy, even AFTER the squawking GIFs start attacking.) And then about 13 of THOSE minutes is filled with pointless character after pointless character filibustering about global warming or some environmentalist issue told in that oh-so exciting &#x22;Guess-what-I-copied-directly-from- Wikipedia-without-actually-reading?&#x22; tone of voice. I kept waiting for Captain Planet and the Ferngully fairy to show up and rant about how unsubtle it all is. For the lover in you we even get a turgid &#x22;romance&#x22; between two pieces of plywood...er our heroes (You&#x27;ll never look at a pumpkin festive the same again.)But like I said there are SOME amusing moments to dull the pain, if you like seeing marble-mouthed dull-witted leading man who walk with the limber gait of the Frankenstein monster, plenty of flubbed lines that show that the word &#x22;retake&#x22; is not in directors vocabulary, the most jaded assemble of extras ever (a Birdemic is no reasons traffic in the background can&#x27;t proceed as normal, right?), inept salesmen who CHEER when they lose one million dollars on a sale, and of course site of our no-talent cast pretending to interact with special (ed?) effects eagles that would look poorly rendered on a circa-1997 Geocities website. But those are just an oasis of hilarious ineptitude in a painfully dull sea of padding. Maybe it&#x27;s easier to deal with as a group or &#x22;audience&#x22; to share the misery, but otherwise this is slow, plodding mess.	1
Birdemic review	None	I do not write reviews often, but this time i strongly felt the need to say something since this movie is ranked as the second worst movie of all times. And its a pretty big compliment for a mediocre project like this. I had to call Birdemic a project, not a film, not on the merits of production quality but for the ambiguous intentions of the filmmaker.Its not fun, funny, cult or interestingly bad, its just rubbish. Big mistake someone decided to produce and distribute this piece of work. Filmmaker could be an attention seeking muppet or over-confident prick, but distributing, watching and helping others to watch this movie does not justify any of this.Also people should be warned that this movie is not what it seems to be: a mockery of Hitchcocks&#x27; Birds, a criticism to polished film making or a tribute to B-movies (such as often mentioned Manos: Hands of Fate, rightfully labelled as one of the worst movies of all times).Lets be clear, it is not one of the &#x27;too good because its too bad&#x27; movies. Its downright boring. Amateur acting, constant panning of dull locations in establishing shots, lazy SFX and mediocre script. If it were to be extremely bad (or obviously tried to be bad), we could have a laugh. But not even that happens. I wont argue individuals right to disagree, and there is a bunch of people who find this movie entertaining. Educational, cultural, social and economic backgrounds create great depths between IMDb users.However, the only thing that Birdemic got right is &#x27;the shock and terror&#x27;.. which came from the boredom and idiocy it creates. Its a total waste of time, and does not stand to the buzz it creates. Im giving a 3*, because it doesn&#x27;t deserve the lowest rating.Final words: you have been awarned! Do NOT watch this movie (unless you are forced to), at least not pay for it. And also, do not watch any movie from anyone associated with Birdemic.	2
Aahm. .. kind of ... sh.t.	Hungary	The storyline is quite good, the visual effects are awful. The eagles actually attacking the people around are actually images. They are not even lighted well. No consequences at all. Nonsense, this movie is just nonsense. Grammatical difficulties in the dialogs, illogical scene order. Even bad actors. Bad cut, bad after-work. If I can advise you something, please don&#x27;t crucify yourself with watching that film. However, if you watch through that all, you can say &#x27;I&#x27;ve just wasted my time to watch the two parts of Birdemic, yeah man! :) &#x27; Just walk your dog, cat, goldfish... something... I can assure you, You will not enjoy that film because of the failed special effects. Terrible. There&#x27;s a scene where the forest is burning... Lighting spots on trees, with gray lines (smoke). Very sad.	1
Why...Just...why?	None	This movie made the room look like a masterpiece its terrible acting, terrible set,awful cgi effects,and weird audio cuts during dialouge,I can&#x27;t find anything good to offer in this film,I actually procrastinated this review multiple times because i couldn&#x27;t finish the &#x22;movie&#x22;,atleast the room has a cult following,but not birdemic oh no this film has a following but its not at cult status thats how bad it is,not to mention the first hour out of the 1:31:10 running time of the film is nothing but pointless sequences that have nothing to do with the film and i swear they used a 8 mm camera to film this,for a 2010 release it has poor visual qualities and the audio OH GOD! the audio you can clearly hear the audio cuts when it alternates between the &#x22;actors&#x22; talking it&#x27;s choppy and gets very annoying after the first 30 seconds of the film,it has out of context music that makes a car ride look like a super fun adventure to the shire,and how come this apparently abandoned city has hundreds of cars passing by?,and I can&#x27;t stop thinking about how this movie exist at all,In conclusion This movie should be passed up unless you&#x27;re a fan of bad movies.	1
Shock and Terrible Movie	Cedarburg Wi	Not a good movie but there is something about this movie that is in a way kind of entertaining. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say that its &#x22;so bad that its good&#x22; it&#x27;s not like the room, but you can&#x27;t help but laugh at how stupid this movie is from cheap film equipment, lame music, less then decent actors, and the angles the film were shot from which for some reason were always shot at a Dutch angle. The story is pretty boring for half the movie considering the birds don&#x27;t appear till 45-50 into the movie and during that time the movie is as boring as standing in line at the DMV and talking about global warming despite the fact that global warming wouldn&#x27;t explain the birdemic. Finally the quality of the film was terrible, I&#x27;ve seen YouTube movies made by teenage boys with a video camera costing no more than a few hundred dollars that were better than birdemic.	3
I literally caught Cancer from this film.	None	After watching this film my life expectancy has become so close to my current age it physically defies the laws of mathematics. I can not express the sheer volume of visual AIDS I have contracted over the last 1:30 of my now worthless existence. My advice is, If you value yours or anyone who may catch a glimpse of this films vital organs, steer clear. Literally, my kidney is on the floor shrilled and staring back at me with an expression that screams &#x27;why?&#x27;. I have been forced to sap my grandma&#x27;s life support machine to warn others of this atrocity (She won&#x27;t be needing it after watching this film). To save my dog from this retinal mutilation, I was forced snap it&#x27;s and all 7 of its puppies necks. So to conclude, because of this film I will not live to see sunrise, I have visual AIDS, my only remaining organ is a nearly unrecognisably deformed lung, my grandma and our 8 dogs are dead.Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, As it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, As we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, The power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.	10
Worst movie ever, that you MUST watch (So bad its good)	Latvia	This is probably the biggest disaster in film making history ever. Plot is boring and doesn&#x27;t make sense for the most time, acting and dialogue is atrocious and I could probably make better CGI using some free apps on my phone.But... It&#x27;s brilliant at the same time. Well brilliant if you enjoy such disasters as Troll 2 and The Room (2003). This is by far my favourite movie in &#x22;so bad it&#x27;s good&#x22; category. And the best part - they were dead serious when making this. I still have a hard time believing that, but it&#x27;s a fact. I don&#x27;t want to spoiler anything by mentioning some of the best parts in this masterpiece, just watch it yourself.By the way trailer is just a tip of the iceberg. By watching this I guarantee you - you haven&#x27;t seen such comedy (although it wasn&#x27;t meant to be such)	1
Greatest Thing ever made, on the same level as Pacific Rim and other Apocalypse movies.	USA	I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s all fuss is about.I watched this movie about 3 times and every single time I am left with a great feeling of satisfaction.The acting in this masterpiece is top notch,Alan Bagh&#x27;s and Whitney Moore&#x27;s performance is Oscar worthy.I have never seen such an emotion from any actors since Matthew Wolf from Transmorphers. In addition the CGI is outstanding, some of the action scenes left me speechless. If I were to compare the visuals in Birdemic I would compare it to Pacific Rim, New Godzilla and even Jurassic Park.Now the plot is on the same level as every movie Christopher Nolan ever made. I absolutely loved a 2 minute opening without single cut. Everything in this movie is great...from camera work to audio quality and acting.Now if you excuse me I am gonna go and re watch my favorite movies such as sequel to Biremic which is not as great but still really, really good and The Terminators which is 10x better than Cameron&#x27;s Transformers.	3
The ultimate piece of trash	Tanzania	This was by far the worst piece of trash movie I&#x27;ve ever forced my eyes to see. I cried for 2 days straight because of how ignorantly disgusting the effects, story and the acting were. It reminded me of the time I had bloody diarrhea and a broken leg at the same time. This is disgusting and the director and anyone that participated in the making of this horse excrement of a movie should be publicly hanged and have their genitalia chopped off and fed to crows and pigeons(the females should be chemically sterilized). Please pull this pathetic excuse for a movie off of this site forever and shame the director so he doesn&#x27;t ever make an another piece of garbage such as this. Also have him pay for the therapy I am in need of after watching this. Thank you.	1
Why would birds do something like that...?	Denmark	I will start out by saying that I should have taken heed and paid attention to the big flashing warning signs here on IMDb for this movie. The low rating and the shoddy reviews should have raised my alarms. But still, I like to watch all kinds of movies and even give questionable movies a chance.But &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22; was just beyond bad. The storyline is slow, dumb and mindbogglingly unappealing. For starters you have to get very far into the movie before anything starts to happen, and even when it does start, it is just horrible to bear witness to.I have seen many a questionable movies in my time, but &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22; definitely takes the lead in regards of lousy editing, both in sound and visual. The cutting was awful, and the sound was all over the place - sometimes proper sound, other times with a great deal of interfering static sound layer on it. It was as if the movie had been filmed with ordinary home video camera equipment.The dialog in the movie was forced, wooden and staggering, delivered without any conviction by anyone in the movie. Which leads to the next aspect; the acting. Wow, this was low budget and B-movie to the extend where your eyes were on the brink of bleeding.Then lets stop for a while and take a look at the CGI effects. I am of course talking about the CGI animated birds. Wow! Are you kidding me? It was so awfully fake and horrible to look at that you just sit there dumbstruck and thinking &#x27;oh no they didn&#x27;t, I didn&#x27;t just witness that...&#x27;Super poorly animated birds that wouldn&#x27;t even fool a blind man! Really? And just when you thought you had seen everything, this movie puts a new definition to the term &#x27;bad&#x27;. Would it be considered poorly-animated-bird-cruelty when you see the same bird being killed four times within one minute? This was just bad, they used the same clip of questionably animated bird being shot four times within one minute, but it gets better; one scene they mirrored the image.The scene where Rod, Nathalie and Ramsey were fighting off the birds with tools had me going back to see it twice. It was just that poor! It is unfathomable that something this bad could see the light of day in 2010. And for some reason people die in this movie when a bird flies in front of their face for a couple of seconds.&#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22; makes Troma movies look grand and astonishing. And it is just an appalling thought to know that there is a part 2 to this disaster. &#x22;Birdemic: Shock and Terror&#x22; makes it to the top three of horrible movies that I have seen, without a doubt.	1
Truly awful	Tokyo, Japan	This is the worst film ever made. It looks like an amateur film project. The cameras are very low quality and the filming is really bad. They could have used the money to buy better equipment. A $300 camera would suffice. Even I could make something better than &#x22;Birdemic&#x22;, and I know nothing about production. Not even &#x22;The Room&#x22; comes close.The acting is equivalent to something you&#x27;d find in porn. The soundtrack consists of cheesy stock music, and both the sound and visual effects are mediocre. They also chose some really poor locations for the scenes. The characters are not pricks like in The Room, but most of them are fillers, especially Rod&#x27;s friend and Mai (the Asian girl). Speaking about characters, Rod and Nathalie are super successful. Nathalie is a model and Rod is a software engineer/salesman. Everything is going well in their lives. They were also one of the only people to survive the attacks. &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; was made to teach people about environmental causes like global warming, forest fires, etc... so the film is full of blatant propaganda. For example, Mai wears a shirt with &#x22;IMAGINE PEACE&#x22; written on it, and Rod buys and sells solar panels. The characters also find a ornithologist on their journey and a &#x22;tree hugger&#x22; with a $1.99 wig.So, in short, &#x22;Birdemic&#x22; is truly awful, and the worst of all is that it&#x27;s completely serious.	1
Worst Movie Ive Ever Seen	None	FROM THE BEGINNING, the very first line of the movie did not sync with the actresses&#x27; lips. The first half of the movie is this terrible love story between Rod and Nathalie (Nat). Their entire relationship felt forced and awkward. There is ZERO character development with everyone except Rod and Nat. Everyone else just felt unneeded, unwanted, and in the way. Then after an awkward sex scene (if we can call it that), THEN the killer birds attack for seemingly NO REASON AT ALL! They crash into buildings with these explosions that are just hilariously bad looking video effects. And these birds feel like someone took 1 bird in flash animation, had it do one motion and copied and pasted it. And the damn sounds are just terrible. At one point, while these killer birds are outside, the 6 of them, which we JUST MET 4 of them, decide to have a MOTHERF**KING PICNIC! OUT-F**KING-SIDE WITH KILLER BIRDS! WTF!?! And I can&#x27;t stand the children in the movie. Those ungrateful little brats. The first thing the little girl says is that she wants a happy meal. THERE ARE KILLER BIRDS OUTSIDE AND YOU&#x27;RE WORRIED ABOUT MCDONALDS!? WTF! OH! And can&#x27;t forget this part: At one point there are these people on a double decker bus who are completely safe from the birds. Well, 1 of the actors decides that he needs to force them OFF the bus. As SOON as they get off the bus, they DIE! DICK MOVE! Then at the end, the birds just leave.... THAT&#x27;S IT! THEY JUST TURN AROUND AND LEAVE! A few people die, yea, but that&#x27;s it. They kill and leave. What the hell? I can&#x27;t believe someone actually released this. Terrible. Just freakin terrible. There were other things in this movie that made me mad but just see it for yourself. Or better yet, don&#x27;t.	1
Birdemic review	United States	Well, I went into this expecting some all-out &#x22;so bad it&#x27;s good&#x22; charm, but holy crap! Children can make better films than this! The story is abysmal. It spends nearly forty minutes on the lamest and most un-dynamic love story ever filmed. When the &#x22;birdemic&#x22; finally hits, there&#x27;s no good reasoning or explanation for anything (and certainly no explanation for why all the birds leave at the end). It&#x27;s all blamed on global warming. Yep, then the film goes on to shove global warming into the audience&#x27;s faces at every turn. Because, apparently, it will cause birds to freak out and turn into GIF files that zoom along with airplane sound effects and can spontaneously combust.The actual bird attack is the lamest thing ever committed to film. The birds are so cheap, and they tend to hover in place and incessantly repeat the same stock sound effects over and over again. They go on to dive-bomb everything and explode in cheap-looking explosions.Acting? Terrible across the board. Writing? Just as terrible. Production? This film was probably made with pocket change. Filming? So very pedestrian. Sound quality? My God, the sound was the worst. It kept cutting in and out, with dialogue and sound getting cut off randomly. At first, I thought the disc was screwed up.There are some scenes that go on for far too long. The beginning credits are a hoot; it&#x27;s like five minutes of nonstop driving and driving and driving, with the same music looping two or three times. Same goes for the film&#x27;s final shots.There&#x27;s easily a thousand other things wrong with this picture. You can laugh at it. You can pick it apart and pour all your hatred into it. You can get bored and walk away. For the most part, the former applies the best, so long as you are open to such bad cinema and can find enough good humor to take this film as it is. It&#x27;s certainly up there on the &#x22;so bad it&#x27;s good&#x22; meter, and would likely supersede most of the films shown on the SyFy channel (take that, Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus!).1.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Awful | Film: Awful)	3
Terrible, Just Terrible	United States	A platoon of eagles and vultures attacks the residents of a small town. Many people die. It is not known what caused the flying menace to attack. Two people manage to fight back, but will they survive Birdemic? Where to begin on this one? The acting (and I use the word &#x22;acting&#x22; loosely) is among the worst I have ever seen, the computer-generated birds are not even plausibly real, and why is there a &#x22;minivan militia&#x22; that drives around with assault rifles for just such an emergency? This film makes &#x22;The Room&#x22; look like &#x22;Shawshank Redemption&#x22;, but it is really hard to rate. On its merits, it clearly deserves the lowest possible rating (and it is no surprise this has achieved the honor of being on the IMDb Bottom 100). However, much like &#x22;The Room&#x22;, it is thoroughly entertaining in its badness. Watching this in a theater full of hecklers and you could have the time of your life. Yet, it even stops being funny in the third act.The film has been described as &#x22;Birds&#x22; meets &#x22;An Inconvenient Truth&#x22; (both for very obvious reasons). I am confused by the environmental message... they go beyond the &#x22;pounding it into our heads&#x22; stage -- polar bears, tree-huggers, John Lennon references, solar panels... it is more annoying than anything else.	3

Angry Birds:  The Full-Length Movie	United States	If you&#x27;re in the mood for a b-movie, this is it. See this one. It takes almost a full hour for their to be any violent birds, at all. Not only are the birds poorly edited in .gif files, but they explode on impact half the time. And Alan Bagh needs to start conveying emotions. He always sounds disinterested or sarcastic. And I&#x27;m not so sure people can die from a bird scratching their face a little bit. And that poster in the movie that said, &#x22;Imagine Peace: Imaginepeace.com&#x22; Don&#x27;t go there. I went there for 3 seconds, and saw the name Yoko Ono.The plot to this movie is so inconsistent. A man makes success in the stock market. He meets a girl. They start dating. Birds attack. A scientist confirms that the birds have bird flu. Then warns the cast about global warming, but that&#x27;s not why the birds attacked. They wander into the forest. A tree hugging mountain man warns them about global warming and bark beetles. They get 4 people on a bus killed. The birds fly out to sea despite the fact they&#x27;re not eagles. I think Alan Bagh was just using this movie as a pick-up line. He met Whitney Moore, asked her if she wanted to be in a movie, and hoped that would be enough to convince her to sleep with him. I doubt it worked.In short: James Nguyen is the France of cinema. Bad movie, fun to watch. Can&#x27;t wait for Birdemic II: The Resurrection in 3-D.	2
No error went uncommitted!	United States	I can&#x27;t decide whether to give 1 or 10 stars. I laughed far more at this than any of the newer so-called comedies coming out of Hollywood lately. The sound, the music, the editing, the acting, the casting, the writing -- all 100% maximally bad. What other movie can make you laugh at the main character just walking? I laughed at the driving scenes! I laughed at almost every line! It is exquisitely and precisely bad in every way and it&#x27;s consistently bad all the way through! I find it hard to believe it isn&#x27;t a prank pulled on us by a very sophisticated director, but there is no evidence that Nguyen has any idea what he&#x27;s doing. It&#x27;s just that bad! Awesome! If you watched Troll 2 because you thought it was the worst movie ever, I have news for you. Troll 2 only wishes it was this bad. Birdemic might even be worse than The Room. Might.	1
Plan 10	Greece	You have two options to consider while watching this devastatingly bad work. One is that there are filmmakers who are really this inept and clueless about the mechanics of film and nonetheless are passionately drawn to make them anyway, people like Coleman Francis or Ed Wood. Entertain the possibility that there are people this quixotic and open about a dream who will just throw themselves into it, risking time and money.They may fail of course, dismally so, in the same way most of us would if we were insane and spontaneous enough to quit our day jobs. But you have to consider the option that Hal Warren, the guy who made Manos, was as honest as can be when he said &#x22;Always give 110% in everything you do, if you don&#x27;t give it your all, there is no sense in doing it at all.&#x22; The other option to consider is that there are people like PT Barnum around, savvy business minds who know we&#x27;re suckers for idiotic monstrosity of every sort. These are not modern-day half-mad shamans who will venture beyond common sense to grant us a vision of the sublime ridiculous, or village idiots who will now and then reveal an intuition in their ramblings, but cunning peddlers plying a trade for money. Bad movies. As good as any other craft.This latter case is a more recent phenomenon, I believe in keeping with all the other junk of postmodern ironic culture. Highly self-conscious patchwork exploiting tribal communication. Knowing this makes you one of a shared, preferably small group. This is more like The Room and less than Plan 9. It&#x27;s woeful in every respect but trusts we&#x27;re ironic enough to cheer every exploding digital bird (!). We cheer on, hoping it actually gets worse and more senseless. Plan 10 is deliberate badness. Troma knows all about this.	1
Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2010)	United Kingdom	As awful as you&#x27;ve heard, but a bit disappointing in its awfulness as it doesn&#x27;t even try. How can I laugh at something when it never tried in the first place? What is hilarious is the director&#x27;s deluded idea that this may help the environment. It&#x27;s littered with painful dialogue such as &#x22;I&#x27;m getting a hybrid car&#x22;, and a whole scene of the protagonist purchasing some solar panels. It&#x27;s also painfully annoying, with the same 20 seconds of music played on a loop and just 2 sound effects for the birds. No editing where sound is concerned makes for a film that&#x27;s hard to understand at times, as dialogue is swamped by background noise. Not funny, not exciting, not creative, just terrible. Pure shite!	1
Worst Movie	Turkey(USAF)	This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen, and I&#x27;v seen Monsturd and Mega Piranha. The only reason I&#x27;ve given this film 2 stars is because the chick is hot. It is impossible to give a film a zero on IMDb. Some advice when watching the film. Do not eat or drink while the movie is playing, I almost choked after the first line. The audio is so bad. You could seriously die if you are not careful. I could not get drunk enough while watching this because I was afraid of dieing. I wanted to pull out what little hair I have left and just scream until I pass out or die. If I would have watched that while hammered, the room I was in would have been utterly destroyed. I was screaming so much during this film, not because it was scary, but because it was awful. No idea how it got picked up to be distributed, I even bought it on Blu-Ray.	2
absolutely hilarious	Earth	purely awful... In the words of Jodie Foster (while crying) &#x22;There are no words...they should have sent a poet&#x22; to describe the depths of this atrocity. It&#x27;s so bad it crosses from the realm of terrible into ironically good back into terrible again and then finally making a stop at vomit inducing hilarity.OH and if you wanna make the movie even funnier. Go to Rifftrax.com and download the audio supplemental track. (They are the writers and stars of Mystery Science Theater 300)... its cheap and i guarantee that if you find this movie to be funny then you will love this audio track.if you need anymore recommendations for shitty movies just send me a message though the IMDb site.	2
So bad its...still bad but its really funny!	United States	Birdemic is a masterpiece....I think.Everything about this movie is wrong Just...wrong. The plot makes no sense, the acting is extremely wooden and the male lead can&#x27;t even walk right! The male actor is so bad I&#x27;m not sure how he even go a part in any movie. He&#x27;s just so terrible! He acts like how I would have aced in my kindergarten play. I think they found him in some kind of special Ed class and put him in the movie. The female sucks too. When you think it couldn&#x27;t get any worse (Or better) than the birds come out! Damn. This is a must watcfh, but only for people who can really enjoy it and find it funny. Or again, just watch with rifftrax.	1
Wow! Fantastic! Great! Amazing! Captivating!	United States	My summary says it all. If you are a person who likes to watch bad movies.....this is the one for you! From the opening scene and the 3:30 of drive time I knew I was in for a really bad movie.Glitter, Death To Smoochy, From Justin to Kelly, Gigli are classics compared to Birdemic: Shock and Terror.You will be &#x22;Shocked and Terrorized after watch this fantastic movie.I had a 5th of Cpt. Morgan when I watched it the second time.If you dare......watch Birdemic 2: The Resurrection, I highly recommend that you have 2 5th&#x27;s while watching that masterpiece.It is so good I watched it again along with Rubber, and Teeth during a long rainy weekend.	10
Without a Doubt a Must-See Movie	Louisville, KY	Birdemic: Shock and Terror (2010) BOMB (out of 4) Rod (Alan Bagh) and Nathalie (Whitney Moore) start a romantic love affair just as Global Warming causes eagles and vultures to go on the attack. Will the duo make it out alive and will humans realize that Global Warming is a very serious threat? BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR is an extremely low-budget movie that pretty much came out of nowhere, hit the midnight circuit and became a cult favorite to thousands of people across the globe. Obviously, the film has gained its reputation due to how incredibly bad it is and there&#x27;s no doubt that whatever you read or hear can&#x27;t really prepare you for how rotten this thing is. Lets just say that there&#x27;s really not a single good thing in this picture other than the fact that it&#x27;s hard to make a movie so you can at least give director-writer James Nguyen credit for doing that. The rest of this thing is just downright awful from the screenplay to the cinematography to the sound effects to the acting to the special effects and everything else that takes up space here. I mean, the illogical nature of the story is something that truly deserves comparisons to Edward D. Wood, Jr.. Yes, I know it&#x27;s the hip thing to do these days, comparing something to the work of Wood but this film deserves it. So, birds are attacking people everywhere yet our group of heroes decide to stop and have a picnic? The group of heroes are trying to escape the birds so they go to the woods where there&#x27;s nothing but trees? There are so many logical issues with this film that you really can&#x27;t help but laugh. Even worse are the countless speeches in the film where people talk about the dangers of Global Warming. Then, for an unknown reason, the first fifty or so minutes of the movie are devoted to this incredibly bad love story that is just creepy to say the least. I think the worst thing in the picture would have to be the editing. When you watch a movie it&#x27;s supposed to have a natural flow to it but the editing here is so poor that you really can&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;re watching. BIRDEMIC: SHOCK AND TERROR is without question one of the worst movies ever made and I haven&#x27;t even started talking about the awful CGI birds. Without question this here is a must-see.	2
