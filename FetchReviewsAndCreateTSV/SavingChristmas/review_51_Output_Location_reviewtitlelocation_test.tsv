Krik explains to his brother-in-law that Christmas is all about Jesus, but it isnt how his brother-in-law things.	Decatur, Alabama	I loved the movie!!! It isn&#x27;t really made for lost people. It&#x27;s for Christians, and it has amazing points in it!!! It allows viewers to see Christmas in a different way than they ever have before!!! If you don&#x27;t love Jesus then I wouldn&#x27;t say you should go see it. However, if you do love Jesus then you gotta go see this movie. If you think people are no longer focused on Jesus during this time of year then you really need to go see it. I was amazed at some of the things Krik said because I have read and heard the stories he spoke of, but I have never put two and two together. The movie is a must see for any believer, and it&#x27;s very family friendly.	10
