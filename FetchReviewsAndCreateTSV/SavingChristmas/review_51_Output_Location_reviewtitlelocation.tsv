An interminable, shoddily-researched lecture masquerading as comedy	Lincoln, NE	For those of us who have watched Kirk Cameron pontificate on the wonders of the banana, or read his musings on the legitimacy of the existence of fire-breathing dragons, we know that Kirk Cameron himself is comedy gold. One might expect more hilarity from Cameron in Saving Christmas, but Cameron actually intentionally tries to build a comedy here, and the result is an unfunny, unfocused, interminable mess.The film begins with an uncomfortable scene involving Kirk Cameron sitting in a chair, lecturing at the audience. &#x22;They don&#x27;t want us to love Christmas,&#x22; Cameron declares authoritatively, never bothering to define exactly who &#x22;they&#x22; are. Cameron drones on for several more minutes, and at this point in the film, I heard a kid in the back of the theater yawn loudly&#x97;perhaps an audible protest that this film would not be the exciting romp promised on the poster.Finally, the film cuts away from Kirk Cameron, and we see several characters enjoying a Christmas party. But then we see Kirk Cameron again, the film freezes, and we hear Kirk Cameron narrating about himself: &#x22;That&#x27;s me&#x97;Kirk!&#x22; More lecturing ensues.Eventually, a character by the name of Christian (almost as clever as &#x22;Josh Wheaton&#x22;), a Christian himself, despondently finds his way to a car, apparently disillusioned by the materialism of Christmas. Enter Kirk Cameron, who enters the vehicle and does what he does best&#x97;more lecturing.The majority of the film takes place in this car as Kirk lectures to Christian, with occasional cutaways to Biblical imagery. Cameron tries to make the case that Christmas traditions, such as celebratory trees and gifts, all somehow originated with Christianity, not paganism. (Never mind the fact that ancient paganism predates Christianity.) &#x22;Last time I checked, God created the winter solstice!&#x22; is the type of asinine reasoning you&#x27;ll hear from Kirk Cameron throughout the film. Cameron&#x27;s facts are both dubious and sparse, and his connections are spurious&#x97;but Christian is nevertheless invariably blown away by Kirk Cameron&#x27;s apparently amazing insight.Perhaps aware that interminable lecturing on its own would be unbearable for an audience, the film provides characters with quirky personalities in an effort to break up the tedium. In particular, we are treated to a scene back in the house of two characters rambling schizophrenically as they drink hot chocolate. It has nothing to do with Christian&#x27;s story, it makes the movie feel unfocused, it goes on for far too long, and if my theater is any indication, it is not funny at all. In fact, there was dead silence in my theater throughout the entire run of this &#x22;comedy&#x22; film.The film ends with a dance sequence that feels like it lasts ten minutes, as well as multiple, gratuitous blooper scenes&#x97;I suppose for no reason other than to pad the running time. Just when you think it&#x27;s finally over, we see Kirk Cameron again, and he continues to lecture the audience&#x97;this time about how materialism is just fine, because Jesus came to us in a material body, after all.One gets the impression that Kirk Cameron actually started reading his own Bible, was disturbed by what he found (such as Jesus&#x27; instruction to &#x22;go sell your possessions and give to the poor&#x22;), and produced this film as a desperate justification for his own hypocrisy.At my theater, nobody laughed, and nobody stayed for the end credits. This purported comedy film fails at every level. If you&#x27;re really looking for a laugh, go back and take a look at what Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort have to say about the glorious design of the banana.	1
A yuletide atrocity	United States	It&#x27;s no secret that, on both the mainstream and independent circuit of film, Christian cinema has been a big focus in 2014. Films like &#x22;Heaven is for Real,&#x22; &#x22;Noah,&#x22; &#x22;Son of God,&#x22; and next month&#x27;s &#x22;Exodus: Gods and Kings&#x22; have all catered to the faithful in some way and have gone on to achieve uniformly strong financial numbers as well. The independent circuit has seen big hits like &#x22;God&#x27;s Not Dead&#x22; and marginal successes like &#x22;Left Behind,&#x22; &#x22;Mom&#x27;s Night Out,&#x22; &#x22;Persecuted,&#x22; and &#x22;When the Game Stands Tall,&#x22; all of which finding ways to connect with their target audience in at least recognizing their faith in the cinema, a place where it&#x27;s fair to believe the religious demographic has felt ignored. Former Television star and devout, outspoken Christian Kirk Cameron has now thrown his hat in the ring, latching on to this newfound trend, and effectively making not only the worst film of its genre but the worst film of 2014. &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas&#x22; is a disjointed mess, structurally pathetic and morally bankrupt as we watch scenes interwoven with little coherency, dialog written and delivered in its most wooden form, and wonderful morals to teach our children, like &#x22;materialism is good.&#x22; The film begins with Cameron sitting in a blatantly artificial living room, decorated with more Christmas lights and flair than Macy&#x27;s after Thanksgiving passes, giving us an introduction to the film at hand. He states the biggest problem with the Christmas season is the &#x22;people&#x22; who want to segregate the spread of faith and good cheer to the private homes of those who celebrate the holiday or simply want the holiday done away with all together. He rambles on for about three minutes as the introduction sets the perfect theme for this film; it&#x27;s a circumventing project that never results in a specific or thoughtfully-articulated point.We cut to a Christmas party held by Cameron&#x27;s sister, where a Santa has been hired, the tree has been erected, the house has been decorated, a feast has been prepared, and everyone is in an incorruptibly cheery mood; everyone except Cameron&#x27;s brother-in-law Christian (director Darren Doane), who is seen moping around the house before quietly slipping away to his car. Kirk follows Christian and learns the materialism of Christmas bothers him immensely, as he watches kids beg for toys they won&#x27;t play with in three weeks and parents max out their credit cards, giving way to the materials and the illuminating tree in the center of the room, and all while neglecting the baby Jesus in the manger, who is the ultimate &#x22;reason for the season.&#x22;Cameron begins to initiate flashbacks to biblical times to &#x22;justify&#x22; why we have the Christmas traditions that we do. However, it&#x27;s not enough that we get a history lesson told from the enormously biased lens of Cameron, but in a dodgy and muddled manner. Cameron gets absorbed in the significance of baby Jesus&#x27;s swaddling cloth and the original mean-spirited roots of Saint Nicholas (something that will undoubtedly scare and confuse children), never addressing Christian&#x27;s true distaste for the holiday season. Kirk meanders for about forty minutes, talking himself in incoherent and redundant circles, never addressing Christian&#x27;s questions in a way that we can extract counterpoints or citing Christmas&#x27;s Pagan and cultist roots (if you&#x27;re going to show Saint Nicholas as a brute, at least address the backstory).Interjected in these ridiculously dry biblical flashbacks and in-car dialogs are exaggerated characters masquerading as likable people with personalities drawn so wide they are desperately unfunny. We see two party guests discuss &#x22;The War on Christmas,&#x22; relating it to several other conspiracy theories that just feels like a soundoff of paranoia. We get a few minutes of dead-end, annoying conversation and some of the worst displays of acting this year before it&#x27;s back to the car for a half-assed lecture. &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; ends with an abhorrent dance number to an incorrigible techno/rap hybrid, with members of the cast obnoxiously dancing and doing slow-motion choreography together. We end things with a perfunctory voice-over with Cameron before we&#x27;re greeted by almost ten minutes of closing credits showing bloopers, outtakes, and a barrage of other things padding this project to just barely being feature- length (eighty minutes). If my plot synopsis sounds like it has not made any sense, then I have effectively lived up to the structure and the narrative pace of this particular film.Just by comparing the full-length film to its trailer, you can tell &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; was Cameron&#x27;s last minute idea to cash in on the Christian cinema craze of the year. The trailer for the film talks about how Christmas has been corrupted by materialism and the political correctness of the holiday. However, Cameron blatantly contradicts his thesis when he states during the closing monologue that &#x22;materialism is good&#x22; because Christmas is about &#x22;God taking possession of a material body.&#x22; Aside from ushering in a pathetic excuse for a moral at the end of a film about Christmas, the cardinal sins committed here run amuck: a sloppy narrative hodgepodge of biblical flashbacks, inept lecturing, and pointless filler clearly padding a small runtime, atrocious acting on all fronts, a desperate attempt at &#x22;staying hip&#x22; and keeping the attention of the audience by throwing in a hip-hop dance number, contemptible morals, and failure to address or even stick to a cogent thesis. Kirk Cameron and company should be required to volunteer at local charities or help cater several breakfasts with Santa to make up for such a yuletide atrocity.	1
Kirk Camerons Low Budget Soapbox	United States	I created this account just to give this 1 star. That&#x27;s how bad it was. I went into this expecting a generic Christmas movie, and I didn&#x27;t even get that. The &#x22;plot&#x22; is awful. I put plot in quotation marks because I&#x27;m not even sure if this movie has one. Two guys walk out to a car and talk for an hour. That&#x27;s all that happens. It&#x27;s basically a feature length sermon, and a crappy one at that. There are literally NO redeeming qualities in this film. The camera work is extremely amateurish, and the acting and direction were absolutely abysmal. I had extremely low expectations for this, and it still managed to be disappointing. This movie is a total waste of time and money, and I honestly believe it&#x27;s the worst movie of 2014.	1
A horrifying cash grab	Australia	This movie is horrendous on so many levels - patronising to Christians, incredibly bad plot and direction, the acting and dialogue is as comfortable as a dentist&#x27;s visit. I suspect the whole thing is purely a desperate attempt by Cameron to pander to under-educated Christians in an effort to earn their hard earned dollars. Either that, or it is just a giant ego trip for him. I had no preconceptions before I went to watch this, and left confused as to the amount of utter garbage wedged into what seemed like an eternity of boredom. Even worse, he is asking his Christian supporters to bear false witness by skewing the votes here and on rotten tomatoes. Hypocritical? I&#x27;ll let you decide.	1
This movie is why a 0 star rating should be implemented on this site	None	Saving Christmas needed saving...and by that, I mean it should have been mercy killed. the acting is horrendous and it&#x27;s story is only a reminder that anyone that paid to see it wasted their money. Even if you are a die-hard Christian, please do not see this movie, it&#x27;s one of the worst movies you could ever watch ever, and considering stuff like The Room and Birdemic exists, That&#x27;s saying A lot. oh, and that thing Kirk Cameron&#x27;s doing to try to boost the rating on Rotten Tomatoes: Cameron, you should know the Bible verse &#x22;Thou shalt not bear false witness&#x22; it&#x27;s one of the 10 commandments. That&#x27;s all I have to say on this matter, Don&#x27;t watch the film. I mean Seriously Cameron, you should know better.	1
Not remotely funny, neither in the right nor wrong sense	Germany	I have to admit, that I hadn&#x27;t even planed to go to the movies on the day that I walked into &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22;. There was nothing on offer that interested me, so I turned to figure another way to squander my money. But then I saw the name &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x22;, saw that pasty face on the poster and two words came to my mind: &#x22;Crockoduck&#x22; and &#x22;Banana&#x22;! Yes, through the internet-memes and jokes I had been exposed to Cameron and his ilk. Upon realizing that those people were not comedians, I figured this was the most hilarious insane stuff I had heard in a long time and that Kirk Cameron may well be the missing brother of &#x22;Dumb and Dumber&#x22;. So I flashed the buck, walked in and expected much unintentional hilarity and future memes in the making.There were about 10 to 15 people sitting in the cinema, most with kids (I presume they were expecting a Christmas comedy). For a good deal of the beginning we are exposed to Cameron brattling on about some things or other, but it was mainly boring, nonsensical stuff that contained no (unintentional) comedy gold. Only when Kirk spouts that &#x22;god created winter solstice&#x22;, there was some chuckling to be heard. Not bad, but heard before (what hasn&#x27;t god created allegedly? Cars, air, shoes, bacteria, the universe and everything else, etc &#x96; this answer will give you a guaranteed A+ in any bible- or koran-school). At this point Cameron is sitting in some car with another guy and, like a true believer he keeps rambling and rambling and rambling. Nodded off for awhile but since I have a light sleep and get easily awoken by noise, I can only deduct that there was no joke missed since nobody had been laughing so far. At what I presume must have been the end of the &#x22;movie&#x22; there was some ridiculous dance-sequence (you know the type that should signify to the audience that they&#x27;re watching a &#x27;hip&#x27; film) and I decided to call it a day. As I turned to leave, I noticed that the cinema was empty and that I was the last rat to leave the sinking ship. So I left Kirk and his friends to dance to an empty cinema &#x96; and for all I know, they still dance there as I write.Look, we are all aware that people will believe much if only it gives them a crutch for reality. Virgins giving birth, horses flying from Mekka to Jerusalem overnight, zombies rising from the grave in order to bring world-peace, etc. It would be pointless (and perhaps even unkind) to point out that virgins cannot give birth, horses don&#x27;t fly and that the dead stay dead. But that&#x27;s were magic and science clash, alchemy has to make way or chemistry and believe hollers at common-sense and knowledge. Nothing new there, it&#x27;s been going on since the stone-age. But the stuff that Cameron and his ilk have formulated here (to put it kindly), that&#x27;s a whole new dimension of crazy. It reeks not only of fanatics but of self-serving. And the worst sin: this movie is boring, tedious and free of laughs, no matter which way you slice it.The lesson learned: it can be mildly amusing to watch a five minute YouTube video about a deranged guy, but giving him 80 minutes of your live, that&#x27;s simply not a good idea. It&#x27;s like holding a &#x27;deep&#x27; conversation with a bunch of jehova&#x27;s witness or the guy on the corner with the &#x22;the end is nigh&#x22;-sign &#x96; what&#x27;s the point if no real laughs are to be had? Just wait for the internet-meme; if there&#x27;s something worth laughing about, the &#x22;haters&#x22; will find and post if for sure (and it&#x27;s free!). &#x22;Jesus Camp&#x22; was funnier (and &#x22;Jesus Camp&#x22; was actually a very sad movie). This here is &#x22;IMDB Bottom-100&#x22;-material.Now, enough electronic ink wasted on this. Let&#x27;s make space for those who found the movie &#x22;exceptional&#x22;, &#x22;inspirational&#x22; and &#x22;great education&#x22; &#x96; you might be able to guess from which corner those come.What I give this tripe? Of course nothing. If you see a one point rating, it probably comes from god (pardon, meant to say IMDb)	1
Kirk Cameron isnt saving Christmas hes desecrating it	None	What&#x27;s wrong with this movie? There&#x27;s not enough time or space to cover all of it, so I&#x27;ll just share the main reasons why anyone who loves Jesus, His Word and His people should or would never watch this mockery of Christmas.&#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; is in direct violation of Romans 14:5-6 and 22-23, twists Scripture, reconstructs history and encourages gluttony.There&#x27;s nothing in this film that is &#x22;wholesome&#x22; and good for anyone, believer or non-believer.Let&#x27;s save others from Kirk and crew&#x27;s version of Christ&#x27;s first coming and celebrate (if your conscience allows) with reverence, awestruck wonder and with the true and great joy that envelopes all who are humbled by and grateful for God&#x27;s most amazing Gift--Jesus Christ, the one and only Son of God.http://www.sunnyshell.org/2014/10/kirk-camerons-saving-christmas.html	1
Notice how long the 10-star raters have been members, and how many movies theyve reviewed...	Pittsburgh, PA	First, let me state that in spite of the claims of Cameron and those who support him (and who have attempted to artificially raise this movie&#x27;s ratings with fake profiles and fake reviews), I, as someone who hated this movie, have nothing against Christians or Christianity. Not at all. Most everyone I know and love _are_ Christians. Die-hard, conservative, dyed-in-the-wool Fox-news-loving fundamentalist Christians. And even THEY thought this movie sucked.That Kirk tried to use religious guilt on people to have the ratings artificially inflated is just pathetic. Seriously, dude, you have a problem. You need help. Get some. :-/ My opinion of this movie is pretty much the same as the opinions of EVERYONE I know who&#x27;s actually had the misfortune of deciding to give it a try. It would be pure camp if those who made it weren&#x27;t being so stone-faced serious. It&#x27;s patronizing, condescending, childish and just downright _bad_. And it&#x27;s not the message, itself - even those I know who agree with the central point Kirk&#x27;s trying to make see the movie as doing more harm than good.As for that illicit ratings-inflating campaign, it appears to be bearing fruit. When you have a movie with overwhelmingly bad ratings (and I man REALLY bad, where most are just 1-star with, shall we say, &#x22;Nothing nice to say...&#x22;), and just a couple of profiles with 10-star ratings and glowing things to say, and ALL of those 10-star profiles were clearly just set up just to make the glowing review about just that one movie... I&#x27;m not going to outright accuse anyone of anything, but, well, it doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence in their legitimacy.I mean seriously, dude, stop it. You&#x27;re not helping Christianity&#x27;s image at all. In fact, you&#x27;re making it worse. Even if you don&#x27;t care about your own image, you should seriously give thought to how much more damage you want to do to the Christian image in the U.S. today. Or are you a closet atheist trying to destroy the &#x22;enemy&#x22; from within? Your actions are hurting far more than helping.And I have nothing against Christianity or religion in general. If people want to be proud of their religion and remind themselves of the spin Christianity has added to the meaning of all these previously-existing traditions and holidays, that&#x27;s wonderful. But this? This isn&#x27;t _that_. This is just pandering, patronizing, exploiting - pure and simple.Please, Kirk, get help.	1
How to Watch Saving Christmas	New York City	Every so often, a movie comes along that reminds us why drinking games were invented. This is that movie.Three margaritas seems to be the minimum for watching this one. With that much tequila in you, you will be able to appreciate the subtle humor and profound wisdom of Kirk Camer...hmph....hmph....hmph....BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!!!!!! Sorry. I thought I could type that with a straight face. I couldn&#x27;t. Must be the margaritas.At any rate, this is a laughably bad movie that should go a long way toward torpedoing Mr. Cameron&#x27;s already sinking career. And I say, fire at will!	1
Not feature-length quality	United States	Full disclosure: I am a Roman Catholic, raised by devout parents and taught by dedicated clergy. I happen to subscribe to the view that the &#x22;war on Christmas&#x22; is part of a larger, not necessarily connected, movement whose chief side effect is to eliminate or diminish the chief underpinnings and foundations of western Judeo-Christian society. Lawsuits against Nativity displays are, to me, the handiwork of unhappy zealots. Having said all that, this film was earnest but profoundly flawed.First, I didn&#x27;t appreciate the swipe against the Catholic Church&#x27;s hierarchy (bishops with high hats and scepters) during the St. Nicholas segment. I do like the St. Nicholas story, but it was contrived here with the original St. Nicholas doing a &#x22;ho-ho-ho&#x22; (I am not kidding) just before being told by his assistant to start the deliveries (presumably of gifts).Second, if indeed the simplicity of the original Nativity is to be stressed, with Jesus born to Mary and Joseph in a cave, laid in a feeding manger, then perhaps they should have cast a Mary who had not just had her nails done. There they were, as Mary was holding the Christ child, each nail impeccable - and painted. And their garments? Perfectly clean, even looking like they&#x27;d just been ironed. Third, don&#x27;t direct so that we can see the direction. Head turns, puzzled looks, earnest looks . . . I shouldn&#x27;t be hearing in my head the director&#x27;s exact stage directions. &#x22;OK, look right at him then turn away.&#x22; Fourth, this was not about Saving Christmas. This was about explaining our modern celebration of it - it&#x27;s already been saved, judging from the frequent references to it being celebrated the world over. I liked Noah. I liked Narnia. I like the Hobbit movies. I did not like this one.	1
More Plot in this review than in the movie	United States	Kirk plays Kirk. Bridgette plays Bridgette. That is about how inventive this movie is. Darren plays Christian, because the audience isn&#x27;t expected to understand that he is a typical Christian without this clue. Given that, Kirk should have been named CluelessLecturer.I didn&#x27;t stay long enough to see if the Titanic sunk, or if there was a surprise ending.As I watched this movie I realized that I would likely never again have to modify my &#x22;worst movie ever made&#x22; and for that, I thank you Kirk.GOOD POINTS: 1) no other movie through 2020 will have to worry about being Worst Movie of the Decade 2) we don&#x27;t make movies on &#x22;film&#x22; any more, so this is not a waste of film--- just a waste of digital 1s and 0s 3) i had more time to concentrate on my popcorn 4) i used my phone in the theater during the movie, and nobody seemed to think it was a bad thingKirk, it rained in California this week---- I think God saw your movie and was crying.	1
Did more to destroy Christmas than save it.	United States	&#x22;Jesus became Material... so that is why materialism is OK&#x22; - is pretty much the summary of the movie. There are some Christians who do not participate in Christmas for many reasons. Kirk apparently wanted to respond to this crowd by producing this low budget, effortless film. Not only does he do his best to destroy any solid logic for celebrating Christmas, he paints fellow (non Christmas observing) believers as grumpy, ignorant, radical, and stupid. Thus, giving mainstream Christianity a horrible image. Essential Kirk has brought Christian evangelism 2 steps back in reaching the world with the true message of salvation and replaced it with justification, poor logic, and and a refocus of the faith, not of Christ, but on emotion.Kirk attempted to encourage Christians with logic and reasoning to defend the mainstream stance of Christmas.... he failed. I left this film wanting more to NOT celebrate Christmas than I did celebrate it. Horrible film, waste of money, and waste of time. An E for Effort would not even be suitable to merit this film... No effort was placed in it.	1
Spoiler Alert...  It was awful!	United States	OK, So, after seeing this film, I don&#x27;t care what Kirk Cameron thinks about anything, and I surely never want to see (much less pay to see) anymore of his attempts at &#x22;Religious Entertainment&#x22;. They say that &#x22;no one starts out to make a bad film&#x22;. I think Kirk is the exception. I thought that this MIGHT be a &#x22;feel good&#x22; Christian film, it wasn&#x27;t. It was a lot of Cameron, not really even acting, just going on and on about how no one thought enough about Christ at Christmas. The fact that he distorted history about Christmas was also something that really added to the &#x22;holier than thou&#x22; factor of this film. And the fact that he totally ignores any other faith, that celebrate similar winter holidays adds to the arrogance of this film. It basically says, &#x22;If you don&#x27;t do everything that I do, you&#x27;re going to Hell.&#x22; Okay... Here&#x27;s the thing, Kirk Cameron can be a film maker. He can be an Actor. He can be a Preacher. But this film proves that he shouldn&#x27;t think that he can combine all three! He just comes across as pompous.	1
Must Not See	United States	This is the worst holiday movie ever made. Don&#x27;t go see this movie, don&#x27;t buy it. forget it happened, i try so hard every day to forget i wasted my life watching this. instead of viewing this movie, turn of your TV and spend time with your family. Get to know them better instead of watching 2 guys talk in a car for 20 minuets. just dot go,just dot go. just dot go ,just dot go . just dot go ,just dot go. why would anyone want to sit and watch this. go watch Rosewater way better film.what every you do don&#x27;t go and see this crappy film. you will hate it i hated it. Had &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; run any longer, i wold of died.	1
Another terrible movie from Kirk Cameron	None	This movie was a joke. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. It&#x27;s a typical pandering movie that will no doubt be forgotten. Cameron claims that Christmas has become too materialistic, yet in a recent article claimed he was a &#x27;sucker&#x27; for all things Christmas. The decorations, the gifts, the trees (which are Pagan by the way), and the shopping. He stated in an article he was a sucker for these things. Pretty much in contrary to his movie. He even once claimed Halloween was stolen by the Pagans from Christians. Kirk Cameron is quite clueless. Even Christmas is Pagan. He&#x27;s a joke and so are his movies. His movies are made just to line his pockets. He And he&#x27;s a bigot to boot.	1
Jesus Clearly Hates Kirk Cameron	United States	In this movie, Kirk Cameron shows us that the best way to get get the world to hate you is to judge and hate people who are different from you. Like Kirk Cameron, the key is to make sure you let everyone know that your judgmental and hateful behavior comes from Jesus and the Bible. Kirk doesn&#x27;t judge and hate because that&#x27;s who he is as a person. No. That is not why. Kirk judges and hates other people because the Bible and Jesus told him that he could behave that way. Where has the old Kirk Cameron of old gone? We all want to know. What made you so cray cray? Why are you so angry at the gays? Why do you hate other religions so much? Why did you ruin your sister, Candace, with your terrible ideas and nutso religious rantings? Oh, dearest Kirk, Bless Your Heart.	1
Worst movie ever. Directed by a disgusting human.	None	The loser Kirk Cameron actually tried to falsify the rating for this movie here and on Rotten Tomatoes.Someone should tell him that lying and cheating are not acceptable Christian values.Someone should also tell him that he&#x27;s celebrating a Pagan holiday. These things he decided are what makes Christmas what it is are the commercialized things that don&#x27;t actually have anything to do with Christmas. It&#x27;s like the guy owns stock in Christmas supplies. If you claim you like this movie, you are a liar. Since lying is a Christian no-no, you&#x27;re going to Hell. Enjoy.Not everyone should be allowed to make movies, especially when they have a political or religious agenda.God likes an honest Atheist more than a lying Christian.	1
Kirk Cameron doesnt speak for all of us	United States	I barely survived the trailer. I have no idea how people paid money to see this movie. As a Christian, I have to beg Christian filmmakers to stop preaching to the converted by writing atheists and agnostics as idiotic, hateful, anti-Christian monsters. Your persecution complex in a country comprised almost entirely of Christians is laughable and only further isolates you from those you hope to convert.Kirk Cameron could have made a movie that&#x27;s actually about family and the true meaning of Christmas. Instead, he wanted to create a polemic against the people he&#x27;s imagined that are trying to prevent him from calling it Christmas. It&#x27;s just sad. Please stop making these terrible films. You&#x27;re embarrassing all of us.	1
Wow	United States	After watching this movie, I may have to gouge my eyeballs out of my head in an attempt to erase the inane images seared into my retinas. Alas, it won&#x27;t help. Why can&#x27;t I give this a zero score? A score of 1 is infinitely higher than zero, and it frankly doesn&#x27;t deserve a 1. A more redeeming film could have been made simply by filming a humpback whale attempting to mate with a Russian submarine, or perhaps watching howler monkeys preen and consume the gnats out of each other&#x27;s hairy backs. But no . . . I was instead subjected to this sermon pontificating about how society has distorted the true meaning of Christmas (well, duh!) but yet after watching this, I found the thought of selfish consumerism to be rather uplifting. Now that is a Christmas miracle!	1
Cameron isnt so much saving Christmas as hes saving the economy for his pay masters	Seattle, WA	Ultimately if Christmas returned to its more simple religious roots (&#x22;reason for the season&#x22;), the vast economic pump that enriches, oh, Koch Industries and everyone else who keeps the religious right in power would be gone and they would, gasp, lose vast sums of money. Even if Christmas became more of an Easter level of commercialism, the effects on the economy would be ruinous. One wonders why Cameron has made such a film when most Christians scream about the commercialism (which technically is keeping most of them in jobs). I suppose Cameron isn&#x27;t so much saving Christmas as he&#x27;s saving the economy for his pay masters.	1
Abhorrent in every way	Silver Spring, Maryland	Every Christmas season one can count on the fact that we will be inundated with TV shows recycling the It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life story, Hallmark Channel will overwhelm us with treacle, and a spate of Christmas-themed films will multiply at the cineplex to raise holiday spirits. I give extremist Christian Kirk Cameron dubious credit for crafting a Christmas-themed film that actually seems to be completely clueless about the meaning of Christmas.It goes without saying that the film resembles a glorified home movie, with horrible writing, worse acting and horrendous production values. Most of the film functions as little more than an unwieldy frame for Cameron to lecture at the audience using the most spurious of &#x22;facts&#x22; and a dubious re-writing of history.The basic &#x22;story&#x22; opens at a family Christmas party where Kirk&#x27;s brother-in-law, Christian (oh the irony!) is all rather overwhelmed and depressed by the materialism of the holiday and feels that the true meaning of Christmas has been lost. This &#x22;attitude&#x22; apparently irritates everyone else, and so Kirk follows Christian to his car to harangue him on his misguided foolishness for the extraordinarily padded 80 minutes running time. Most of this has the camera focused on Cameron&#x27;s perpetually smug smirk while he relentlessly lectures his hapless brother-in-law with outright lies, heavily abridged stories, and general all-around shaming. Interspersed to pad the running time, we take some brief breaks back into the house where completely ridiculous one-note flamboyant caricatures indulge in laughable conversations that no one you know not in a padded cell will ever have with you in your lifetime. The pathetic point though is that during Cameron&#x27;s often incoherent and misleading ramblings, he never once truly addresses any of the issues that Christian had about the materialism of the modern celebrations. Nevertheless, Kirk&#x27;s relentless verbal diarrhea utterly astounds Christian and makes him &#x22;see the light&#x22; and he returns to the party to beg the forgiveness of everyone there for negatively impacting their celebration.Then, Kirk launches into yet another lecture where he urges us to buy the biggest tree, get the richest butter, and max out the credit cards because this is all a part of Christmas and don&#x27;t let anyone tell you otherwise. I myself was raised a Christian and I can assure you that if anyone were to parrot this thought back to any of my religion teachers, their mouth would be washed out with soap. It is a perfectly despicable moral and abysmal coda to an already dreadful &#x22;holiday&#x22; film, which does the unthinkable of surpassing Christmas with the Kranks and Jingle All the Way as the most morally jaded holiday film in history. The film also includes a relentless unfunny blooper reel AND a dance sequence that must be seen to be believed...or better yet don&#x27;t see it at all.	1
Absolutely deserving of the worst rating on this website	United States	I never in my life thought a movie would be deserving of a rating a full point lower than &#x22;Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.&#x22; Call it a Christmas miracle.There are movies that are boring, there are movies that are factually incorrect, and there are movies that exist solely to pander to a specific audience. This movie is deserving of recognition for, incredibly, setting records in all of these categories. Only an amazingly uneducated person who has expended a large amount of effort sticking their head in the sand for a large portion of their existence could possibly rate this movie in the 2-4 range. Anyone above that is simply bearing false witness (against the Bible&#x27;s commands, by the way) at the request of Cameron himself.	1
This Is Too Bad To Be Funny	United States	Anyone who has seen any of Kirk Cameron&#x27;s previous pseudo-films, which generally consist of a sort of Christian apologetic aimed at the grammar school crowd, may think that they know what to expect with this latest offering, and they would be right. Here is Kirk with his usual mugging and winks to the camera as he leads his audience through a tangled and woefully inaccurate lecture on the mythical &#x22;War on Christmas&#x22;. It is just plain awful. I forced myself to watch until the end and it wasn&#x27;t worth it. It is a really pathetic attempt by a pathetic little man to grab a little cash riding on the coattails of Bill O&#x27;Reilly and Fox News. I was hoping at least it would be stupid enough to be funny, but it was just pedantic, dull and annoying. Miss this one and see a real movie.	1
Awful X1000	United States	I never thought a movie could be as bad as Battlefield Earth, until this was released.The movie starts of literally with no plot and from there it is just Kirk and his &#x22;brother&#x22; Christian talking in a car. Kirk, you have not saved Christmas, you have ruined it just like you did film. What you tried to do is make everyone follow what you think Christmas is all about. Literally, this man cherry picks the Bible and creates his own version of the story. You know it amazes me how Kirk finds a&#x22;good way&#x22; to say &#x22;materialism is right&#x22;. How does he go from making such a great movie like &#x22;Fireproof&#x22; to this???? I am sorry as a Christian, but it was just so bad. Again, Please if you know what&#x27;s good for you, don&#x27;t watch this movie, it is that bad.	1
A complete waste of time	London	I love a really strong, beautiful or funny film that lets me, as a Christian, not be embarrassed about my faith. Saving Christmas had me wanting to climb into a hole. From beginning to end, it plays like one of those late night infomercials where the host is far to excited to be human. This film is nothing but a vanity vehicle for Kirk Cameron, it&#x27;s self congratulatory and he comes off like a 12 year old locked in a toy store over night. His performance is a wreck, his exaggerated enthusiasm is cringe-worthy and at any minute you expect him to giggle and shout &#x22;Hey Ma! I&#x27;m making my own movie.&#x22; This is less a movie about Christmas, Jesus, or anything else as much as it is about Kirk Cameron begging you to look at him as he twirls.	1
Worse than Ebola, Aids, The Black Plague, 9/11 and Bucky Larson combined.	North Pole	Prior to viewing this film I was a devout Christian and Pastor. However this film broke my spirit and has caused me to not only reject my faith in God but in humanity all together.Each scene is worse than the last as Kirk Cameron uses the first portion of the film gathering wood, nails and a microphone to construct what will be int he second half, The worlds largest soap box.As a former pastor I once sat for a 5 hour sermon and still think this film is more preaching than that.When the film ended two thoughts crossed my mind, One was the strangely absent &#x27;That&#x27;s All Folks&#x22; Looney Toones ending and the second was a written apology and or refund of my money.Don&#x27;t watch this film, ever, don&#x27;t subject your family, friends or even stray animals to this picture.Kirk may be trying to silence the critics but the reality is this movie is so horrid so void of content and character that it may induce suicide in the depressed.In summation a 0 ratings needs to exist on IMDb because giving this long winded rambling non non sequitur a 1 is giving it too many stars.	1
Merry Kirkmas	None	Kirk, you set new standards for just how low the bar can be. I don&#x27;t know what genre this movie would fit int but it somehow is humorous and terrifying at the same time. I&#x27;m not sure if it was satire or you really believe in your own bu11sh*t. The message of this movie was so forced and there were more logical fallacies than I could juggle with. I almost recommend others to watch it because the entirety of FAIL this film contains is too much to believe. The record score of 1.5 stars should tell you something, Mr. Cameron. All hope isn&#x27;t lost though, you may make a 1 star film that would make this one look better. Having less arbitrary music, better acting, and improved cinematography over all might be a good start.	1
Kirk Cameron - Hero in the 80s, Pathetic at Best Now	USA	This movie should have never been made, it&#x27;s a farce at best and an insult to the viewer&#x27;s intelligence at best. I used to admire Kirk Cameron when I was growing up in the 1980s, he was a cute star then. It is so sad to see that he is now a fanatical, bible thumping, proselytizing has-been. I&#x27;m sure if you are also a fanatical extremist Christian, this movie will surely appeal to you, and you can share in Cameron&#x27;s sad, lonely little world of fanaticism. However, if you are a non-extremist Christian, or anyone else in the world, you will find this movie to be offensive in at least one or more ways.This movie surely belongs at the bottom of the bottom 100 list. Mr. Cameron, please retire.	1
Everything that needs to be said about this movie has already been said.	United States	When a movie makes the bottom of the IMDb worst movie list, I have to see it in the theater if at all possible. For weeks now, I read the bad reviews, read Cameron&#x27;s plea for fans to up his ratings online, and anticipated this getting cam&#x27;d so I wouldn&#x27;t have to pay good money to see it. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not even good enough for someone to cam and upload online.The problem is that this movie never should have been released in theaters; it should have been straight to video. More accurately, it never should have been released at all. All this film equates to is a big stroke of Cameron&#x27;s ego. He is clearly in love with himself, and I&#x27;m sure every review, good or bad, makes him feel all the more confident. It&#x27;s sad, but true. Or, maybe he was just trying to do something nice for his family. If you have the money, why not make a movie with your sister so she can feel like a star too. Unfortunately, she probably feels more shame than good.There is no doubt here. This is a bad movie. Yes, I might even say it&#x27;s the worst movie ever. I&#x27;ve never walked out on a movie before, and that record still holds. However, the thought passed my mind several times while watching. I now feel ashamed of myself that I did not. The bastardization of Christianity that this movie inflicts upon the viewer is almost unbearable. I&#x27;m sad to know that I supported Mr. Cameron by paying to see this film. However, I am happy to see this filth voted into oblivion.	1
How wretchedly horrible and insulting	Broken Arrow, Oklahoma	This has to be one of the most insulting and wretched movies of all time. It doesn&#x27;t even look like anyone bothered to edit it competently, much less write a decent script.Don&#x27;t bother with this unless you need to educate yourself on the latest crap out of Kirk Cameron&#x27;s pie hole.Just total garbage. I&#x27;d personally like to know what exactly happened to this kid back in the 90s to cause this mess.Please. If you see this film then give it a review here. People need to be warned fairly about the disgusting nature of it as well as the incompetent work done in it.	1
You have to see this to believe it, I mean it!	Maryland, United States	I&#x27;m kinda in charge of my church&#x27;s youth group. It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m the only guy in their 20s that shows up for church. I don&#x27;t know how we ended up seeing this movie because none of us wanted to see this. The teens didn&#x27;t want to see some religious movie, my pastor didn&#x27;t want to see this because she loathes Kirk Cameron, and I didn&#x27;t want to see it because I wanted to see a good movie. Apparently one of the parents insisted we see a documentary about making Christmas more about Jesus and less about commercialism.Well the jokes on them because shockingly this movie is all about justifying the commercialism of Christmas.I was seriously not expecting that. THis movie throws so much BS at you that it&#x27;s pretty worrying. It&#x27;s also really funny. I think I was the only person who enjoyed this movie. I was hoping that Kirk would have a seeing where he&#x27;s just says insane things like his infamous interview on evolution.This whole movie is insane. I don&#x27;t think anyone was expecting it to be like this with the random dance scenes, the stereotyped black guy, the stereotypical atheist, and everything else.And now here is an example of Cameron&#x27;s crazy points about Christmas: -The Christmas tree is not Pagen, it is because Adam and Eve stole from the tree of knowledge and to make up for the original sin, Jesus returned the fruit which was part of man by hanging himself on a cross, which is made of wood which naturally comes from a tree. So trees are really crosses and the Christmas tree is a cross.I did not make that up, that is seriously an argument he makes.And the whole movie is so insane that you have to see it to believe it. I don&#x27;t think this movie will harm society because I think most Christians who make a big deal about the &#x22;War on Christmas&#x22; will be horrified by this and those who actually buy into it were probably lost causes. But if you want to see a man who clearly needs to be institutionalized just be gloriously and honestly insane, then watch this movie. I haven&#x27;t seen anything this funny since Twilight Breaking Dawn Part II.	1
Transparent drivel	Norway	This is nothing more than a poorly hidden attempt of Cameron to do some preaching and to his fellow Christians by the looks if it. And he does so with the total lack of historical and factual knowledge he is so well known for. This disaster is a mess from the sound, cam job to the post editing if any was done at all. I won&#x27;t even mention the acting because there was none. The logic behind his argument was best illustrated by Penny Walker; Arizona Republic! &#x22;How do you prove a horse is an animal? Because I like Sweden. That&#x27;s the style of absurd logic that happens in &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas&#x22;.I turned the damn thing off half way. I simply couldn&#x27;t stomach any more of his ramblings. Given Cameron&#x27;s track record, I knew it was going to be bad, but thus he reached a new low on his decent in to obscurity. I spent some time thinking of something positive to say about this laughable dung pile, and I came up with one thing. It didn&#x27;t have Ray Comfort in it.	1
Excreatable crap and false propaganda.	New Zealand	Kirk Cameron tries to &#x27;revise&#x27; history to make Christmas have always been about Christianity. Sadly any forth grader with access to a library, or even just Google, can discover this isn&#x27;t true.Cameron uses terrible acting and transparently obvious preachy propaganda to make what surely must be the most banal Christian movie ever.I&#x27;d rather have my internal organs liquefied by flesh eating viruses, than have to watch another second of this crap.It it was JUST boring as hell, or JUST transparent propaganda, or JUST full of &#x27;lies that are OK to tell because it&#x27;s in service of my religion&#x27;, then would be a bad, yet forgettable religious infomercial... I mean movie. But it&#x27;s all that and worse, so I&#x27;m left wishing there was a way to edit out my memory of this abysmal turd of a movie.Ugggh.	1
Cautionary Tale	Los Angeles	Aside from the fact that Mr. Cameron is the dean of the Tool Academy; this is so unwatchable that if Kubric was alive, he would replace all the ultra-violent movies in A Clockwork Orange with this turd and he wouldn&#x27;t even have to induce a gag reflex . . . that much is conveniently built-in. Plot? Acting? This disaster leaves so much to be desired that he should pray for forgiveness for the rest of his days. I do not think Jesus himself would be able to forgive this offensive attempt at art. Is it not enough to embarrass yourself on CNN and YouTube with the bible thumping? He has the temerity to ask people to spend their hard earned money, and precious time enduring this drivel. The rock is ready for you when you&#x27;re ready to crawl back under it.	1
Should have been called Murdering Christmas	Massachusetts	Forget the laughably shoddy production value, the overt preaching, and Kirk Cameron&#x27;s epic social media temper tantrum when the film was critically panned. All you need to know is that Cameron&#x27;s message about Christmas is the opposite of what one would expect from a movie called &#x22;Saving Christmas.&#x22;See, that whole &#x22;saving Christmas&#x22; storyline has been played out in kids&#x27; movies and Hallmark specials over and over again, and it&#x27;s always about stripping away the commercialism and materialism and getting back into friends and family.Kirk does the exact opposite in this film: He CELEBRATES and ENCOURAGES rabid commercialism. And worst of all, he even attempts to justify his materialism -- his greed and narcissism -- by claiming that&#x27;s the good proper Christian thing to do.So if not from rabid consumerism, what is Kirk Cameron trying to save Christmas from? From people celebrating, or even acknowledging the existence of, other holidays besides Christmas, from non-Christians celebrating Christmas, and from Christians celebrating Christmas any other way than the way Kirk Cameron believes you should.In short, this is eighty minutes of Kirk Cameron trying to cram one hundred pounds of his self-absorbed discount-salvation bull**** into a one-pound bag, slap &#x22;Christmas Spirit&#x22; on it with a label maker, and hopelessly attempt to cram it down your throat.Unless you are a raving fascist fundamentalist who only hasn&#x27;t watched this movie because you are afraid of what will happen if you turn your 24/7 Fox News feed off, this movie is guaranteed to make you very angry. It does to Christmas the exact opposite of what the title promises: It delivers unto Christ this biggest black eye in our lifetime.	1
Ho Ho No!	United States	I have never been religious. In fact, the only times I ever step in a church are for weddings and while on vacation in Europe. So, I did not go into Saving Christmas with much of an open mind. But I gave it a chance. A small chance. It was about the time when St. Nick commits murder that I turned it off. Just stay away from this movie. The acting is bad. The only people who might like this movie are death row prisoners on their day of execution, because Saving Christmas makes an hour feel like an eternity. Like I said, I am not the kind of person this movie was made for. But I&#x27;m certain that even if I believed in Jesus and what-not, I would still find this movie awful. Kirk Cameron should be ashamed and embarrassed, but he is not, which makes him guilty of the sin of pride.	1
The Non-War on Christmas	United States	By now, everyone has become familiar with Kirk Cameron&#x27;s delusional and self indulgent attitudes about evangelical Christianity. Most probably also realize that his ideas and opinions are simply wrong. This movie is simply one of his more self indulgent tirades about the supposed removal of Christian themes at Christmas time and how we are all going to Hell. Or something similar. His complete lack of accuracy concerning the actual beginnings of the Christmas holiday not only make the movie a laughable joke, but also showcase his ignorance, therefore ALL Christian&#x27;s ignorance (He seems to like taking credit for speaking for all Christians) A 10 minute search on the internet will inform even the most staunch Catholic that EVERY aspect of Christmas including the iconic Christmas tree, gift-giving, yule logs, etc, were all adapted by early Christian leaders from PAGAN sources! Here&#x27;s another quick fact; Jesus wasn&#x27;t born in December! He was probably born sometime during the Summer months. He is also apparently unaware that when the Puritans settled in America, they OUTLAWED all Christmas celebrations for almost 80 years! We are also treated to more whining about the removal of manger displays, etc from public areas. Yet not a single display on a truly PUBLIC area has been forced to be be removed by public outcry (at least none that I have heard about) Instead, most manger displays that have been removed were on State or Federal property! And yes, THIS IS a violation of the &#x22;Separation of Church &#x26; State&#x22; laws. All in all, the movie is a complete mess! Loaded with self indulgent garbage, this waste of film is also horribly written and directed with acting so far below par as to make a grade school play seems like Shakespeare in the Round. Kirk needs to keep audiences amused with his fire breathing dragons and keep his nose out of major film-making.	1
To call this movies clich is an insult to the word clich.	Houston TX	You know I am not a religious man, yet I like most Christmas and even religious movies but this is the worst out of the horrifically bad 2014 lot. God&#x27;s not dead, Noah, Its a matter of faith no gems in the bunch. No Ben-Hur but this out does them all in how bad it is. Two thirds plus of this movie is not only not uplifting (as I feel a Christmas should be) but it is downright depressing. It is a lot of talk about how this guy is so sad that Christmas is not hyper religious, &#x22;Christian&#x22; the man in the film did something I thought impossible. He made Christmas sad, he made my favorite day of the year a sad pathetic pity party in which only your own wishes matter. Here is to a better 2015 for Christians, and I say that as an atheist, because damn this year was harsh.	1
Didnt even get through the trailer	Kansas City	I didn&#x27;t even get through the trailer... it was so bad that I had to stop halfway through because the lies were already too much. Any sensible person would not watch this movie. The only way this could be comedy is if you think that their ridiculous claims about the origins of Christmas are made in jest... but we all know they are not. Also I was confused. Sounds like the brother was under the impression that Jesus was the &#x22;reason for the season&#x22; anyway and actually just hates the rest of us who don&#x27;t believe that. So why does Kirk go on to explain why everything we associate with Christmas is in the Bible. It&#x27;s like a scientist trying to convince another scientist of gravity when the other scientist already believes in gravity.	1
Yikes!	Boston	Truly the worst serious release of 2014. It fails on so many levels. 1st there is acting, it was comparable to a late night infomercial where you have the straw man doubting things then Kirk explains and boom Kirk&#x27;s explanations was so enlightening that he goes &#x22;I never thought of it that way&#x22; I&#x27;m surprised there wasn&#x27;t a &#x22;wait, we will double the order&#x22; flashing on the screen. Now writing, this has to be a small Christmas miracle in itself, he managed to offend atheist and Christians at the same time. Embrace the commercialism and because Jesus was god made flesh would should indulge the flesh and buy, buy, buy. &#x22;Picture the wrapped gifts as the New Jerusalem&#x22; and point taken from some far fetched sermon about the most important part of Christmas is the swaddling cloth. I wish I was joking but you just can&#x27;t make this stuff up. Last there is the directing choices, hey let&#x27;s shoot the most of it with 2 guys sitting in a car. The movie was lacking material and really feels like it was dragged out. And the pi&#xE8;ce de r&#xE9;sistance is the musical Christmas wrap number.	1
Ho Ho Horrible!	United States	How does a co-star on an 80s sitcom get to be such a loud mouth in the fundamentalist Christian movement? Audacity, I guess. Kirk, there is no war on Christmas -- only people making money off of other people&#x27;s persecution complexes and desire to play the victim. This film is good for a few laughs, until you realize some people actually take this stuff seriously. Looks like it was made by a high school audio video club and it consists of nothing but Fox News type statements about the demonic forces of secularism trying to destroy Christmas (which must be a surprise to those who continue to receive Christmas presents each year and the billions of adds on TV for Christmas bargains). Christians should be more concerned about starving children than whether someone says Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas.	1
Cheap, Condescending Exploitation Masquerading As Family-Friendly Fare	United States	If TV&#x27;s Mike Seaver was truly out to &#x22;put the Christ back in Christmas&#x22;, he would have known better than to go with pathetically dissect-able straw-man arguments and revisionist non-history. If he sincerely felt the need to contribute a faith-positive cinematic effort this holiday season, he could have made a modest effort not to insult the intelligence of his purported ideological peers to such a gross extent. Instead, Kirk Cameron makes a movie that claims to refute secular interpretations of winter solstice celebrations, but instead seems to hold severe contempt for its own target audience.Clearly, Kirk saw the surprising profits enjoyed by the recent wave of low-budget Christian-themed films like &#x22;God&#x27;s Not Dead&#x22; and &#x22;Heaven Is For Real&#x22;, and decided he wanted to get in on the action. Cameron&#x27;s vested interest in this project became clear when he took to Facebook imploring his followers to inflate the poor ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. However, had he might have done better to put half as much energy into a competent production and perhaps a marginal amount of historical research. For that matter,Cameron could use a refresher on his own holy book (how about starting with Hebrews 13:5, 1 Timothy 6:10, Matthew 6:24, Acts 8:20, Isaiah 46:6?) Perhaps he should also review the 9th Commandment.Spoiler alert: Kirk Cameron spends 75 minutes spouting historical inaccuracies to a supporting cast sporting forced smiles, and about 5 minutes setting up unfunny slapstick sequences and obsequious dance segments, both of which are solely for the purpose of padding out the trailer to give impressionable moviegoers the idea that &#x22;Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas&#x22; is &#x22;light-hearted&#x22; and &#x22;feel-good&#x22;.	1
Dont let your children watch this movie	Sweden	I can not in words convey how awful this movie is. It doesn&#x27;t work as a movie as it is not fun or entertaining in any way. It doesn&#x27;t work as a documentary as it present extremely bizarre ideas as facts.I would put a advisory GP-13 warning on this one. Parents should be strongly cautioned against letting their children watch this. The material may very well be hurtful and inappropriate for children under 13-years.Apparently this movie managed to gross $2.5 million at the box office in a two week run - that is a depressingly high figure and sad testament to the society of today.	5
Serious Piece of Crap	United States	Why? Why? WHY???? This is about 70 minutes of nothing but Kurt Cameron telling everyone how they&#x27;re doing Christmas wrong. I&#x27;ve got news for you, Kurt. Christmas is about celebrating Jesus, and everyone celebrates in a different way. Not only that, but when did you stop even trying to act??? Please... go back to sitcoms, become a preacher, become a writer - just don&#x27;t do ALL of those things, because multi- tasking is not your forte. There are some really good reviews of this movie on here, and that just reminds me of why some people just shouldn&#x27;t be allowed near a keyboard - ignorance, brainwashing, and just plain dumb. Don&#x27;t waste your time with this film. If you want a nice, wholesome - HONEST movie for the holidays, rent the 10 Commandments or Ben Hur.	1
horrible, just horrible even Jesus cries in shame at this	None	this movie is by far worse than anything I have ever imagined. Kirk turns this into an hour long lecture sprinkled with bits and pieces of bible stories. I&#x27;ve been to funerals with more plot than this steaming pile of crap. We get to see two guys talk about nothing for an hour and we get to pay for it! Nice job Kirk. This movie is a sermon, a bad one, that is nothing less than a rant about trying to redeem the holiday, which has never been Christian to begin with. I wish mr cameron would either read his bible (and see that christians are forbidden to decorate &#x27;trees from the field&#x27;) or at least recognize that his cult, er religion, has done nothing but steal other cultures ideas and make them their own. Nice guys. Save your money, if you want to &#x27;save&#x27; Christmas, don&#x27;t see this.	1
Worst. Movie. Ever.	United States	Honestly I didn&#x27;t watch it. I was going to then I seen a video of Kirk Cameron and some dude talking about how Evolution is fake because a banana fits in a hand. This made me realize I was into dudes because a dudes banana fits in my hand. Now I&#x27;m gay because if Kirk Cameron. Thanks Kirk.I guess I should watch it. But honestly Kirk seems like a complete psycho path. I understand he&#x27;s one of those celebrities that cant find work so he found &#x22;God&#x22;. It&#x27;s just sad to see him taking advantage of people who believe in magic invisible sky monsters. SO watch it, don&#x27;t watch it. I wont contribute my valuable time to such a sicko. But you can do what you like!	1
Kirk Cameron Makes Me Want to Be an Athiest	United States	I consider myself a good Catholic boy. Kirk Cameron seems to not understand that the Protestant Christianity that he ascribes to was born out Catholicism, which in turn derives from Judaism. What caused the schism is that there were too many &#x22;unacceptable rules&#x22;, like clergy can&#x27;t get married, no divorce, etc(See Henry VIII) People like Cameron have no faith. Faith, by definition, is belief without certainty or knowledge. Evangelicals are certain there is a God, and even more certain that everything they say, do, and believe is exactly what God wants. The arrogance and total lack of personal humility in these people is astounding and disgraceful. I can&#x27;t imagine any God who isn&#x27;t disgusted by their hateful speech and behavior. That being said, sometimes I feel guilty(being a good Irish Catholic American boy), so I decided to see &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; with no judgment or presupposition in mind. To say the least, it was horrifying, and a giant pile of steaming Ode to Cameron&#x27;s immeasurable ego. Essentially like all of Kirk&#x27;s films, He(Cameron) is in-the-know, and everyone else who disagrees with him, Jew, Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, or any other non-evang. sect of Protestantism is going to hell. To my credit by the way, I saw it all the way through.BTW, if you read the very first reviews on IMDb, all 10 stars from his brainwashed, small-minded followers. Research the movie, Cameron actually encouraged his flock to try and boost the ratings on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. It backfired, which, to me, says that there are more good people who despise hypocritical judgment of others in the guise of religious fervor than not. That&#x27;s encouraging.	1
Mike Seaver is a Believer	United States	I used to like Kirk Cameron as Mike Seaver. Ya know, from Growing Pains? I thought this movie would be as funny as Growing Pains. Apparently Kirk Cameron is a Born Again Christian now? That doesn&#x27;t seem right. Him, Eddie and Boner were always up to no good on Growing Pains. And I don&#x27;t think an actual Christian would&#x27;ve made fun of Carol like that. Remember how Leo DiCaprio got his start on Growing Pains? I wonder if they still talk. Remember the episodes where his brother Ben is into that blonde girl? She went on to play Penny Belding, Mr. Belding&#x27;s daughter on Saved By the Bell. Anyway, I didn&#x27;t much care for this movie. Kirk Cameron&#x27;s character spent too much time talking about Jesus of Nazareth.	1
Just dont...please!	None	This excuse for a &#x22;movie&#x22; is nothing more than a Christian persecution complex disguised as a preachy family film. I couldn&#x27;t make it all the way through. I have no idea how so many Christians think that they&#x27;re under attack in a country that&#x27;s mostly Christian. If you think Christmas is too commercial, then celebrate it differently! I&#x27;m not going to act as though I&#x27;m not disgusted at people being trampled to death under crazed consumers turned to a herd of farm animals in order to score a deal on the new iWhatever go buy for a child too young to appreciate it, but guess what? You don&#x27;t have to participate. Also, why is Happy Holidays so offensive? News flash, this country is a melting pot and people from all over the world come here with different beliefs. I&#x27;m sure EVERYONE who knows you&#x27;re Christian will wish you a Merry Christmas, so why not be a little more cultured and inclusive so the rest of the world will stop laughing at us for a little while?	1
Not a Review	None	I&#x27;m going to be completely honest - I haven&#x27;t seen Saving Christmas. But judging from what others have said about the film, I think I did myself a favor by not seeing it. But I&#x27;m still going to review it, in a way. Not necessarily a review of the film, but more a review of just how well Kirk Cameron took the news about the reviews of his Christian film.In short, he didn&#x27;t take it well at all.When critics panned the movie, Cameron decided to take to Facebook and try to crusade, I guess, against the critics by telling his followers to give the movie a positive review at Rotten Tomatoes. It completely back-lashed and everyone negatively reviewed it instead. I think I read somewhere that there&#x27;s like 175 pages of negative reviews on RT. Hilarious.I don&#x27;t think I need to explain just how telling your fans to positively review your movie is stupid and how less people will like you for it, so I won&#x27;t. I&#x27;ll just assume you have a brain and move on.Negative reviews kept flowing in, and eventually, this became the lowest rated film on IMDb. Why do you think this is? Because the movie is awful? Because there are even some Christians that hate this movie? Well, if you asked Cameron, he&#x27;d say it&#x27;s because of atheists and &#x22;haters&#x22; (God, that&#x27;s a dumb word) campaigning against it. You know, despite the large amount of professional critics, whether Christian or not, giving the film a low rating.Kirk, you are f*cking cancerous. You&#x27;re a cancer upon the film industry and you&#x27;re a cancer upon Christianity.One day I might watch this movie and give a proper review, but until then, I hate it because Kirk Cameron can&#x27;t take any criticism over it.	1
Ummm...WTC?	None	I wanted to say WTF, but all I could think of was, &#x22;What the Christ?&#x22;Yeah, maybe a step over the top considering I&#x27;m an atheist. So yeah, of course I wouldn&#x27;t like this movie. To be honest, I only watched the trailer. Enough for me to give it one star. If there was an option to erase the movie from my memory and from the public domain completely, I would have taken that one.Christmas (really, the holidays in general), are not about Christ. This time of year is about giving and thanking. Yeah, we all say we love to give, but oh boy that new flat screen sure makes me a happy man. And the fact that people have to pull politics and religion into this time of year is disappointing.Anyway, this movie is not worth the time of the trailer. Heed my warning, and stop now! Just love one another (or so the saying goes), and enjoy this time of year! It&#x27;s cold and miserable, but somewhat magical. Just wear protection.	1
masterfully brilliant	None	If the world hate me, so shall it hate you.. these words of prophecy spoken by none other than Jesus Christ the Eternal Master Himself whose birthday is celebrated at this Most Glorious Time of year every year..Welcome be the critics placing true genius at the bottom rung of the proverbial totem pole, which comes as no surprise to those true geniuses and artists, for this is the design of the ages and is so meant. SOMEONE has to be bottom of the ladder. And First step. Why not a great work of Christian Family Cinematic genius as has been deemed by the critics. For which we are most and eternally grateful and thankful. Merry Christmas to you all. Christians, atheists and all critics and fans. MERRY Christmas TO ALL!	1
Cinematic equivalent of a car accident	Vegas baby	Wife and I visited the multiplex tonight and saw the excellent &#x22;Whiplash&#x22; and then decided to stay for &#x22;Citizenfour&#x22;. We needed to kill an hour between films, so we ducked into &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22;. She played solitaire on her phone for an hour. No one minded because we were the only two people in the theater. This film was the single most disturbing yet simultaneously hilarious experience I have ever had at the movies. The guy is obviously deeply in love with himself, and is so brainwashed that every time he looks directly into the camera with his vacant, smug, slightly cross-eyed stare, I was totally creeped out. He has about the same intellectual capacity for rational thought as my poodle. I actually think he may be a robot. He manages to say something that would offend every demographic group out there in a way not seen since Andrew Dice Clay, only he&#x27;s not trying to be funny (I think, not sure). Wife wanted to hang out in the restroom rather than sitting through any more cinematic defecation, but I couldn&#x27;t tear myself away. Had to leave before the much hyped dance sequence. As an atheist, I gave it a ten as a good will gesture. No hard feelings. Heaven help you, Kirk!	10
Kirk is a great guy, but this film just isnt very good	United States	As a Christian, I love Kirk Cameron, he is a truly great guy who is serving the Lord very well. Unfortunately, though his intentions were good for this film, and it might be what GOD wanted, but I really kind of think that this time he may have made a mistake. This is the kind of film that may work for Churches to show their members, but the quality isn&#x27;t very good, and it definitely doesn&#x27;t work as a public film. It usually angers me a lot when people give low ratings to Christian films (particularly the new &#x22;Left Behind&#x22;). But for this movie I really can&#x27;t blame people for giving it a low rating, I would too if I wasn&#x27;t a fan of his.	5
30 minutes of content, the balance was crap	Iowa	The introduction was slow. The five of us were in our queen-sized bed watching it on my laptop, and my 6-year-old passed out before the introduction was over. Not knowing about the movie prior, I would have thought this was how it was going to be throughout it, which made me a little nervous. I kept looking over at my 9-year-old to check if she was still paying attention. Thankfully she&#x27;s got a longer attention span than my 6-year-old.The movie starts with Kirk Cameron attending his sister&#x27;s huge Christmas party that she throws every year. The house is gorgeous&#x96; everything is decorated beautifully, there are a ton of people and lots of food. Kirk asks his sister where her husband is, and she explains he&#x27;s just not feeling Christmas this year. Kirk then goes out to the car where he finds his brother-in-law sulking and grouchy, complaining about how all of this STUFF isn&#x27;t what Christmas is really about! How it&#x27;s all Pagan!Kirk goes on to combat each one of his brother-in-law&#x27;s objections about the Christmas traditions; the Christmas tree, Santa, Christmas lights, and gifts. Each objection is given a story. My 9-year-old&#x27;s favorite was seeing Santa beat a guy up! You&#x27;ll have to watch the movie to find out why Santa beats this man up:)Overall, I enjoyed the content of the movie--not the fluff. Some parts were really corny, but I think that was Kirk&#x27;s intent. They poked fun at Pentecostal Christians. There were several scenes where I found myself saying, &#x22;I don&#x27;t understand how this fits?&#x22; or &#x22;I don&#x27;t feel this explains his intent very well.&#x22; Santa was spot-on, but a lot of the explanations seemed like a very high-level overview that left me feeling a lot like Concrete Blonde&#x27;s lyrics:These little conversations Well for me they&#x27;ll never do Now what am I supposed to do with Broken sentences of you? Like a book with missing pages Like a story incomplete Like a painting left unfinished It feels like not enough to eat.I would have loved to see more depth to the stories told. The movie is about 69 minutes long, 30 minutes of which had content&#x85; the rest was just, &#x22;fluff&#x22;. I&#x27;m not sure I would spend $10 at the theater for it. It&#x27;s more suited for a TV special.Towards the end of the movie, there is a hip hop dancing scene that made me really uncomfortable. From reading the credits, I understand this is some sort of faith-based hip hop dance crew, but I felt it wasn&#x27;t very appropriate for the movie. I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself a prude, either&#x85;it just felt odd.If you ignore those minor details, I think you&#x27;ll enjoy this movie, too! This was unlike some of Kirk Cameron&#x27;s movies that are more like a documentary&#x96;this was part story, part documentary...I think.I think what sealed the deal on the film was what Kirk said in summary,&#x22;We need to make traditions of our own. We need to infuse old symbols with new meaning. We need to arrange our lives and our homes so that every single thing points to Jesus. &#x22;Also,&#x22;Remind your children that every character in God&#x27;s story has a place.&#x22;	2
*GASP* It is not the worst movie ever!	None	Well, I finally went to see the movie. There were actually good crowd. Everyone is setting this out to be a horrible movie. While I admit it is not the best movie I have ever seen it is by far NOT the worst. It was entertaining. I even laughed a little (But not as much as the elderly couple beside me). There were some highlights and other spots that could have better potential. But it served its point. I left pondering the content. What is Christmas about? While it probably won&#x27;t put &#x27;Christ back in Christmas&#x27; world wide it can cause individuals to have a change of heart. Why shouldn&#x27;t everyone Christmas with a major dance party?	7
Who went to this movie expecting anything other than what was delivered	United States	Did you seriously go expecting something else. The movie delivered exactly what was advertised a frank discussion of the traditions of Christmas from a Christian view. I knew what I was going to see and I enjoyed it. For those who have not seen it, this is a discussion of something we as evangelical Christians have heard for many years. Does the celebration of Christmas and the inclusion of everything not Jesus make us less of a believer. Cameron puts forth the argument that not embracing our long held traditions is an attack on Christmas itself and why we should be OK with each one. Could it have been more cinematically engaging, yes, but I enjoyed the movie.	8
Live and let live!	NC	&#x22;Live and let live&#x22; comes to mind when I see all the 1-star reviews. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not so nosy that I&#x27;d go on the internet and give 1-star reviews to a movie that is not even in my categories of movies I&#x27;d ever watch. I don&#x27;t care about sports, but I don&#x27;t go around ripping on the fact that sports exists, nor do I personally attack other people for liking sports. I saw the movie just to see what it was about and to see what they did with it. I&#x27;ve never researched Christmas so I can neither confirm nor deny any of the arguments. I don&#x27;t know where the symbols came from. I choose to decorate by my own personal likes and dislikes and not other people&#x27;s opinions. What I walked away from the movie feeling was, &#x27;don&#x27;t let the haters embitter you and take the joy out of your own personal celebration.&#x27; Keep the joy in your Christmas celebration, whether you 100% with zero doubts fully understand every single aspect or not. For those of you who believe and celebrate Christmas, Have a joyous Christmas! For those of you who don&#x27;t believe and resent the existence of Christmas, why don&#x27;t you go look up something on a topic that you like rather than stress yourself out by enraging yourself to the point of wanting to attack other people. Live and let live.	7
It was fine.	None	More of a sterilized sermon than a movie. I thought the movie was paced a little slow but in the end the movie was enjoyable and had a since of humor. I&#x27;m sure it was polarizing for many and that many that have panned it never saw it. My wife and I both enjoyed the movie and it gave a great platform for extensive discussion. I especially enjoyed the refocus on the Christmas Tree. It gave me no new information but a little different perspective on the tree and its importance. The movie has no real plot but is rather one group&#x27;s (obviously Kirk didn&#x27;t make this film by himself) explanation for the significance and enjoyment of Christmas. I saw no real reason to involve the story of St. Nicholas with the Lord of the Rings, but it was more history of the church than most people ever get.	8
Very worth watching	Chesapeake, VA	Overall, I thought it was a great Christian movie. The message of celebrating Christmas instead of getting so wrapped up in the arguments over certain details of the celebration I think was lost on a lot of people, given how many people rated it low based on particular details of his description of the holiday. There were parts of it that I felt he was &#x22;reaching with&#x22; as well (particularly his explanation of the Christmas tree) but a lot of other thoughts that were very thought provoking to me (his take on the birth of). Besides, I personally love hearing other people&#x27;s opinions and beliefs. =)) To me, the worst parts of the movie were the &#x22;lecture style&#x22; intro and the dance scene in it...but again, the movie itself I thought was very thoughtful and thought provoking, and I personally LOVED the &#x22;Celebrate Christmas&#x22; message it contained. The script was well written and the acting surpassed most independent films (which people tend to forget it was).Basically, if you&#x27;re not the type of person to say &#x22;It&#x27;s Kirk Cameron, I&#x27;m going to hate it&#x22;, then it&#x27;s more than worth watching, if you are that type of person, then definitely don&#x27;t waste your time. It&#x27;s someone of strong faith using his artistic ability to spread his beliefs to anyone who wants to hear his message, and based on that fact I give it a 10. It&#x27;s not a message that&#x27;s popular in our culture, and especially not popular in secular Hollywood.	10
I condemn you to hell!	Ireland	Saving Christmas is a fabulous movie that we&#x27;ll all be watching for years to come. This movie celebrates Christmas in all it&#x27;s glory and tells us what it&#x27;s really about, Jesus Christ. &#x22;I condemn you to hell!!!&#x22;, I roared at the devil-worshipers who were shaking their heads after the film ended. This movie truly is &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; before all the anti-Christs finally fill our joyous hearts with Illuminati! I&#x27;m speaking to the last of us saviors; grab your cross, get your torches fired up, bring your pitchforks as we will reign our terror on all the no-good doers that walk on our planet! Jesus Christ shall ooze from all of your souls!!! WE CONDEMN YOU ALL TO HELL!!!!!!Thank you, 10/10.	10
Best movie ever!	Sweden	This movie is a masterpiece from the story to the acting is 10/10 I don&#x27;t think anything could have made this movie better. The special effects where amazing i have never seen anything that good in my hole life. Darren Doane where the perfect choice for directing this movie he knew exactly how this movie should be and he delivered. The only negative about the movie was that it was to short.Story 10/10 Acting 10/10 directing 10/10 special effects 10/10 I would probably rank it #3 for the best movie ever made where lord of the rings is number #1 personallywatch it now!!!	10
Saved My Christmas	None	This movie enlightened me, made me laugh and gave me food for thought. Isn&#x27;t that what Kirk was trying to accomplish? For those of you that gave it a negative review - shame on you. You obviously missed the meaning of this movie. For those of you that didn&#x27;t see it...should. It brought together all the things we think of at Christmas and gave them actual meaning - and how Christ relates to each one. I can&#x27;t wait to see this come out on DVD so that I can share it with those that missed the opportunity to see it with me. This movie also didn&#x27;t give the viewer too much to process - just enough to get the meaning across. It&#x27;s up to me (and you) to delve into God&#x27;s word to learn more to find out more about each of the story lines in this movie. I want to know more...and that is what Kirk Cameron was trying to get us to do. #SavingChristmas #KirkCameron #KirkSavedMyChristmas	10
A History of Christmas Tradition	Canyon Lake, Texas	We wanted to see this movie because we read on the synopsis that it was a Christian explanation of Christmas traditions. As Christians who are a little overwhelmed by the commercialization of the celebration of the birth of Christ, we appreciated the way this movie made us appreciate even the more secular appearing traditions. It all comes down to one&#x27;s posture of heart, whether it&#x27;s one&#x27;s Christmas celebrations or one&#x27;s attitude toward this film. If you just want to escape and be entertained, choose another movie, this is not that type of entertainment. But if you are looking to reconnect with beloved traditions in a more meaningful way, this movie will give you something to think about. We loved it!	10
Not a bad movie -Unfortunately a link to this page was posted....	None	Funny at times. Has a good message. Makes you feel good at the end, restore your faith in humanity. I&#x27;m not too sure about his friend, sketchyI think the idea is correct about putting Christ back in Christmas. I hope it makes a lot of money. Nothing wrong with a GOOD Christmas movie. It&#x27;s a lot better than &#x22;Bad Santa&#x22; or some of the other terrible Christmas movies I will not let my kids watch. The movie seemed a bit long, and the plot was a bit predictable except for the end (I wont spoil it for you) Unfortunately a link to this page was posted on a homosexual website, and they requested that people down vote the movie, so the results we are seeing may be inaccurate :(	9
one star reviews likely not real reviews, activists weighing in on Jesus himself:)	None	Anyone that isn&#x27;t a religion despiser has to be honest; this movie rocks. It was heartwarming adorable and really really fun. Yes the plot was limited, but hey, so are the plots of many very enjoyable entertaining flicks:) It had enough plot to be interesting and enough endearing holiday garb and jingle to boost my holiday season. I am amazed at the emotion ....and sheer LENGTH (college term paper length) of some of the very inaccurate wildly neg reviews. These folks obviously are &#x27;activisting&#x27; not &#x27;movie reviewing&#x27; or they wouldn&#x27;t be so emotional; but rather they would be doing a shorter &#x27;matter of fact&#x27; review,....like is normal:)I saw Saving Christmas at the &#x27;Egyptian&#x27; theater at Arundel Mills mall on Dec 15th. My son went with my husband and I. It was ridiculous that the movie was so hard to find. We drove 30 min to see it:)...because we heard it was really good and represented our heart on Christmas. Regardless of ones view on that matter, there is nothing to despise and attack about this light hearted beautiful film. It is great,exceptional acting (which surprised me). It was really well written and put together from start to finish. Anybody badly bashing this film in an unusually lengthy manner,is simply on a lib activist rant and should be refraining from showing that ulterior nonprofessional motive so obviously:) Mr. Cameron came up with a very good quality film with a well chosen cast. It was a highlight of our Christmas this year and it deserved to be in more theaters! I hope he initiates another film for next Christmas, I would be in the front of the line going in:)	10
What did everybody think this movie was about?	United States	I went with my niece because she wanted to and I was not expecting much. the movie had a nice message, there was no gang wars, no cussing for no reason, no girls dry humping anything in sight. If you want to take a younger person to a move and not have to worry about sex scenes, murders, drug use or exploding cars. I do not always want to go see an over acted movie, with over the top special effects, sometime I think they have some special effect just to show off how great they are, and over directed. Some time you just want to go to a movie with a cheerful message and as a religious person I liked the message as did my niece. I do not need a movie that is as much about evil as it is about good to enjoy myself.	10
Point of View	United States	Really, why are so many atheists even rating this movie? Did they really watch it? Why would they? I can see why they would hate it, and I don&#x27;t blame them. It&#x27;s totally opposite their point of view.I gave it a ten rating, not because I&#x27;m trying to help out Kirk Cameron, although I have to admit it&#x27;s not the greatest movie I&#x27;ve ever seen. I can&#x27;t even say I agree with everything in the movie. But - and this is important to me when it comes to movies - it made me think. It made me want to go home and do some research. And I found that there are other sources out there who back up what the movie says. Also, I did think the movie was funny. Maybe I&#x27;m just easily amused.	10
Funny and Faith based movie	United States	This movie is extraordinarily different than all other Christmas movies. It&#x27;s sometimes hilarious and serious about faith other times. I&#x27;ve been ready for years for someone to take Hollywood head on with the truth about the true meaning of Christmas! If you&#x27;re looking to have a good time with your kids and let them watch something that will leave them with a better curiosity of what Christmas means, then check this movie out at your local theater. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the movie won&#x27;t win an Oscar, but you&#x27;ll have a smile on your face when you leave the theater. Kirk Cameron takes his faith and Christmas very serious and has been trying to get a movie like this made for years. Like most of us, I love all the old classic Christmas movies and will for the rest of my life. But, there&#x27;s not many of them that address the truth behind what Christmas is all about. I recommend this movie to all families!	8
Great Movie	USA	This movie is great and it has a great message. It is everything I expected it to be while explaining in a cue and funny way what Christmas is really about! While it is not a great cinematic production it was never designed to be. It is based around the belief that people need to realize that Christmas is a great celebration and worship of the greatest event in history!! When it comes out on video I hope the tide will turn and more people will accept it for the simple movie of truth it was designed to be. I do not always agree with Kirk Cameron but this time he has the message of Christmas in a great context. Everyone should at least watch this movie one time, Jesus is the reason for the season.	10
To Carnal Christian and to The Gospel rejecting population need to learn Biblical History	United States	This is my updated review on Kirk Cameron&#x27;s Saving Christmas, and it has been submitted to IMDb for review.. Will it be on IMDb? I would say more of a no, than a yes.(1) Book of Genesis and the Origins of trees (God created the trees) and winter solstice (astronomy of the planets aligning with this particular solar system), and their actual meanings; (2) Book of Exodus - specifically about the Tabernacle and what inside of the Structure, and their references; (3) Saint Nick (known as Santa Clause) and that he was part of the Council of Nicea, that he was also born-again, and help others with gifts. (4) Books of the Gospels (which are technically Old Testament) - Tree is the main central theme, in that Christ is God Incarnate (Fully Man and Fully God); He (Christ/Messiah) was born in swaddling (burial) clothes, that He was meant to die. He couldn&#x27;t sin at all, and He was tested at all points, and still did not sin at all; He (Christ/Messiah) was beaten, Crucified on a Roman built Cross, died, covered in swaddling clothes, then buried for 3 days and 3 nights, and rose again (Resurrected). Why did He (Jesus Christ/Yeshua Messiah) do this? He did it for you, for every man, woman, and child is born a sinner because of Adam in the book of Genesis sinned, and we inherited this sin nature. This is what the movie is really about! It&#x27;s about the Gospel, that Christ died for sinners! People who say &#x27;Christmas is pagan&#x27;, need to watch this movie, and then go back to the Origins, from the book of Genesis, whether&#x27;s it&#x27;s in your Torah or Tanak, New Testament, Gospels, History, Apostolic Writings, and/or Bible. This movie is really a commentary of Biblical History, and that you can still receive Salvation for your sins, and that you can be a child of God through Christ&#x27;s Blood Sacrifice (The Perfect Lamb of God, Old Covenant typology).The media in news and movie reviewers view &#x22;evil is good&#x22;, and &#x22;good is evil&#x22;, and view this as the &#x22;worst movie ever&#x22; (in reference to Saving Christmas).. Really, it&#x27;s the worst movie ever? Are you sure? What about James Cameron&#x27;s Titanic, which really wasn&#x27;t about the Titanic? I mean, you see the Titanic here and their, but it&#x27;s about adultery, if you understand the term and it&#x27;s origins: engagement, and it really means = to be married.What about Michael Bay&#x27;s Transformers (2007)? You get the Transformers with very few lines to them (robot characters), and the lines are given to an actor and an actress, who are unknown until this movie came out. I felt like I was watching a cross-between Bill &#x26; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure and Clueless (which I can&#x27;t recommend either movie). I would hear from people in my area, that it was &#x22;a good movie!&#x22; and &#x22;Megan Fox is hot!&#x22;, and in translation: &#x22;Good special effects, hot girl, and no substance to the story at all.&#x22; Is their such a thing called movie plagiarism? It would apply to this particular movie!What about the recent Noah by Darren Aronofsky? This is behind the grade F-, and it fact, this is a very heretical version of Noah. It only had about 5 good points to the mass amount of liberties and rejects the Biblical History altogether..What did these three do, along with other movies who fall hard in Hermeneutical and Exegetical (Science and Art of Interpretation, letting the writer(s) speak for themselves, and having good application to what&#x27;s being written/said) standards? In the fiction historical background, and non-fiction (literal history) accounts who fail to follow manuscripts in history, and it fact, people get praised to doing something that receives an F-, and get ridiculed for A+ when it comes to movies, documentaries, and commentaries. It&#x27;s really: &#x22;Let&#x27;s apply A+ to Ivy Leagues with their buy-out program&#x22; and &#x22;Let&#x27;s apply F- to who understand True Interpretation of things.&#x22;In today&#x27;s society and since the 1920s-1930s, the view is: &#x22;reject it: if it convicts us, you need to a full 180 in your so-called life style (it&#x27;s really a death-style), corrects these forms of so-called theologians views (nazists, fascist, communists, socialists = aka liberal and moderates), has True Supernatural substance to it, and it&#x27;s True Historical accounts, it doesn&#x27;t do my homework (research) for me&#x22; which Saving Christmas actually does. Yep, you get to your homework (research) on this Bible Commentary, Bible History, and actually documentational History (do Origin Source Research)..While the majority of society (not just in North America) embrace superficiality (i.e. Transformers, Titanic, Noah), and reject Hermeneutical and Exegetical standards, and perform Eisegesis (let&#x27;s take a mass amount of liberties, and give a folklore, myths, add deceptions here and their), and it does my homework (research) for me. It&#x27;s: &#x22;Oh, I don&#x27;t have to my homework for me! Hooray! I can be lazy!&#x22; Come on! Push yourself! Overwhelm your selfishness! Do the homework! Stop being lazy!This is a great example, to show, that Kirk Cameron wants to speak the majority who are in the two world-views: (a) Laodicean society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of Revelation, Chapter 3). (b) Corinthian society (In the Bible, in the New Testament, read the book of 1st and 2nd Corinthians).	10
Great Content  Great Quotes... Santas the man!	None	I saw this movie, with a bunch of friends &#x26; family at a Regal theater. Although it was a different style than what I was expecting, in that there was a lot of narration, the overall content was great! Basically, it was a celebration of the meaning of Christmas and it had funny one-liners like...&#x22;Santa&#x27;s the Man!&#x22; Plus, I really enjoyed the scene with the two guys who were rapping behind the mugs were hilarious! Lol #GoodTimes The actual filming too had some nice effects that flowed well with the story-line. I bet most of the people writing reviews are &#x22;haters&#x22; who didn&#x27;t even see it! #YouKnowItsTrue #BahHumbug Great Job to those who made this! Great Information! Merry Christmas!	10
One Of The Greatest Movies Of All Time	United States	I viewed this movie the first week it came out, and it is simply a wonderful movie. Every movie that Kirk Cameron does is great. All freedom loving, patriotic Americans will love this movie. Do not be fooled by all the bad reviews by all the lefty, Obama loving, liberals putting down this wonderful movie. None of the people who have given this movie a bad rating have even seen this movie. If they had actually viewed the movie, they too would love it. The movie itself concerns Kirk Cameron speaking to his brother-in-law about the joys of Christmas and the joys of loving, close knit families. This is another reason all the loony left hates this movie, they hate anything to do with intact, man-woman, families or God. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie.	10
Definitely not a 10, nor a 1	USA	This movie is not a &#x27;10&#x27;, and not a &#x27;1&#x27;, either. Why are the vast majority of the votes either 1&#x27;s or 10&#x27;s, then? Because people are voting their worldview, instead of voting on a movie.It is hard to categorize this film - if I had to categorize it, I would call it a Christian docudrama, or Christian Christmas movie. In my opinion, an hour long television program would have been a better format for this effort, than an hour and twenty minute theatrical release.It is a low-budget digital independent film, and the production values reflect that. It sets out to present a conservative Christian point of view, and does that openly and unapologetically. There was nothing that I found intolerant or mean spirited, and it seemed rather to espouse traditional Christian values of Christmas, such as &#x22;Peace on Earth, Goodwill toward All&#x22; - although that line does not occur in the film.The bottom line is: if you are a conservative Christian, then you will probably enjoy this movie or at least find it interesting. The further your worldview departs from that, the less enjoyable you will likely find it.	6
Semi-documentary--Meant to Inform More Than Entertain	United States	I like Kirk Cameron&#x27;s stuff. Let me put that out there. I understand where he is coming from and tend to enjoy it. &#x22;Saving Christmas&#x22; was informative but draggy. The format--two guys speaking together in a parked car on a driveway--tends to make the movie narrative and leads to an extremely slow pace. With a little livelier pacing and some editing (to remove the pregnant pauses), the message could have been presented in 45 minutes. I did not go into this movie thinking it would be a comedy, so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. However, the comic relief presented was a little strained and contrived.There is, actually, very little acting. The descriptive parts frame a number of vignettes that illustrate what is being discussed. In between different themes, a party is going on. Some of the party sequences made little sense. There is one sequence where two coworkers are talking behind coffee cups (presumably to keep from being seen on video discussing things at work) which has absolutely nothing to do with moving the story and, mercifully, is never addressed again until the out-takes.That having been said, I came away with some information that I did not know or had never thought about before seeing the movie. I believe the message should be heard by Christians and, thankfully, it is aimed directly at Christians. I don&#x27;t feel like I wasted my time in the movie, but I feel like it could have been presented more evenly. My suggestion is to support Mr. Cameron by seeing his other stuff and borrowing this movie from the Church Library.	3
Finally, a REAL Christmas movie	None	A wonderful and fun spirited NON Hollywood movie about keeping Christ in Christmas with NO Hollywood liberal agenda or spin involved. Must see for Christians. No cursing, no questioning God or religion. It was really refreshing when everything that seems to ooze out of Hollywood (including the actors themselves) these days, is either bashing the foundations of this great country or bashing Christians. Kirk Cameron tackles the traditions and questions about Christmas and it&#x27;s commercialization head on and with no apologies. If you are a Christian and it is your favorite Holiday as it is mine, Saving Christmas is a must see.	10
Awesome Movie	Minneapolis, MN USA	I saw the movie, and it was great. Interesting, funny, enlightening - I loved it. On Reddit I saw that readers are calling on &#x22;all atheists&#x22; to give this movie a 1 Star rating - even if they haven&#x27;t seen it. Don&#x27;t believe the low rating its been getting. Very misleading. Kirk does an excellent job of putting together a family friendly film. It&#x27;s not too preachy - it&#x27;s actually anything but that. The characters are endearing. The jokes come at all the perfect times. My family got the biggest kick out of some of the humor. Way better than 99% of the garbage Hollywood puts out these days. I guarantee anyone rating it low has not actually seen it, and are simply haters.	10
Educational movie with a touch of family comedy	United States	Made me think more about the reasons for celebrating Christmas. Helps me to see that I can focus on the true meaning of Christmas while partaking in the celebrations of the season. The main character named Christian did an excellent job and was enjoyable to watch. The others in the cast provided the right amount of lighthearted humor. There was a good balance of scenes between Christian and Kirk Cameron and the main party. Kirk Cameron is known for producing great movies and people have a certain expectation from his films. This film seems to be marketed as a full action comedy which sets expectations different than what the movie actually is. I liked it. Just know it has more of an educational approach with light humor.	7
Perfect film to smash the humbugs	United States	People who are sick of the commercialization of Christmas and are ready to give it all up will appreciate this movie. People who are not familiar with Christianity will not get this movie or think it&#x27;s bogus. However anyone familiar with the history of the church will recognize the story of Nicolas of Myrna and his role in the Council of Nicea. The recounting of the events of the original St. Nick will put a new spin on the Ho Ho Ho! This was a great way to spend an afternoon leading up to the celebration of the birth of Christ. It&#x27;s not a special effects bad guy hero film, but it is what it promises to be and it fulfills its promises well. I highly recommend it and wish it was going to be in theaters longer.	10
Educational Movie - Made For TV Quality	United States	Well we saw the movie. It wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I thought it was going to be a regular movie. Instead, it was an educational movie; he gave you different reasons, ideas and ways to think about the Christmas of today. He also discussed how the different factions would like you to think about Christmas; it&#x27;s all Pagan, there&#x27;s nothing about Christ left in it, why the tree, why the 25th of December, etc., and how to keep it based on faith, etc. Not bad. Internet Haters will hate on this but this movie isn&#x27;t for the regular movie public, it&#x27;s for believers and kids. I do agree that the poster is misleading; if you judge the movie by the poster you would think that it&#x27;s a comedy - family - faith based movie. It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s an educational, faith based movie, with a few laugh, but it&#x27;s not a scripted comedy in the least. Run time was short as well which was good. Pretty tight and to the point.	7
Krik explains to his brother-in-law that Christmas is all about Jesus, but it isnt how his brother-in-law things.	Decatur, Alabama	I loved the movie!!! It isn&#x27;t really made for lost people. It&#x27;s for Christians, and it has amazing points in it!!! It allows viewers to see Christmas in a different way than they ever have before!!! If you don&#x27;t love Jesus then I wouldn&#x27;t say you should go see it. However, if you do love Jesus then you gotta go see this movie. If you think people are no longer focused on Jesus during this time of year then you really need to go see it. I was amazed at some of the things Krik said because I have read and heard the stories he spoke of, but I have never put two and two together. The movie is a must see for any believer, and it&#x27;s very family friendly.	10
