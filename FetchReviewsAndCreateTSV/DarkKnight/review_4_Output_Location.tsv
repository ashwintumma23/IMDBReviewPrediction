Film surpasses the hype	10	United States	Weve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. Weve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.Everything thats been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.For as much action as there is in this movie, its the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.Bales Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Foxs inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. Its not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Jokers stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance couldve pulled something like this off. Thats how difficult of a role this was, and thats why Ledgers performance is so great.This isnt an action movie. Its a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because its all in there. 
Surpasses "Begins" in every aspect!!!	10	United States	Christopher Nolan's second bundle of joy "The Dark Knight" EXCEEDED all of my expectations!!! With the success of 2005's reboot of the Batman franchise, they took what was already established and expanded it, amped it up, and gave a deeper, darker and brooding story that is more gripping and the suspense is likely to catch you of guard several times throughout. Christian Bale delves more deeper into Batman, sworn to fight evil and injustice, though also quite reluctant and uncertain if his crusade can ever end and cleanse his inner turmoil from his fractured soul due to the murder of his beloved parents. But with the help of his trusted butler/ally Alfred (played superbly by Michael Cane) grounds him, gives him moral support, and keeps him in check. But the real star of the show is Heath Ledger as Batman's most deadly enemy, The Joker. I can HONESTLY tell you that: as good as Jack Nicholson was in Batman'89 he is CHILD'S PLAY compared to this Joker. He is sadistic, psychotic, and downright SCARIER and PSYCHOLOGICALLY disturbing than the previous incarnation of The Clown Prince of Crime and Ledger gives it his all to do him justice. Along with the original cast comes some fresh faces such as Aaron Eckhart, Maggie Gyllenhaal and more. I must say though I liked Katie Holmes, Gyllenhaal gives a much better performance and is a far cry from the "damsel-in-distress" stereotype (though there's a little of it, THANKFULLY) that's common in films. Bale and Gyllenhall have MUCH better chemistry this time around more so than Holmes. Even better, the fight sequences are vastly improved and feature more brutal and bone crushing combat than "Begins" in addition to new technology at Batman's disposal.  Also worth mentioning is screenwriter Jonathan Nolan, who gives the film an added frosting to an already delicious cake.  Simply put, The Dark Knight is totally more bad ass than "Begins." The action is great, and the plot is more deeper and engrossing. I applaud Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale, and especially Heath Ledger (who sadly passed away earlier this year) and all those aboard for believing in Mr. Nolan's talents for this second installment. Although some may feel a bit of melancholy over Ledger's death, but as a final note I will say this sincerely from my heart: Remember Heath Ledger and honor him in your minds and hearts not only for his performances, but as a human being and father to his daughter Matilda Ledger. May we issue him best wishes for his family and friends and his daughter for years to come. Remember . . . Honor him not only for this role and past roles, but as an incredible individual and talented actor.  Rest in peace. Heath Ledger: 4/4/1979-1/22/2008. 
Best movie of 2008 hands down!	10	Netherlands	I had the honor of watching TDK during a screening and was completely blown away! This isnt just the best Batman movie ever made, this is one of the best movie ever made. Everything in this film is excellent, not one piece of annoyance.Bale marvels as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Ledger has made The Joker in to an iconic movie villain. His performance belongs there at the top with Hopkins Lecter. The Joker has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villandom. This is the true Joker every Batman fan knows, loves and fears. Ledger deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display.Nolan has made his I will always be remembered movie, this is the crownjewel in his portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate Batman, you will love this film. If you dont, then something beez wrongz with youz! 
Certainly Dark - Worth The Wait	10	Melbourne, Australia	I must say I was excited for this movie since the instant BATMAN BEGINS appeared on screen at the end of the first film. It was always going to be good, and sadly, it was always going to be over-hyped by the advertising warhorses.It is rare though, that a movie can surpass all the hype and pass all expectations on the film. Nolan (The Prestige, Begins) delivers on more than the Joker we remember from the Old Days of Burton and Nicholson. Instead were given a psychopathic sadist who pleasures from sheer anarchy.All the hailing of Ledgers performance are grounded. Watching it will make you feel a different chill down your spine than youd remember from any other film. Its impossible, quite literally to relate to The Joker. He gets inside your head with his stories of how he got his scars, makes you laugh at his sick jokes, then makes you instantly wonder why youre laughing.If Ledger wasnt enough to horrify you - wait for Harvey Dent. Brilliantly portrayed by Aaron Eckhart as Gothams fallen White Knight and Batmans direct counterpart. His transformation will put Tommy Lee Jones portrayal look like childrens breakfast cartoons. Gyllenhaal had perfect chemistry with both Bale and Eckhart, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman both work well as Batmans conscience and of course, Gary Oldman as Lieutenant Gordon were all solid.There are some major differences between The Dark Knight and Begins. Firstly, the music is extremely disconcerted compared with the majestic but unfinished tones of Begins - but it suits the films tone: Anarchy in every sense. There was a more solid singular villain (compared with the many in Begins) - but there was also a lot more henchmen in TDK. The martial art direction was faster and more efficient - as mentioned in the film, learning through experience.I was disappointed at the role of Scarecrow in this film, it just felt like a loose thread and wasnt quite closed up or explained, and the ending, while it wasnt what I expected (others have said that it was predictable, but for me it wasnt) was solid and suited the film well.All in all, this is a film that is quite close, if it isnt already, a masterpiece. Nolan has a great thing going and unlike previous Superhero adaptations (Spiderman and Fantastic Four for example), there isnt campiness creeping in. In face, if Batman Begins was 10/10, The Dark Knight deserves a 12. Quite simply, the best possible sequel that couldve been given.If you watch this (which I implore that you do), you certainly wont regret it. One of the best movies of 2008 (Ill wait till Quantum of Solace comes out before I pass judgement) - but certainly a film worth getting excited for. If you dont like it, then thats also fine - but keep in mind that you probably thought Meet The Spartans was a good movie, so the rest of us wont take it to heart.Stunning in every aspect, and exceeds all hype and expectation... Cant wait to watch it again, or for the Blu-Ray! 
The sequel we deserved to the Batman we wanted	10	SLC, UT	I used to leave a theatre after seeing a highly anticipated movie, specifically a sequel, and be so revved up about what I saw that I would declare that movie to be the best of a series. After each of the prequel Star Wars films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for Dark Knight.Though my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, Dark Knight ably stands on its own with or without Batman Begins. At a two and a half hour runtime, its definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.Christian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.Countering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholsons portrayal is true unpredictability. Its obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isnt easy. How exactly does one take him down when hes woven his harebrained plot around multiple hostages, explosives, or disappearing parlor tricks?Initially, I was uneasy about how the character of Harvey Dent would be handled. In my mind, there was really only one faithful portrayal of him, and that could be found in the Batman animated series of the early 90s. As well as Tommy Lee Jones COULD have handled him in Batman Forever, he certainly did not, though it still was a highlight of that movie. Aaron Eckhart ably assumes the mantle here, delivering a performance out of this world, easily on par with the Batman animated series.Be it known, this caped avenger stands for the good of Gotham City that the police force and its counterparts cant represent, the good that has no jurisdiction, no procedures...and no rules, save for one. I can only hope that weve seen just the prelude to the Dark Knights upcoming legendary battles with the worst of Gotham Citys dark underside.The Dark Knight gets a solid 10 of 10 stars. 
Best. Comic. Movie. EVER.	10	the big city	I thought Batman Begins was a very well conceived and put together movie. We finally get Batman as a fully rendered character. We gain new insight into his motivations and the variables he must contend with in his role as protector of Gotham. We get to see Gary Oldman as an honest-to-goodness good guy. And we get to see Liam Neeson conducting perhaps his strangest facial hair experiment yet.  But after seeing The Dark Knight, Batman Begins will forevermore be viewed (by me at least) as a handy little prologue to a FRICKIN' MASTERPIECE of a superhero film.  To say it's the deepest mainstream comic adaptation ever produced would be akin to calling the Nolan/Ledger Joker 'a bit eccentric'.  While watching it, I found myself thinking it was very long, which is usually a sign that it's TOO long, and therefore boring. But that's not actually the case here. The script is bulging with ideas, philosophical musings, THEMES, which Christopher Nolan is not content to gloss over in favour of cool set-pieces (as many comic adaptations are), but wants to explore, wants to allow the characters to explore, at a logical pace. So, what I guess I'm saying is, considering what it sets out to do, the movie is long ENOUGH, while still constantly holding the viewer's interest.  And that's not to say the thematic exploration comes at the EXPENSE of big action, either. On the contrary, there is some truly awesome stuff going on here. The chase with the truck, for example, is fantastic, and there's some great hand-to-hand stuff too.  But what engages us most is the characters, and, while the script is brilliant (the dialogue is sharp, and quite funny for the first two-thirds, before the drama really kicks in), this mainly comes down to the cast.  Christian Bale. Taller than Michael Keaton was. More menacing than Val Kilmer was. Less like Adam West than George Clooney was. Solid and committed as always. He gives the character LIFE, and actually makes us feel for him. The word 'tortured' keeps coming to mind...and I suppose it's pretty appropriate.  Heath Ledger. Y'know, I'd heard talk of an Oscar nomination, and thought it sounded a bit dubious. A Batman villain? Winning an Oscar? Is that what it's come to? Then I thought, is it because he didn't get one for Brokeback? Or more dubious still...is it because he...died? But...well...how can I put it...?  It seems a bit blasphemous to compare Jack Nicholson to Cesar Romero, but after seeing Heath at work...Jack (who once seemed so awesome) just looks...well...lame.  If you've seen it, you hopefully get what I mean. If you haven't...you need to. You will discover the true definition of commitment.  Maggie Gyllenhaal. I didn't have any problem with Katie in the first one (at the time), but I doubt she could have pulled off the more emotional stuff Rachel goes through here. Seeing recasting was necessary (does Tom have a problem with his wife being involved with Batman? Too many bad memories perhaps? Why am I even talking about such garbage here?) they could have done a butt-load worse than Maggie. She rocks.  As does Aaron Eckhart. But I'm not giving ANYTHING away. Suffice it to say my mind was blown...AGAIN. Makes Tommy Lee Jones look like...you get the idea.  Michael Caine. Still one of my favourite actors. Alfred is the shiz.  Morgan Freeman. Morgan Freeman. AOK.  Gary Oldman. As in BB, no mania. No psychosis. No nervous tics. Absolute subtlety. Manages to hold his own alongside Christian, Heath and Aaron without resorting to parlour tricks. Sign of spectacular talent. Go Gaz.  Eric Roberts! William Fichtner! Michael Jai White! Tiny Lister!  The whole thing is just a big bag of thoughtful, well-executed entertainment. It's equal parts cerebral and visceral. Ideas and action.  I've liked every Batman movie so far (okay, besides Batman & Robin), but this one makes them all look pretty bloody ordinary. 
Batman at his best and beyond	10	United Kingdom	Batman has always been my favourite superhero ever since the first time I heard about him because he his human with no powers, also he is much more questionable than any other superhero. The story of the film is about Batman, Lieutenant James Gordon, and new district attorney Harvey Dent beginning to succeed in rounding up the criminals that plague Gotham City. They are unexpectedly challenged when a mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Joker appears in Gotham. Batmans struggle against the Joker becomes deeply personal, forcing him to confront everything he believes and to improve his technology (which introduces the recreation of the Batcycle, known as the Batpod and the Batsuit was redesigned) to stop the madmans campaign of destruction. During the course of the film, a love triangle develops between Bruce Wayne, Dent and Rachel Dawes.There are now six Batman films and I must say that The Dark Knight is the best out of all of them. The title is good because that is what Batman actually is. It has been 3 years for the adventure to continue from Batman Begins but that entire wait was worth it. Gotham city is very Gothic looking and is very haunting and visionary. The whole movie is charged with pulse-pounding suspense, ingenious special effects and riveting performances from a first-rate cast especially from Heath Ledger who gave an Oscar nomination performance for best supporting-actor. It is a shame that he cant see his terrific work on-screen. The cinematography is excellent which is made so dark & sinister that really did suit the mood for the film. Usually sequels dont turn out to be better than the original but The Dark Knight is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the original like The Godfather 2. I also really liked the poster where the building is on fire in a Bat symbol & Batman is standing in front of it. Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director and his film Memento is one of my most favourite films. He hasnt made 10 movies yet and 3 of them are already on the IMDb top 250. Overall The Dark Knight is the kind of movie that will make the audience cheer in the end instead of throwing fruit & vegetables on the screen. 
The dark and sinister mood of the film really sets the theme of the movie	10	Memphis, Tennessee	(Synopsis) Bruce Wayne/Batman (Christian Bale) continues to eliminate crime in Gotham City with the help of Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and the new District Attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). The Dark Knight wants to finally get rid of organized crime for good and be free of their corruption. Batman soon finds that a new psychopathic mastermind known as the Joker (Heath Ledger) has taken over organized crime. The Jokers plan is to terrify the citizens and throw the city into chaos, and kill Batman. Batman takes the fight with the Joker personal, which makes him confront his own beliefs. The Joker is the most dangerous criminal that Batman has encountered, and he will need all his strength and vigilance to defeat him.(My Comment) This film just blew me away. Christian Bale is a natural as Bruce Wayne/Batman, and Michael Caine fits the part of Alfred, the trusted butler. Heath Ledgers performance as the sadistic Joker was absolutely disturbing and scary yet simply amazing. I would not want to meet the Joker in a dark alley, and whatever you do, dont ask him how he got his smile, especially, when he has a knife in his hand. Ledgers performance has turned the Joker into a new iconic movie villain image. Between all the punches, mayhem, and explosions, there is some good sinister dialog. The movie not only has a lot of action, it also tells the story of the internal struggle that Bruce Wayne is having with being the Batman hero. Bruce Wayne wants to be himself and maintain the difference between himself and Batman. Bruce must decide to follow the code or do what has to be done without affecting his own morals. The movie explores the literary themes of Hero verses Villain, as well as Order verses Anarchy, and the Joker explains to Batman that to have one you must have the other, and because of that, they will always be connected. The movie is long, but it went by so fast. You will love the last 45 minutes, because of the non-stop action with Batman in his new sonic suit and his BatPod. With all the explosions, body count, and the dark mood of the movie, I dont think parents should take young children. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Run Time 2:32, Rated PG-13)(10/10) 
The Dark Knight is as good as everyone says and easily the best superhero film made	10	Australia	I think the big question...or the question everyone actually cares about is this: Is Christopher Nolans follow up to the critically acclaimed 2005 film Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, as good as everyone is saying? Quite simply, yes, yes it is. There is no doubt about it, one of the most anticipated movies of the 21st century duly deserves every amount of praise lavished onto it. This is no ordinary superhero movie, this is a character and dialogue driven piece, not as action orientated as you might expect.I will not go into plot details, because there is a lot of it. However, a basic one sentence summary is: Batman now has to face his most cunning and psychotic enemy, someone with no real motives...The Joker. Now that that is out of the way, I will start off with the actors (and boy, is there a lot to talk about). Christian Bale has done a tremendous job as our beloved Caped Crusader, with him already blowing everyone else out of water with Batman Begins. Bruce Wayne has a flawed personality that hangs on the balance between righteousness and criminal. His perception of justice causes an emotional and personal shift, whether he is a wealthy businessman who fights crime in a gadget-riddled suit or just a normal man who is sick of all the scum in Gotham City and decides to give the law-breakers a dose of their own medicine. Because of this, and Bales tremendous acting, Bruce Wayne is justified, and we emphasise with Bales flawed hero more than any of the other actors. If there ever was an excellent Batman, this is it. The theme of right and wrong is played well with his character here.Of course, I am sure you all want know if Heath Ledger was that good. And I can safely say that he most definitely was. Ledgers Joker is not only the best, but is now the greatest superhero film villain ever. His performance is truly terrifying, chilling, brilliant; any synonyms of the previous adjectives. Every scene he is in is stolen. The Joker truly is Batmans worst villain; cunning and psychotic, nothing quite matches his laugh and sinister makeup. If Ledger nabs the Oscar for Best Actor, I honestly will not be surprised. It is a true tragedy to see such a talented actor fall at such a young age...All the other actors cannot be forgotten, though. Aaron Eckhart has definitely proved himself previously (Thankyou for Smoking) as someone to watch out for. Here, as Harvey Dent (and later Two Face) he is very powerful. All he wants is justice; to bring down every single criminal. Eckhart is the definitive Two Face. Maggie Gyllenhaal as Wayne and Dents love interest, Rachel Dawes is much better than Katie Holmes. Gyllenhaals performance has substance, I really cared for her and her future and she was terrific in every scene. Michael Caine can do no wrong, and as Alfred Pennyworth he provides some comical and emotional scenes. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, although a limited role, does inject some sly humour and much needed morals into the story. Finally, Gary Oldmans Lt. James Gordon is riveting. He at least needs a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his performance as another crime-fighting hero who faces some challenging situations.Wally Pfisters cinematography is simply stunning. Gotham has never looked so good, so big and deep. His wide shots purvey a dirty aura and contribute to the feel of the film. Without it, it may not have been the same. Another Oscar worthy portion, THE MUSIC! With Hans Zimmer AND James Newton Howard at the helm, how could it go wrong? The score sets the mood in every scene, giving an epic and thrilling tone. During the action sequences it really ups the adrenaline. And on the topic of action, The Dark Knight succeeds in having the best fight sequences and car chases in a comic book adaptation yet. With no obvious or over-use of CGI, the explosions and accidents are the real deal. Thrilling, edge of your seat and violent, this is brutally awesome stuff.Nevertheless, none of this would be possible without Christopher Nolan, the man behind it all. Pairing up with the writer (and brother) Jonathon Nolan, the darkest Batman movie yet is the best, and the best so far this year. This does not feel like a comic book film, the dialogue and situations feel so realistic. And, it IS the script that drives this film. The dialogue is very, very well written and is the centre of the conflict and the movie.It may be bold to say this, but this is the best superhero film of all time. There are others that are magnificent (Superman and X-Men are two examples) but this is the most complex, the most dark and the most spectacular and epic of them all. See it for Bale, for Ledger, for the music, the action and for Nolans flawless direction.5/5 and the best film of 2008 so far!! 
The Batman of our dreams! So much more than a comic book movie	10	Chicago, Illinois	I got to see The Dark Knight on Wednesday night, the reason though why Im writing this movie comment this late is because I didnt wanna just jump and say this movie was awesome, I wanted to think it through, still today, I cant stop thinking about this movie! The Dark Knight lives up to its hype and goes beyond it, this is the Batman movie that goes where no other Batman movie has gone before. It gave us a real sold story, we are finally told why the villains are the way they are, how all the injustice in the world can get underneath Batmans skin, how you have to believe that people still have faith in good on Earth. Heath Ledger, I absolutely loved Jack Nicolsons performance in the 1989 film, when I first read that Heath was signed onto The Dark Knight, I was like What are they, kidding?, once you see The Dark Knight... Heath was incredible! Im not going to compare Jack and Heaths performance, because they were two different versions of the Joker, but Heaths Joker was definitely the more scary and intense of the two nominations. You didnt know what he was going to do next, he was so crazy, he was also so charismatic to the point where you could relate to his character, and the worst part is not only that hes crazy, hes driving Gotham crazy and treating everyone like little puppets on strings that he can control, and guess what, he is doing it so well with a smile on his face. This was so much more than a Batman film, this was so much more than a comic book film, The Dark Knight truly delivers with drama, action, romance, horror, dark humor, the study of a psychopathic killer, a detective story. The force behind this epic movie is Christopher Nolan, whos previous film, Batman Begins, didnt really thrill me, but his incredible film making is truly shown in The Dark Knight, the shots that he got of Gotham City were absolutely fantastic and made you feel part of the city, part of the Batman story. One of the things that I absolutely loved about The Dark Knight is that normally with a comic book movie, you know its not real, people dont dress up in costumes, and save the day, villains dont name themselves crazy names and dress in make up or crazy costumes, but The Dark Knight actually makes it seem incredibly real, like it could happen.Bruce Wayne is still learning how to be in his double life of Batman and himself, he has lost Rachel to the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, hes inspiring others who are dressing up as Batman and are trying to take on the villains of the city themselves. But things are much worse when the Joker waltzes into town, and hes going to bring Hell upon Gotham City. Constantly playing with Gothams mind and trying to get Batman to reveal himself, Batman has never dealt with such a psychopathic genius before. The Joker has named himself as the Classy Villain that Gotham needs, he also has brought a new thought into Batmans head of them actually being more alike than different, that Batman completes him, the Joker would be nothing without him. But Batman is relying on Harvey Dent, who is Gothams White Knight trying to put all of Gothams scum in jail. But when the Joker plays Batman and Commissioner Gordon, Harvey and Rachel find themselves in very horrific position and Harvey must discover if he will die a hero or live long enough to become a villain.All the performances are dead on in this movie, now everyones going crazy over Heath Ledgers performance, but one performance I would also love to credit is Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two Face, his performance was just as great as Heaths and made Two Face a human villain. You could understand his hatred and vengeance on what happened to him and why he became Two Face. I know that everyone is saying this but I truly mean when I say this is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. We had some great movies these past few years, but I think The Dark Knight is seriously something special, but I dont wanna build it up too much since some people go to the theater expecting my words to be the same as your own. In my opinion though this is not a great movie, I cant come up with a word describe how incredibly powerful this movie was, to be honest I would go above a 10 rating if I could; this is the Batman film that we have been waiting for. Ive seen it twice in one weekend, Im going to see it three times this upcoming week, I dont mind one bit. I cant wait for the sequel and I would just like to say RIP to Heath, wish he could have seen his breath taking performance as The Joker.10/10 
The Dark Knight ---- Best Batman Movie Ever.	8	Australia	I have just come out of the Dark Curtain Screening for The Dark Knight in Adelaide, and Im blown away.Nolans directing is sublime, the pacing of the movie was so well kept, managing to keep the audience enthralled in an almost 3 hour movie. There were several shots in the film that had me saying Now how in the hell did they do that?!, Brilliant scores by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer. Every actor shines, no one person steals the film. I dont want to say much about it, because whatever is said cannot do it justice, there is enough hype surrounding its release, but its there for a reason. Top Notch film. Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman truly deserves.9/10. 
Heath Ledgers Dark and Brilliant Swan Song	10	London, England	I couldnt believe The Dark knight could live up to the hype. Thats perhaps the biggest surprise. The secret, I believe, is a stunning, mature, intelligent script. That makes it the best superhero movie ever made. As if that wasnt enough, Heath Ledger. He, the newest of the tragic modern icons present us with a preview of something well never see. A fearless, extraordinary actor capable to fill up with humanity even the most grotesque of villains. His performance is a master class. Fortunately, Christian Bales Batman is almost a supporting character. Bale is good but there is something around his mouth that stops him from being great. The Dark Knight is visually stunning, powerful and moving. What else could anyone want. 
A Batman Of Shakesperean Proportions	9	New Zealand	Dark, yes, complex, ambitious. Christopher Nolan and his co-writer Jonathan Nolan deserve a standing ovation. I dont usually go for loud movies filled with mindless gore and violence. The Dark Knight is certainly loud and violent but its not mindless. It has depth and soul. Even the Joker, in an extraordinary creation by Heath Ledger, is deeply human. The natural petulance of Christian Bale makes his ego and alter ego the most fascinating and complex of all film superheroes. Part of the genius of this movie is that Batman himself, in screen time, is not really the lead. My attention was captivated by Heath Ledger and he determines and inspires the breathtaking atmosphere that envelopes Gotham as well as us. The aplomb of Christopher Nolan as a director is mind blowing and his secret, I believe, is his obvious respect for his audience. What hes done is to elevate a popular genre into Shakesperean proportions. Bravo! 
Im sorry everyone, this is no masterpiece.	8	United States	** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolans The Dark Knight is one of the better films in the history of its genre, however, it does not qualify as a masterpiece. In fact, its quite far from such a distinction. It falls short of unquestionable excellence because of a ridiculously high number of plot holes, most of which regard The Joker and his criminal exploits.It is a given that Heath Ledgers portrayal of The Joker leaves us with a character who is thoughtful, unpredictable, ruthless, unrelenting, and arguably insane. That is to say, some inconsistencies in the villain should be accepted, if not embraced. But others, to be frank, are unacceptable because of their stupidity. For example: In the films opening sequence, a clever bank heist spearheaded by The Joker, the crazed clown kills off his partners as the caper progresses. At the time, it made sense. Pretty simple, the more colleagues he kills off, the more money that leaves for him. But later on in the film, The Joker burns his half of the criminal underworlds combined fortune. He makes it overtly clear that he is not motivated by money. Not in the least bit.So why was the money a factor in the opening scene? It shouldnt have been. Uneven scripting there.But thats nitpicking in comparison to the films greater faults. The ultimate reason why The Dark Knight falls short of the masterpiece label is because there is absolutely no way, under any circumstances, at any time, on any planet or in any solar system, that The Joker could execute so many complex plans in such a short period of time.OK, here is where people start saying: But its a movie! It doesnt have to be possible. I know, thanks. I agree, it doesnt have to be possible. But, and this is a huge BUT, a film as ambitious and lengthy as The Dark Knight wants to be taken seriously. Not only does it want to be taken seriously, I think director Christopher Nolan wants Oscar consideration for the work he has put in here, and cast members have been saying regularly that they dont want this to be considered as a mere superhero movie, or action movie. Well if you want to elevate to the level of serious drama, then you have to explain a few things to me.(1) How does The Joker continue to find willing participants in his escapades when all of his previous crew members end up dead or in jail? The guys hes finding to work for him have to be true idiots. Totally brainless. And that doesnt work because The Jokers plans are meticulous and require precise timing and execution. If these goons are dumb enough to work for him, they arent smart enough to be effective as help. Its a perpetual contradiction throughout the film, particularly the second act.(2) Sure The Joker is swift and tricky, but cmon, he doesnt exactly look like a normal citizen. If city-wide security has been heightened to a level never before seen, how the hell is this maniac with a painted face and wacky hair not being spotted? Does he have an invisible transportation machine or something? He doesnt have supernatural powers, so he shouldnt have a supernatural aura.(3) When did he have the time to wire the hospital with bombs? Even if one of his goons did it, how did no one in the hospital notice suspicious activity? What about the assassination attempt on the Mayor? The other cops on the firing line didnt notice the most infamous villain in the city standing right next to them? Why? Because he crouched over a little and tried not to make eye contact with them? Please. I could go on for days, too many plot liberties were taken.Id actually like to discuss the performances a bit. I think the separation between the strongest part and the rest of the cast is the largest ever with an ensemble of this size and magnitude. Meaning, Heath Ledgers performance was far and away the best in this film, better to the point where it bothered me that no one else was in his realm. The scenes where Ledger was off screen lacked the magnetism and intrigue of the ones in which he appeared. Although appeared is probably not the best word, more like dominated. Christian Bale was OK as Batman, but hes almost too stoic for a character with such strong morals and opinions. Hes also a little bit stiff when hes in playboy mode as Bruce Wayne. I think his performance in The Prestige was more emotional, effective, and polished.Aaron Eckhart was all right as Harvey Dent/Two-Face, but the problem was that the vast majority of the time I was seeing Eckhart on screen, not Dent. The same Eckhart we saw in Thank You For Smoking. Also, a man with a finely tuned social philosophy, like Dent, would not totally flip his ideology after the loss of a close loved one. Hopefully the angle is that the toxin causing the disfigurement messed more with his brain than we were led on to believe.Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman were believable as always, but of course they are underused as Alfred and Lucius Fox. Gary Oldman probably contributed the second strongest performance in the film as Commissioner Gordon, and Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Rachel Dawes) was a step up from Katie Holmes as far as execution and timing -- but thats not saying much. I really could go on for days about the unacceptable plot liberties, but Ill spare you. All in all, I liked the film because it had some thought-provoking sequences involving moral dilemmas and intriguing societal questions, and in having such The Dark Knight succeeded in escaping the superhero movie label. But its not a masterpiece.Plain and simply, it has too many holes. 
Batman just got really modern	8	United States	This was the most hyped movie of the year and probably one of the most hyped movies ever. Even with the overhype I had to see Heath Ledger play the joker because the trailers looked awesome. So I finally paid my ticket and watched the movie.The movie starts off really strong, the opening scene was an absolute blast (literally). From that point on though I didnt feel the same action. The rest of the movie just seemed, drawn out and completely over the top. Honestly where did the joker find a rocket launcher in Gotham City? This movie was just too long and much of the dialogue was something that a kid writes in senior creative writing and thinks its brilliant. Also the director did an excellent job of warping the joker from one place to the next, the joker must have had a helicopter or a really loyal taxi driver. One second hes here and the next hes on top of that building. Probably the last straw was when Morgan Freeman showed up. He turns around and the camera is at a low angle as if to show the arrival of Morgan Freeman the ultimate modern narrator who is now in every movie, an older version of Samuel L Jackson who is soft spoken. They kind of made up for it when Debo from Friday showed up as the scary convict on the boat.After sitting in my seat for two and half hours as characters appeared and disappeared the movie finally ended, and it ended in a very clich&eacute; way. Way to say the title of the movie as the last word in the film, thats never been done ever?and The Dark Knight had to include the bain of every modern movie, being able to track peoples cell phone calls. This little gimmick is in way too many movie these days.so ya I sat there for two and a half house and my butt really hurt, I wasted ten dollars on a cool movie, but one that wasnt as good as people claimed. Maybe next time Christian Bale will take some cough drops before showing up on set. 
Lets be realistic.	5	Syracuse, NY, USA	I settled on a 5/10 for The Dark Knight. I appreciated the story structure and all the notes they hit... I just dont think they played them loudly. I dont like re-casting, and the replacement of Katie Holmes/Rachel and the original Barbara Gordon actress (yes, her too, didya notice?) is awkward and distracting. The lack of ANY blood in the film to complement the multitude of beatings and killings (to sustain a PG-13 rating) nullifies the tension that should be present in some brilliantly conceived scenarios. I didnt believe for a second that the victims of several hostage situations (mass or otherwise) would actually lose their lives, because its blisteringly apparent from the onset that this film is a PG-13, and would never disturb its audience beyond the minimum necessary plot points. The Joker is actually underwritten. Ledger was game and his performance solid, but honestly: Throw the makeup and stringy hair on 75% of capable actors out there, and you have the same product. I think Jack Nicholsons output is ultimately more interesting, and I think that Tim Burtons original film, although imperfect, is still the most entertaining in the pantheon.I realize that to hardcore Batman fans, this is a wet dream having the grittiness of the graphic novels transposed to the big screen (if they say so; I say it came close), but riddle me this: If the same script was fashioned into a non-superhero flick, lets say Heat II, and had the same strong performances and production values, would the lack of Batman fan loyalty still rocket it to its current position on the IMDb Top 250? 
Best film ever? You must be batty!	4	United Kingdom	Obviously Christopher Nolan was trying to touch on one of the prominent issues of recent times. That of the environment. He did this by recycling tired old jokes and set pieces from many action films before, and the rest of the plot was salvaged from toilets and rubbish bins. He also comes up with the perfect formula to make a profound sentence, by taking two words that mean complete opposites and shoving them together.Joking aside, after almost nodding off for the first hour and a half the second half of the movie actually was pretty good, albeit drawn out until the ending which was very frustrating. They literally left the joker hanging while dealing with the completely pointless and irrational side-story of two-face. Id have thought that a man of dents resolve would have been made stronger by the events that took place, to get back at the joker and stop such events from happening to other people, instead of deteriorating into the monster of similar calibre to the joker.I really dont think the film got the best out of the actors involved, probably due to the script. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor, but he is completely wasted as batman where he spends most of his time jumping about in a bat-suit using a silly voice, instead of displaying his incredible character acting skills in movies such as American Psycho and the Machinist. Heath Ledgers performance was the only real solid one in the entire cast, however at plenty of times he guilty of completely over-acting. His introduction to the members of the mob was farcical and the laughter in the cinemas was due to the awkwardness and stupidity of the situation.The main reason I think the film totally fails is Christopher Nolans approach of trying to make the film really realistic with an explanation for everything. A man running around in a bat costume and a man dressed up in clown make-up is just to surreal to try and be addressed in this manner. This is why I think the original Batman is a lot better because it didnt try to be ultra-realistic and took the comics and had a fairly serious tone with a very comedic undercurrent. Christopher Nolan undoubtedly has talent as a director, memento, the prestige and even insomnia are all great films but I feel his attempts at the batman franchise are far outshone by Tim Burton.Obviously the film is already a hit and there is nothing anyone can write to stop it from being so, however I must implore you to actually watch the film critically and realise its shortcomings, than get swept away in the hype. 
Surprisingly incoherent and boring	3	United States	I dont think that in my quarter century of living Ive ever felt more disconnected from the pop-culture at large than after seeing this movie. With all the hype and uniform praise I thought beforehand that this is at least a solid piece of cinematic craft, maybe embellished slightly by Heath Ledgers unexpected death.Unfortunately, this movie is rock solid proof that sometimes mass delusion can strike an entire society at one time. There is absolutely no way that this film can be regarded not just as a masterpiece, but even as half-way decent.Lets get to the point. First - the plot. Its just unconvincing as a whole. Batman is basically a side character with little to do as he takes backseat on the Joker train. He whines incessantly about how no one needs him and how he needs to hang up his cape. Do it already! His troubled relationship with Rachel Dawes has zero chemistry and its hard to care about the outcome. The idea of Joker being an anarchist, goalless and malevolent force sounds good on paper, but it translates to aimlessness on the screen. Joker shows up out of nowhere seemingly with no one backing him and then... snap! It seems like the whole world is at his service. Not only he has no trouble hijacking a school bus (and then blending into a line of school buses after driving out of a half collapsed bank), hacking into the public TV feed or rigging an entire hospital with explosives; he apparently does it with such ease that the creators didnt feel the need to reveal a shred of information about how he did it. Many events in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever. For example - what was the purpose of Lt. Gordon faking his death? And why did they make a point of showing the scene where his family is informed of the death - was that just to get the audience to buy into it as well? Thats just dumb and a waste of time. Why did Harvey Dent become evil all of a sudden? Sure he was badly burned, but he had to know the risks going into this business and he had a steely resolve just minutes prior. There are many other plot issues, but its pointless listing them all. They are there and easy to spot.The acting in the movie is a-OK, but most of the actors just dont have any good lines as their characters are irrelevant puppets. Heath Ledger is good for sure, but his take on the character gets tedious after a while - mostly from overexposure. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a good actress, but shes just so wrong for the role. Shes a nice-girl-next-door type and as superficial as it sounds, its hard to believe that she would have two hotshots like Harvey Dent and Bruce Wayne chasing after her. Christian Bale has zero material to work with and theyve turned Morgan Freeman into a moralizing nerd. Gary Oldman, Aaron Eckhart and especially Michael Caine do a decent job considering the script they were given to work with.The screenplay is atrocious, incongruent and messy. Its like the movie was cut-up into a thousand pieces of varying length, reshuffled and then strung together. There is no natural progression of events and subsequent scenes frequently befuddle. It takes a couple of minutes to figure out what the hell is going on or why should we care. Its just poorly done.For all the car chases, fight scenes, and giant explosions, the movie is just unforgivably boring. Its a combination stemming from a poor script, naive (or barely existent) plot, flat characters (that cant be remotely identified with much less loved or hated), and a general lack of good sense. There is also an annoying feeling that the creators had a rather low opinion of the viewers intelligence or maybe they just rushed the movie and had to come up with a lot of material in a little time, hence the low quality.Before I end this overlong diatribe, let me just mention three scenes that I absolutely cannot get over with in terms of their pointlessness and stupidity. 1. Batman is riding his wicked-cool motorcycle approaching an aftermath of a multi vehicle crash and accelerates aiming it straight at the Joker. What he is trying to accomplish is never explained. One thing certain is that at the last moment he veers right, barely avoiding the villain, and drives his bike without touching the brakes, straight into a wall. I mean he drives it into a wall (or overturned truck, cant remember) full speed like a blind man. Had he even chosen to hit the Joker, how the hell did he expect to stop? 2. This one actually occurs a couple of times at least. Batman leaps out of a 20th story window and falls onto the ground unharmed. Unharmed! He didnt have a parachute, a bungee cord, and he didnt even spread his cape on the way down. He just hit full blast and walked away. And on one occasion his squeeze Ms Dawes fell with him and experienced a similarly puzzling lack of after-effects. Filmmakers, needless to say, didnt find it prudent to even try to provide some explanation.3. Joker enters the hospital in a nurse uniform. That should present a logistical problem by itself, but OK. However, not only he seems to move around the hospital freely, he also does it still wearing his face paint. I mean the lower half his face is covered by a protective mask, but the rest is clearly visible. Whats even funnier is that Harvey Dent looks at Joker straight in the eyes and the face paint doesnt give him away until he takes of the mask. Is this a cartoon? 
One of the Best Superhero movies EVER!!!!!!!	10	None	I saw the dark knight about three years ago when I was in the 8th grade. And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesnt, dont waste your time write bad reviews about this film. 
very weak, unfortunately	1	Canada	Im very disappointed and this rating reflects my disappointment. It could have been so much better, easily. First, its as if theres no obstacles the characters couldnt overcome by snapping their fingers. Its just too easy for the Joker and Batman to do all what they do. It seems the writers didnt want to be bothered by realism and its one of the main reasons I didnt feel involved or excited at all. Batman pulls out technological rabbits out of his hat to move the plot forward - its contrived and not entertaining. The Joker sets bombs anywhere he wants without facing any obstacles. His team of super terrorists can fill a whole hospital with explosives in a few minutes after it has been evacuated - or was it before? Anyway we dont see them setting up anything, everything is done off-screen and it goes into action without any kind of dramatic buildup. How did his gang do this or that? Doesnt matter cause theres an explosion coming soon. *YAWN* The Joker starts with a small gang but in only a few days or so it seems he builds a big organization capable of operating rapidly without flaws - a group we are told made up of many schizos and psychos from Arkham Asylum, as if they had all been released all of a sudden to join him and moreover in doing so became hyperobedient and hypercompetent robbers / explosive experts / terrorists / etc. Yeah. Right. As if running a criminal organization made up of Arkham inmates would be a piece of cake. It would have been so much more REALISTIC and ENTERTAINING to see the Joker having to deal with nutty and sometimes incompetent henchmen and we the viewers doubting whether or not he would succeed and yet pulling it off and laughing all the way up to the last confrontation. Instead he surfs on the action, survives all kinds of explosions and crashes and moves around as if Gotham City was butter and he a hot knife. *YAWN* Second, the style & editing of the movie was mediocre at best. You would think the Jokers first meeting with the mob would have something of a tension. Here we are introduced to Batmans no.1 enemy and he tells them they have to kill the Dark Knight. But the way it was shot the scene was cold, he simply goes in, makes a few enemies and leaves. And next The Joker invites himself to Bruce Waynes party to kidnap Harvey Dent and he simply comes in, Voil&agrave;!, without facing any obstacles, theres no buildup, no dramatic crescendo, the pace stays the same, we get lots of quick shots, a constantly moving camera and even one or two 360 degrees around Joker and Rachel as if this was some kind of music video. Theres nothing, no tension. And it went downhill from there, like a typical dumb action movie. Explosion, car chase, car chase, explosion, fight, car chase, explosion. Cant you guys come up with something original? And those action scenes arent even well made. *YAWN* Why? After all you had an ace, The Joker, he should have had some cool crazy ideas to cause mayhem... but he didnt. He lacked the charisma that should be in such a character. Not that Ledger is bad but the character he plays has nothing special. Hes cold, predictable and not funny. In Tim Burtons movie the man isnt just some psycho killer, you know early in the movie hes going to do his crimes with style and that he has surprises in his bag. Hes a bit silly but you dont know what to expect from him - hes fun to watch. In TDK he neither has style nor surprises, HE JUST BLOWS THINGS UP WITH DETONATORS and hes not even having fun. Bbbooorrriiiinnnggg.I think a lot of people dont see all the big flaws of the movie because they like the characters and the themes. I like Batman, the lone vigilante fighting crime in his city and his struggle to retain his morality while confronting the worst criminals, I like Harvey Dents character and the Joker trying to turn Dent into a madman like him to ruin his crusade against crime and I liked the Joker trying to corrupt the people of Gotham and turn them into murderers ...BUT THE MOVIE SU CKS I really wanted TDK to be good, good at least like half of Batman Begins is, I wanted to leave the theater with a big smile on my face but I left the theater feeling cheated because I wanted to see a cool movie and I didnt, I saw a lame piece of crap. There was no climax, no great scenes, no drama, no tension, no substance, only over the top action scenes we have already seen elsewhere. This movie itself isnt a 1 out of 10 but Im so disappointed by it that it deserves its 1 
Mediocre	1	United Kingdom	I completely fail to see how this movie could be considered, even at such an early stage The greatest movie of all time!Heath Ledger is pretty good in it, but not that good. It is a good performance, but essentially he is just playing a pretty generic psychotic role in the mantle of the joker. Christian Bale is completely wooden in his role as Bruce Wayne, Batman is a minor character. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are there to lend credibility, but do very little. Aaron Eckhardt plays the rather bland Harvey Dent, but again, not a terrific performance.This is a ridiculous movie, based upon a ridiculous concept that takes itself so seriously that I found it painful to watch. The script is in parts cringe worthy. The plot is incoherent, there are no real character arcs, save for Harvey Dents and it is very poorly executed. The sonar imaging using Gothams 30 million mobile phones was a real jump the shark moment.The violence is extreme, especially when you consider Batman is essentially a childrens comic. The movie revels in sadism and extreme violence, shame on Christopher Nolan for the glorification of this.The art direction extends to a few Batman gadgets and some lo-fi emo make up on the Joker. No effort whatsoever was made to show Gotham as anything other than a generic American city.Glaring plot holes abound, from dogs chewing through the bat-suit where as bullets have no effect to Joker somehow being able to blow up an entire hospital despite giving prior warning! Joker describes himself as an agent of chaos who just does random things, yet everything he does is meticulously planned. The joker has no real sense of humour, he rarely ever smiles which is a total deviation from the comic character.This film - for me personally - signifies the death of the blockbuster. It might have made a vast amount of money at the box office, but i sets out to appeal to the lowest common denominator.The Dark Knight is a humourless, negative, sadistic movie with no substance to it, a weak script, which as one reviewer pointed out that for all the pseudo-intellectual monologues and pseudo- philosophical rambling just ended up with someone getting punched or shot.An immature film that should be for kids, but was really made for adults.I dont want to see it again, it was a waste of time. This is film as junk food, it is bad for the soul. 
Fantastic!	10	United States	Im just gonna start off by saying I LOVE this movie.Its one of my favorites of all time. I honestly cant think of too much wrong with this movie other than its a little long and Batmans by now infamous voice. But everything else is top notch. The acting,story,atmosphere,and actions scenes are all amazing. If you havent seen this movie see it right now! I went into this not expecting to much but I came out blown away, I cant imagine any movie being much better. Ill just have to wait for The Dark Knight Rises to release to see if anything can be better. Until then, this stands as the best movie Ive ever seen 
Why so happy? Lets put a frown on that face!	1	United States	I know this review will get a bunch of unhelpful votes but somebody has to tell the truth here! The Dark Knight is wildly overrated and is the most overrated movie of all time. Forget Titanic, Boondock Saints and King Kong(2005). This movie surpasses them when it comes to sheer hype. For the record I love Batman Begins. I thought it was a fresh beginning on a series that was rendered ineffective by that lunatic Joel Schumacher. Christian Bale fared well as both Batman and Bruce Wayne and the rest of the cast did a great job also. But this movie.... Everything that made Batman Begins so great is absent from this pretentious slop. Most of the cast look like theyd rather be somewhere else. Let me break it down this way with what stinks about this movie.The plot: Idiotic beyond belief. Joker(Heath Ledger) plans to kill city officials while playing childish games with Batman. Most of the time hes killing the people hes aligned with making him the most moronic villain in superhero movie history. Batman joins forces with Commissioner Gordon to stop him.The acting: Christian Bale is wooden in both roles(Batman and Bruce Wayne). He spends most of the movie looking like hes stoned out of his mind. And what is up with that voice? In Batman Begins he sounded cool like one of the gangsters from those old 1940s flicks. Here he sounds like Dirty Harry with strep throat. Aaron Eckhart is flat as both Harvey Dent and Two-Face. While his Two-Face was better than Tommy Lees Two-Face looking good by default is never good. Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman sleepwalk through this whole movie. Maggie Gyllenhaal is quite awful as Rachel Dawes. Katie Holmes Rachel Dawes was a strong willed lawyer that fought for whats right. Maggies Rachel Dawes needs to grow up and find some better priorities. I agree that she is a step up from Katie Holmes but she plays Rachel Dawes like some silly high school girl with a pathetic crush on Bruce Wayne. The fact that we are asked to feel sympathy for her when The Joker captures her is a bit of a stretch. Her getting roasted made my day though lol!Now for the talk of the town: Heath Ledger as Joker. Heath Ledgers performance was okay but to say that he was better than Jack Nicholsons Joker is hilarious to say the least. Jack Nicholsons Joker had style, a plan and was pretty funny as well as unpredictable. Of course he was silly but he was fun. Heath Ledgers Joker is predictable with no back story and had no real plan. Just random acts of chaos. Ras Al Ghul had a plan, The Joker of Batman 1989 had a plan, The Penguin of Batman Returns had a plan. This weirdo had nothing but bluff. Plus hes has no fun with what he does and spends most of the time ridiculously philosophizing like those corny emo-goth kids that smoke copious amounts of cigarettes while yapping about the misery of their lives. You complete me? Thats about as cheesy as the Tumbler turning into a crappy motorcycle. Speaking of Emo-Goth kids that exactly what this Joker is. Only people actually find him cool instead of pathetic.Action sequences: predictable to a fault. Car chase and fights scenes plus they are quite unrealistic. People get punched, kicked, shot, bitten by dogs and knocked around by explosions and walk away without bumps, bruises, cuts or blood. Now, Im not a gore hound but if you get shot or bitten by a dog, I would expect to see some blood. Not in the Dark Knight though. Pacing: The movie builds up a pace to slow it down after wards and with all the action on the screen the movie still finds time to be boring. Plus at 2 hours and 32 minutes this movie feels longer than it needs to be. Various subplots that never connect best describe most of this movie.Conclusion: The Dark Knight is the most overrated, most hypocritical, most pretentious piece of garbage in the history of cinema. The only people that would like this are the fanboys and I cant believe that people are trouncing Tim Burtons Batman movies to foam at the mouth like rabid dog groupies over this overcooked sequel. You pseudo-intellectual snobs dont seem to realize that those movies were great for the time they were made in and they were fun. Tim Burton made the type of Batman movie he wanted to make without trying to please these shills. I must have seen the Tim Burton Batman movies more times than I can count and still have a ball watching them till this day. I saw this dreck three times and still couldnt get into it. Its not even fun. Its a plodding mess that gets more hype than it deserves. Matter of fact, Ill tell how much I didnt like it. For months I had The Dark Knight on my computer for free via z-share and when my computer suffered from a virus that force me to erase the whole thing, this was the only movie through z-share that I never tried to get back. That should tell you everything you need to know about my feelings on this movie. Two Thumbs down. 
Erm...really? (may be a couple of spoilers)	1	United Kingdom	Wow. Once again my faith in the rational persons ability to discriminate between depth and breadth, is verified, in that I have none.The film was long. Not deep. I think there is a misunderstanding. The film had the veneer of an epic film. It had all the right elements to be an epic comic-book adaptation to screen. Yet it faltered, mainly because everyone was so wrapped up in the idea of Ledger giving a career defining performance, they couldnt see past it. Its almost as if they accepted the brilliance of his performance before they entered the theatre, off of the back of the hype and the critics reviews, and all that was left was to actually watch it and be able to validate this belief.Disregarding Heath Ledgers untimely death, can you really say that he was a better Joker than Jack Nicholsons? I for one, cannot. Others have already said it; he had no back story. A character without a past and a motive - especially when they are a killer - is just not one that is appropriate to a story about good and evil. The things we like about villains is that we can relate to the reasons they do the things they do, whilst asking ourselves whether their reasons are justified. We get into a dialogue, and we ourselves get to decide who we side with - the good or the bad. This villain left me feeling flat and unfulfilled because he had no real motive, - making it impossible to choose which argument, good or bad, I sided with - and left me feeling like I was a voyeur, watching a guy kill loads of people.Everyone has been raving about the script, which I thought was plain dreadful at points. Others have raised the questions here. What was with his voice? He would make a great nursery nurse. The poignant moment on the boat when the sailor said something to the effect of They havent pushed the button yet, because we are still alive was just plain embarrassing. The fact that Batman kept leaving in the middle of a conversation became irritating instead of cool and enigmatic. Why cant he just hear someone out. And at the end when batman runs home like Charlie, I was nearly dying in laughter. I could hear the music Ive got a golden ticket. There were other embarrassing script moments, but because the film was so bad, I cant even be bothered to mention them. The phone device for one was utter...The rhetoric of the characters in their oratorical moments was again, limp. It was as if the writer had started a sadistic, flowing evil speech, but had not had the tools with which to really elaborate. Because he had decided to keep the Jokers background exclusive, the speeches were neither funny or scary. They were punctured and lacked conviction.The fact that this is the number one movie is embarrassing. IMDb should take it off out of principle. If this wins an Oscar, I will never watch a Hollywood movie again. 
The Dark Knight Delivers	10	United States	The Dark Knight maintained the intensity and overall gunmetal grayish feel that sets this Batman apart. The film takes us to a Gotham City that has grown accustomed to the big bats crime-fighting crusades, and the last remaining big time criminals have actually grown fearful of his wrath. They form an alliance to attempt to keep their illicit business activities alive but are feeling even more pressure from yet a different angle: the passionate and fearless new district attorney, Harvey Dent. Recognizing the crime groups looming extinction, a stranger enters their circle and offers what he thinks is the only solution: kill Batman.The bad guys dont know if they can trust this seemingly demented madman, and they later learn the hard way that they dont really have a choice, for the most disturbing part of the Jokers personality is his motive. He doesnt care about money or power. He just enjoys causing trouble and watching, with pleasure, from the sidelines, as the terrorized city scrambles in mayhem...which leads me to the real star of this film, Heath Ledger.Ledgers performance as the Joker is astounding and consuming. We come face-to-face with a villain bearing the coldness of a psychopath and a personality that remains as mysterious and inexplicable as the real reason for the scars on his face. He develops the air of the lone offender quite early on as he nonchalantly kills those who help him commit his crimes. Yet, he has no problem building an army of followers, and the viewers easily find that believable. As insane as he is, hes focused and quite determined. Ledger also brings the Jokers humor to the role, but he does it in a way that is unique to this interpretation...with subtlety and honesty. The very words and mannerisms that made me laugh also evoked feelings of sadness in its clarity. The evil is incredibly convincing.Although Batman is a character that is often marketed towards kids, this film is definitely not appropriate for young children. In addition to the dark images, the violence, both seen and implied, is sometimes unsettling, and Ledgers Joker is chilling even for adult viewers. Having said that, this is, by far, one of the best films Ive ever seen, and it will easily find a place in my personal top ten. I am only disappointed that this Joker, the best villain in a film since Hannibal Lecter, will never be revealed to us again. 
Not impressed	4	Maynooth, Ireland	I know I am going against the tide here. And I am happy that so many people had a good experience watching this film. I didnt. Maybe I just dont get it? Im not sure, because I am a fan of superhero films in general. I think perhaps what I dont like is a superhero film that tries to be so serious as to make us believe in it. Batman, and previously I would say Unbreakable, fall into this category. If you want me to take you seriously then tell me this. How the hell does a guy with his face painted run around a city causing mayhem without getting caught? How does a guy who kills his accomplices continue to have support? I mean he even burns the loot so money isnt the answer. How does a guy who claims he doesnt like planning (because hes too crazy to care about planning) manage to get so many barrels of oil and dynamite positioned all around the city with ease. How does he get said equipment on to the two very important ships? A city that is on high alert? Was there nobody to check? The list goes on and on. If the film wants to be taken seriously, I think it has to fill these holes. If it doesnt, then no problem. There can be as many holes as you like.Another bad point was the length of the film. Far too long.On the plus side the acting was very good, although I didnt like the overly put on voice of Batman. However, Ledger deserves all the praise he has been getting for this. 
Ledger saves pretentious, overwrought superhero movie	6	United States	Oddly enough, I dont go into a theater before watching a blockbuster movie with the expectation that itll be over-hyped and bloated; thats just how it turns out from time to time. No, I have reasonable expectations just like the next guy.As I check out the reactions to The Dark Knight, I notice a common thread - everyone likes the movie. Particularly, everyone seems enamored of Heath Ledgers unhinged, magnificent, and terrifying performance as The Joker. Straight out, I want to make clear that I completely agree. Ledger isnt just some ham acting out in a clown costume; we had Jack Nicholson do that already, nearly twenty years ago. Ledger commands the screen not with an over-the-top performance but a scene-stealing, subtle one. His makeup masks not only a despicable demon who hurts for the sake of causing pain but also a troubled, carefully shaded character worthy of Shakespeares finest plays.Lets first get to what I didnt like. Many of the main roles are miscast, sometimes badly so. Christian Bale returns as the Caped Crusader, but if anything his performance is more wooden than in the movies predecessor, Batman Begins. See, Ive always thought the complex Batman character should be someone whos consumed by inner demons, one who even when unmasked reveals only some layers while hinting at much greater depths. And I never get that impression with Bale as Batman: He is what you see, and little more. Yes, we know hes got this secret identity thing going, and he doesnt tell people everything, and thats nice. Endearing, even. But Bales inadequacies as an actor show up in spades here, because I never get the feeling that theres more than meets the eye. Bales Batman doesnt feel like hes consumed by demons in the least; he seems like a pretty boy with a lot of money who likes to torture (yes, torture) and kill bad guys without any of the blame or acclaim.Moving along, we have a new Rachel Dawes, aka The Love Interest, played this time by Maggie Gyllenhaal, whos a monumental improvement over the wretched performance that Katie Holmes gave in Batman Begins. Even so, as has been noted elsewhere, Gyllenhaal is too intelligent, her eyes too ironically knowing, to play the role. She seems out of place, because shes smarter than Rachel Dawes - an assistant DA - is. (Of course, we dont see much of Rachel doing DA stuff; we see her running from place to place in a panic, or professing her love for Harvey Dent through nonverbal ways, or smiling coquettishly.) So: Like the Maggie Gyllenhaal, a LOT, but she was far better than her character was written. Someday theyll get it right.And then theres the third wheel to the love triangle: Harvey Dent, played by Aaron Eckhart. Now, you have to set aside Tommy Lee Joness performance as Dent in one of the earlier Batman movies, because this is a new Bativerse, and its like those other movies never happened. Dent eventually becomes the physically and mentally scarred Two-Face, but Eckhart cant quite handle the heavy lifting that the complicated character demands. When you see Eckhart, you think of likable cad, the slightly slimy guy whos better than the real hero at basically everything. But in a charming way. Here, Dents a noble crusader, the district attorney whos going to clean up Gotham, but Eckhart is just another toothy, slick, Ken doll whos there just to look good. The way Eckhart plays Dent, youd think he was just an affable fellow who wants to do the right thing; as with Bruce Wayne, there doesnt seem to be any undercurrent of ulterior motives, nothing to see here, please disperse. Eckhart, despite having studied split personalities in preparing for the role, is clearly in way over his head here.The movie itself is overlong, even bloated. It seems the in thing nowadays to have a movie end several times - you know, to keep the Great Unwashed on their toes. Oh my goodness! Its not over yet! What will happen next? But surely theres a way to do this without producing a film thats two and a half hours long. If youre going to make a movie that long, be my guest, but the movie should be more than our heroes running from action scene to action scene, particularly when those action scenes are in dark, dank Gotham City.But here are some positives, to make sure all bases are covered. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency as Lucien and Alfred, respectively, doing far more for the movie than it for them. Both act as Bruces conscience, and both roles were written as to be completely believable. Professionalism is always a plus when casting superhero movies. And some of those vaunted action scenes are a lot of fun to watch, although many of them seem to involve Batman jumping off a building, Batman climbing down the side of a building, or Batman throwing someone else off a building. In the dark. Because its supposed to be gloomy ol Gotham.So for me, The Dark Knight was a disappointment. Its not a bad little film, but it felt too loose, as if writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan had decided on an ending and then threw everything they could think of into the plot to reach that goal. This happens to a lot of middling action films - the hero races to point A, escapes certain death, races to point B, escapes certain death, repeat ad infinitum. Same sort of thing here, only we dont even get clever plotting that we might expect from whats purportedly a higher grade of superhero movie. Theres much chaos in The Dark Knight, but ultimately the maelstrom of disorder consumes, rather than engages, the viewer. Dark Night is elegy to the great potential - realized and unrealized - thats forever lost with the death of Heath Ledger. 
The Dark Nothing	1	eel, utah	This was one of the worst movies ever made. Never before have I witnessed a more confusing and convoluted mess. There were about ten subplots, but there was no main plot. The Joker existed to run amok and to represent the honest villain, that is, he didnt mess around and play games like most villains, and he didnt do it for money, he just killed and wreaked havoc for the heck of it... okay, thats fine. But in having the Joker purposely ruin all the other subplots involving other bad guys, it basically made all the energy in having to keep up with the subplots involving these other people come to nothing. It was very tiresome realizing that everything you witnessed, after two hours of non-story action and hammy performances, really didnt mean a thing, kind of like when a movie shows that its all a dream. It might as well have been a dream. Because in this complete mess of a film, nothing mattered. The Joker had no purpose - which was intentional. But since the rest of the movie had too much purpose, or rather, tried too hard to have all the purpose in the world - it all came together like a big explosion... then, nothing. Just ruins. And two and a half hours of my life wasted. As for Heath Ledger, he wasnt terrific. He wasnt amazing. He was horrible. Weak. Sounded like a nerd. And he claims to have studied from A Clockwork Orange (please!), but he seemed more like he was doing a Johnny Depp impression, being silly and androgynous. Its just such a mess of a film. Horrible, simply horrible. And the reason I havent mentioned Batman himself, is that he was so nothing, that there isnt anything to say about him. The main character seems more like a Vin Diseal character, and not a comic book hero. I understand trying to make the franchise more serious after being ruined by Joel Schumaker, but this film doesnt resemble a comic book in any way at all. It could have been a cop film, only the main cop had pointy ears, and the main villain had really bad makeup. 
warning contains spoilers, OVERHYPE, NON-EVENT	1	london england	How can a film like this be ever compared to a film like the godfather is laughable, i am a big comic book and superhero fan i particularly like this genre but i did not like the way this was handled whatsoever..the following points highlight my case why batman is nothing but a okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION AND CREATION everyone knows that one of the most exciting things about villains is there creation, and how they became they way they are, i believe the original batman films which Tim Burton directed handled this brilliantly, but look at Spiderman 2 which has a great villain. There was no flashback even to the creation of the joker character we must believe he has been there all along, as well as Two Face whos original coming of being i liked better in batman forever, not to say i like tommy lee Jones character portrayal any better than this 1.2-VIOLENCE this film had left a bitter taste after viewing i am a fan of violent films but it can be seen the way this was edited to ensure the upper catorgory of a pg-13 12a(uk) over here left the film looking a feeling like something was missing. Instead of showing the conseqeunce of for example a bullet in the head the camera would cut away leaving it for the audience imagination, another example of not showing violence and actually changing the tone of the film was robocop the R rated version when compared against the X rated version which seems lighter in tone.3-BATMAN now Batman played by Bale one of my favourite actors opted for a stupid gruff sounding voice which didnt work, also the suit castes were terrible and i mean truly bad, batmans suit made him look like a more well equipped navy seal or something, not the true mysticism that is batman which is lost in this film. There is no reference to bats whatsoever throughout the duration. Another letdown was the fight sequences which even though Bale did a lot himself did not look smooth, or good on the big screen.4-PLOT/PACINGthe plot has to many twists and turns and leaves some of the less cerebral most likely lost(not myself of course). The pacing is bad as there is one key action sequence in the middle of the film which did blow me away but the film never lived up to that particular sequence which is a shame, less morality and preachyness more ACTION! and on that note a spoiler which i do warn before hand, the ending i must say i disliked a lot, for lack of realism, depth and completion as it is left very much open of what happens to the joker character, my 2 cents please reply if you have maybe a differing opinion to mine, Spiderman 2 is one of the greatest comic book translations to films, as in the earlier batmans, (including returns) but this should never be uttered in the same sentence as a film like the Godfather, which i believe to be one of the greatest of all time, the greatest which i do believe is Once upon A time in America. 
Bold without ever being especially great, and which progressively gets less-interesting; the film is a wild concoction of ideas that just about treads water.	6	Hampshire, England	Some of the very first words Christian Bale utters as the eponymous role of soon-to-be-Batman Bruce Wayne, in the preceding Batman film to this entitled Batman Begins, are to a thug in a remote prison located in the Far East: youre not The Devil, youre practise he hisses. The feelings that 2008s The Dark Knight is where the practise ends and the fight with The Devil begins. This is my second crack at writing something up about the film, and while what I said initially was a little unfocused and targeted the wrong areas; I stand by the initial grade I gave it and similarly retained that similar sense of feeling underwhelmed when it finished. Even if it is deemed that The Dark Knight is one of the better comic book adaptations ever made, this is not saying a terrible lot given the bulk of entries in said film canon.That old problem of dealing with the war genre and doing ones very best to document war as a horrid, gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequences of war that cannot help but carry a sense of spectacle anyway, rears its head here. The Dark Knight documents a war on terrorism and sees Christohper Nolan attempt to echo a greater sense of things in the real world as he unleashes a character known as The Joker (Ledger) amongst the inhabitants of Gotham City, The results of his terrorist acts in bringing down entire buildings allow Nolan to shoot the wreckage of said act with firefighters in the foreground and smoking rubble in the back, clearly calling on immediate post imagery of the 9/11 New York attacks. Incidentally, and as one source which escapes me suggested, Jokers videos of captives held and forced to talk into video cameras evoke the actions of overseas terrorist cells, and their own methods of getting the message across to The West; while most of his scenes in which he is seen pottering around an area trying to intimidate carry an odd, distorted and erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger, distortion and chaos. Later on, semiology linked to fire fighting will be used again in the briefest of fashions, when a certain character, whos under threat from The Joker, is being transported in a police van: a burning fire truck is used as a blockade, and Nolan cleverly instills a further sense of victimised anguish into the audience.In addition to biting all of this off, Nolan does his best to render the film a gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating under this banner of a low MPAA/BBFC rating as the film additionally attempts to draw on parallels between The Joker, Batman and a third piece to the triangle in district attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart). Indeed the film opens with an audacious robbery of mob money, as perpetrated by The Joker; his menace established by the fact his cohorts contribute varying perspectives of the man whilst we perceive him to still be off screen. The robbery itself carries a clever twist in that each member kills the other when his job is done, a small but highly affecting twinge to proceedings as dreamt up by The Joker thus cementing his personality and mindset in being able to cook up something such as this. As a fighter of crime, Dent lacks the physical strength Batman does but talks a good talk and is able to place a number of criminals in jail after some hard work as he adopts his own stance on the front line of crime. Shortly afterwards, it is Gary Oldmans police lieutenant Jim Gordon whom refers to him as Gothams white knight, suggesting the man shares a similar overview to Batmans dark but is just different in technique and characteristics.Jokers parallel with Batman sees the film establish such a relationship by way of two accompanying scenes, one seeing The Joker and a handful of representatives from Gothams gangs occupy a kitchen and talk of certain issues. Annoyingly, the representatives are your more generic bling-wielding African-Americans; well dressed Italian American mobsters and gruff, greasy haired eastern European criminals. Cut to Gordon, Batman and Dent beside the bat signal doing the exact same thing but whose discussions and ideologies obviously differ; a later pairing of sequences seeing The Joker deal with a black criminal, whom he feels ought to be working with him, in a blunt fashion just as Batman does the same to a Chinese businessman named Lau whom he feels similarly towards in this sense, thus suggesting a more intrinsic link between the two. As is the rule of thumb in films such as Heat or American Gangster, Joker and Batman share a sequence in which they sit opposite one another at a table; on this occasion, and as other sources have stated, right before contemporary issues on the treatment of terrorists once in custody have arisen.Where the film falls apart is its want to cater to an audience with superhero sub-genre frills, an interesting parallel drawn up between Dent as a frothing at the mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge and Batman, as two people differently channelling anger born out of injustices towards people they love plays out, but getting bogged down with out of sorts fight scenes and ridiculous sequences in sonar vision which does nothing but juvenalise adult content. Most of the second unit stuff is nowhere near as interesting as the talk and studious observations on identity and personality; a chase through a tunnel which spills onto the streets involving a police van; a large truck and a bat-bike rather underwhelming. The film relies on rife corruption all too often to further its narrative so as to send it down another avenue of twists and turns, ultimately a story which is not as interesting as all the aforementioned character studies and power play going on as binary opposites supposedly attract and everybodys linked to each other. Ultimately only fleetingly interesting, and all too often feels bogged down. 
The film that seems to have fooled everyone!	6	United Kingdom	OK, lets get it out of the way, Im a massive Batman fan. I loved the TV show when I was a kid, really enjoyed the early Tim Burton films and have even worn the costume on a few occasions. Ive even taken the time to read Batman comics and graphic novels. I thought Christian Bale was an excellent choice of the lead role for the new films and thought the first one was a great start and I was really looking forward to this one. So how come Ive just walked out of the cinema feeling very disappointed? Why? Because this film just wasnt that good. Its far too long, has very little fun in it and takes itself so seriously its painful. The makers have thrown the kitchen sink at it with very little thought. The whole thing was one great, big, dreadful, noisy, mess. The only good thing in it is Heath Ledgers performance. I had my doubts when I first heard whod theyd cast but I gotta hand it to Heath, he pulled it off. No thanks to the film however, which is so over cooked its burnt. Sure theres loads of action, cool bat gadgets and lots of running about and shouting but absolutely no soul. It was great looking but has no personality. I felt neither happy, scared or even mildly concerned let alone entertained. I really didnt give a damn. So next time people, slim it down, less is more. Its not Apocalypse Now, put some fun into it.....Why so serious? 
Too many  fans seem to be blown away	6	United States	Many commenters said they were blown away, so it probably has succeeded in blowing away the box office. I waited until the second week, and had high expectations from the 9 and 10 ratings it was receiving. But, fellow movie/film viewers (and especially great film lovers) ... really!? Theres no doubt about the action and action and action in this one, and thus, the special effects. Thats the main reason I enjoy such fantasy flicks -- the comic book genre. So, this one does more of it and perhaps better than the last Batman and the last Spiderman and the last super heroes (but I would not rank it up with Iron Man). So, special effects and makeup may earn it awards.Maybe Im beginning to burn out on all the action and special effects of movies, though. Or perhaps I need more from a movie. With 45 minutes to go, I was ready for it to end. It was way too long. Some reviewers thought the acting was superb. What acting -- do they mean the one- or two-minute interludes between the fast and furious segments of action and destruction? Im not down on any of the actors for their roles or parts -- but where were there any parts of substance in acting? True, Heath Ledger does a very good Joker. But, then, who hasnt (Nicholson, et al) who have ever played those roles in Batman, Superman, etc? As for plot -- well, anyone who knows the genre and a story that combines Batman with the Joker, knows to expect the unexpected with the Joker. So, the plot goes from one unexpected to another -- as though the variety and mixture and change in unexpecteds is trying to outdo the action mayhem.When I saw that this stands as #1 in the top 250 right now, I clicked on the list. But how this movie for acting and plot (and yes, even action in many cases) could rank up there with the likes of the Lord of the Rings, the Star Wars films, and many great classics with real suspense (I have to mention Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest), is beyond me. Im not that far off with the overall trends in the IMDb reviews, but cant agree with so many who rate this film at the top.Its good and entertaining -- but too long. Its not great, by any means. I love the youth of today (I have a few grandchildren), and I dont mean to disparage them by this observation -- but I think this high acclaim by many for this film may reflect a very large, very young audience, most members of whom dont have a great deal of quality and varied films in their viewing history. To all of those young people, I urge a look at the top 250 list or other major review ratings -- and then that you rent, borrow or otherwise watch some of the other great films. I promise you wont be disappointed or bored --and you may get an understanding (maybe appreciation for) of some past customs, life styles, dress, behaviors, etc. To be sure, you will have great entertainment. 
This is seriously the best movie ever made.&#xFEFF;	10	Turkey	This is one of the best Ive watched the movie trilogy. I dont see TDK just as a superhero comic book movie because screenplay was written in a perfect way. Created by Nolan Batsuit-mobile perfect design. The most beautiful thing in the film to return to The Jokers and Ledger as the Joker was created to be such an amazing acting. When good and evil sits down to have a talk like an interrogation scene, everyone in the audience shuts up and listens to what they have to say. Thats I think this movie is great. I just did not like the actor who portray the character of Rachel Dawes. Other than that Nolan and his team did a great job. They can make 100 movies but we will feel its something missing perfect acting, one of the best actors of all time nobody can be better than Ledger as the Joker. 
This generation is too easily impressed.	1	None	This cold, jumbled, autistic, overproduced mess is seriously considered some kind of modern classic? What is there to say? Its just another big, dumb formulaic CGI action movie directed by another slick, boring Hollywood director. It takes a generation deficient enough in the cranial area to consider Pulp Fiction and The Matrix cornerstones of film to think that anything of artistic value can be gleaned from Nolan.Heath Ledger sticks out like a sore thumb because theres actually a sense of improvisation and life to his performance. I dont care what a clich it is, if anything salvages this film, its him. But he doesnt. We get Batman growling like a pubescent Solid Snake, poor pacing that gets you ready for the film to end like three times, tons of video game interludes--Im sorry, I mean tons of CGI--and a big, dumb car chase filled with hilarious one-liners like: not good. Ha ha ha ha! Because, because, thats understating a precarious predicament! Get it? Thats why its funny.Just more Hollywood trash. 
Not Very Good	4	United States	I waited until the DVD came out and the initial media coverage had played out. This movie made money only due to the unfortunate passing of Heath Ledger. Throughout the movie I transitioned from when is this movie going to get good to when is this movie going to end.Christian Bale is a fine actor and we were able to see his talents in the first installment. He had very few scenes where the audience could see these talents in this movie. He was regulated to the Batman Costume and his Clint Eastwood voice impersonation. This was unfortunate. Heath Ledgers performance was good, but not award worthy. He kept sticking out his tongue while speaking to make his character look crazy. Gary Oldman has played much better bad guys in his day and Heath Ledgers performance does not match any of those or Jacks for that matter. Maggie Gyllenhaal was fine but her role was so limited that they could have pulled all her scenes from the movie and the plot would not have skipped a beat. She is a fine actress but we did not get to see much of those talents in this movie.Aaron Eckharts did an excellent job however his characters transformation into Two Face was rushed. It was kind of like they ran out of time and had to rush him into the bad guy role because they spent to much time elsewhere. I will probably check out the third installment when the time comes, but I hope they get back to the format of the first movie. They let the the actors do the work in that version vice putting all the emphasis the superhero & bad guy characters. If they are not going to let Christian Bale act then they can put anybody into the batman suite and it will not matter. This installment is also getting to the borderline where far fetched gadgets are concerned.Its unfortunate this movie made so much money as it will give the production team a false sense of accomplishment. If they repeat this performance they will bomb next time around unless they catch another break with another unfortunate off set tragedy. 
Very Good, But Yikes, Lets Keep Things in Perspective	8	United States	Whatever else it may be, The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolans follow up to his Batman Begins, the film that resurrected the Batman franchise, is the most ambitious superhero film ever made. Its full of brooding ruminations about the inherent nature of humanity, obviously fueled by the troubled state of a post-9/11 world, and it packs an awful lot of plot into its two-and-a-half-hour running time. However, be cautioned, and dont let its #1 rating at IMDb set up expectations that the film cant possibly meet. I doubt any experienced film goer is truly going to think that this is the best film ever made.The praise heaped on Heath Ledger for his performance as the Joker is well deserved. Indeed, the Joker becomes the focus of this movie, which may not be such a desirable thing, given that this is...you know....a Batman movie. The caped crusader fades into the background in this installment, to the point where you might leave the movie and forget that he was in it. Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays the love interest, and who, true to the superhero movie formula, gets practically nothing to do. But Ledger you WILL remember. He creates a fascinating character in the Joker, and its through him that the movie poses all of its major moral questions. Is it human nature, as the Joker suggests, to devolve into chaos when the illusion of order is taken away; or do humans have an inherent kindness that will cause them to look out for one another even when circumstances seem to call for self preservation? One of the most fascinating things about Ledgers creation is that the Joker has no more motive as a criminal than to pose questions like this. Hes not out for money or even power -- he just wants to create anarchy and see what happens.I was not prepared for the other villain the screenplay throws into the mix: Two Face, played well by Aaron Eckhart. The film is too long, and its this storyline that makes it so. Chrisotpher Nolan and his brother, Jonathan, the co-writers of the film, would have done well to leave this plot line out. By the end of the film, there are too many characters doing too many things independently of one another, so that the film loses focus slightly.The movie looks fantastic though, and the production team does wonders with Chicago (where I live by the way). In fact the look of the film is one of its major selling points, and I was pleased to finally see a superhero film that looks cinematic rather than cartoonish.So...an excellent addition to the superhero genre and a completely entertaining experience....but its still, after all, a Batman movie, and its not the best film since Citizen Kane. Grade: A 
Did you people see the same film I saw?	6	United Kingdom	Do you REALLY think this was a better film than the Godfather? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? The Seven Samurai, Pulp Fiction? OK, the Joker was a stand out performance, and the rest were good, but was this really the best film of all time? Cant see how that happened, and in 30 years this will sink to the middle of the pile where it should be.You want an examination of good and evil and the duality of man? Watch the King of New York. Its a better film than this. Im not saying its not worth seeing, but please, this is NOT the best film of all time.....This may be the best Batman film weve seen, but frankly I enjoyed Iron Man more. The action was good, the story reasonable, and there were some good supporting acts, but the whole experience doesnt move you like the Shawshank redemption, it wasnt a seismic shift in film-making like Pulp Fiction or the Godfather. The direction - better than Sergio Leone? The film hasnt been hyped that much, so where is this coming from? 
This movie was a joke...	1	Calgary, Canada	Cmon folks, you call this movie a masterpiece? The greatest movie of all-time? Sheesh, I thought people had higher standards than this.The only reason why people went to see this movie is because it was Heath Ledgers last performance. And boy, does he deliver! But is it really worthy of an Oscar? Well, that depends on how you interpret The Joker.To be fair, there is no right way to interpret The Joker. His past is just as mysterious as his motivation. But how can you create a character with absolutely no history and expect him to be believable? In the comics, his name was Jack Napier, a thug/ comedian who fell into a bath of chemicals that bleached his skin as white as snow. He had only one motivation for all the mayham he caused -- to amuse himself. This back story, that Ive just given you, makes the villain far more credible than he was in the film. Even Charles Manson, one of the greatest killers of all- time, had a motivation for killing that made sense to him, but in this film we are never given any insight as to what this might be.Okay, so I have no problem with Heath Ledger winning an Oscar here. Then why did this movie suck? Because it was created for shock value instead of for entertainment. This movie has no plot. The Joker wrecks havoc on Gotham, is pretty much the only storyline you get. There are cars blowing up, people blowing up, people screaming blue murder and other bits of mayhem that make as much a sense as people screaming for mercy in a Godzilla film. Did Batman really have to fly all the way to Hong Kong to capture a corrupt banker or was that a ploy from the Chinese government to showcase the area for the 2008 Olympics? Why cant Christian Bale fight after all this time? Do you think those people on the boat would have talked things out in a civilized manner with the bombs about to explode? Me thinks pandemonium would have ensued, and that in the real world they would have dead in 10 seconds flat. Can you really set 30 million cell phones off to find one person? I think the writers wrote themselves into a corner on that one.Another thing that bugs me about this film is Two-face. The movie doesnt give lip-service to his love for duality at all. He just wakes up and goes Gee, I have a burnt face. May as well use it for scaring kids, and runs off plugging people, serving up his own brand of justice. To say that he was a hero was laughable, as people serve up their own brand of justice all the time. All you need to do is walk down the wrong alley at the wrong time to see what I mean.Overall, this film was terrible. Christian Nolans vision of creating a modern Batman kills the whimsical charm and poetic lyricism established in the earlier movies directed by Tim Burton. Besides, Danny Elfmans theme will always be the defining music of the Dark Knight. By the way, what ever happened to the Bat Cave? They should never have taken that out. 
great but doesnt deserve to be compared with masterpieces	7	United States	Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who dont mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks... 
Undescribable Perfection	10	Israel	Lets open this review with the fact that Batman is THE BEST superhero ever, with no other even coming close to his levels. So when a sequel is made for an unforgettable movie like Batman Begins expectations are EXTREMELY high. I think that if you could describe this movie in a few words it would be 152 minutes of pure awesomeness. Christopher Nolan probably created the best ever comic book adaptation of a movie. The movie itself has been adapted in a much more realistic fashion than the comic book series. First of all this movie is PERFECT for people who like punches, drama, shooting and explosions. The movie has a complicated plot that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. Its anything BUT corny, since a few important characters die, and the ending isnt happy, but its flawless. Christian Bale has proved himself one again as an amazing actor. Michael Cane (portrays Alfred Pennyworth) makes you fall in love with Batmans loyal butler. Now anyone that has seen the movie and is reading this review is probably wondering why I havent mentioned the main reason why this movie is flawless. And yes, there is ONE main reason: Heath Ledger. Heath Ledger portrayed Batmans arch nemesis in this movie: the Joker. Now anyone who has a clue in comic books knows that the Joker is INCREDIBLE. Heath Ledgers acting in this movie has turned the Joker into a LEGEND. I have never seen such perfect and realistic acting than the portrayal of the Joker in this movie. The Joker is portrayed in a much more mature fashion than the comic books, and thats why it was so good. Its simply impossible to describe him: hes bold, insane, smart, twisted and hes so awesome in this film that at some points you love him even more than Batman. If I havent mentioned it by now, this is without a doubt the best movie I have seen.Those who come with high expectations after seeing Batman Begins will not be disappointed. I advise that no one under the age of 11 watches this movie as Two-Faces appearance is rather frightening and the film contains intense action. 
Christopher Nolan masterpiece	10	None	This is one of the movies of all time. Theres action beyond belief and humor that breaks down the tension that really works. There also enough emotion to round out the experience. The joker is one of the best characters of all time. Hes truly amazing. R.I.P Mr. Heath ledger. Christian bale is of course one of the best actors ever. Its truly a gift to watch them on screen. See this movie it will make you a better person.The ending is perfect and amazing. Every time I watch it pick up something new. There was a lot of effort put into this. Better than batman begins but not as good as inception. Its actually surprisingly under rated. 
Wonderful. How superhero movies should be made!	10	Australia	Quite simply Dark Knight is the best superhero movie ever made (ok, KickAss is the only competitor, but strictly speaking, it isnt a proper superhero movie, so lets forget about that).Batman is tough, Batman is loved, Batman is weak, Batman is hated. Batman has human characteristics. Batmans enemies have human characteristics. This is the first and main reason Dark Knight succeeds. It isnt just a superhero movie. Its also a study of character, of good and of dark and of perception of society. I mean, it does this so well I sometimes think the superhero content is just a scapegoat for the deeper thought in the movie even though I know at the same that its not. Secondly, Batman doesnt do anything too unbelievable. Look at Superman, hes flying. Look at Spiderman, hes got webs coming out of his palms. Look at the Hulk he can get MASSIVE when he is angry. Thats all cool and entertaining, but Batman is, imo, the superhero whom we can connect to the closest, because he doesnt have these abilities about him which are soooo unrealistic. So, both his inner and outer character are human like which makes the movie so much more enjoyable. The action? The action in Dark Knight is amazing! Batmans car is amazing! The special effects are amazing! It is a phenomenal piece of work crafting a movie where it looks and feels fantastic!I wont talk much about Heath Ledgers portrayal of the joker. Its definitely his best performance ever, and what better time to have it just before his death, peace be upon him. I hate a ball watching the guy act. Hes just created an insanely unique persona. I loved it!Everything in Dark Knight works. Its got so much novelty to it. Its a rare piece of cinema where prima facie its for kids, but ultimately, adults will end up enjoying it much more. Dark Knight isnt for kids anyway, they wont be able to comprehend the bigger picture in Dark Knight, which is what makes this movie so special. Its cool Its original Its awesomeI cant believe how it wasnt nominated for a Best Picture. Oscars were probably too stunned at how good a super hero movie could be. Did I mention I also love Gary Oldman, the guy plays a different person in every movie, I can never tell its him 
I was disappointed by Batman Begins, was expecting the worst, and i got the best.	10	Hungary	First of all things i should say i am a comic-book fan. From Eastern Europe. Why is this important? Because here its something really different then in the USA. In the USA comic-books are part of the everyday life. Here it is not. Here it is an underrated genre, and most of the people still think it is something sissy for small children and contains only fighting and dialogue no higher level then Kapow and Boom-Boom. And it was even worse when i was little. It was always a little treasure hunt to get some. And most of them was bad rip-off, cheap junk from the above mentioned category, and it was only Batman, who continually represented quality and was available for a kid like me too. And i was amused and loved it. Not Batman in the first place, but the amazing villains. And especially Joker. He was the best of the best. Maybe the most complex, interesting and remarkable character ever created.And to tell the truth, i wasnt entirely satisfied with either one of the Batman films made up to the Dark Knight. Especially considering that there was an absolutely brilliant animated series: Batman the Animated Series, check it out if you like Batman, well worth it. They first 3 movies were okay, but the Batman and Robin and Batman Begins both sucked big time, but for different reasons. I lost hope i will ever see a really good and faithful adaptation of this comic. Then along came this one.Yes it has some overdone parts, some flaws here and there, a bit rushed and corny ending, but its good, meaningful, and Heath Ledger (who i disliked before i saw this) is the absolutely perfect Joker. When i saw the casting, i thought it is a disgrace. After i saw the movie i thought he was unearthly good. The film has suspense, great acting, emotions, and a very interesting and coherent plot which is very rare in Hollywood blockbusters. Well worth watching for anyone and everyone. Especially for people, who think comic-books are sissy things for little children... 
The best Batman film yet.	10	United Kingdom	One couldnt help be sceptical of the hype surrounding The Dark Knight before having seen it, scepticism was certainly weighing on my mind as i walked into the cinema. I couldnt help thinking is this going to be as amazing as expected, or is the hype just an inevitable reaction to the death of Heath Ledger? I can safely say to anyone still having not seen The Dark Knight; the hype wouldve been just as massive even if Ledger hadnt tragically overdosed during filming, The film is mind-blowingly amazing! The action sequences, The dialogue, the editing, the lighting, the costume, the score, the cinematography, The Ledger, The Bale, The Eckhart, The Freeman, The every-single-tiny-bit of cinema... is brilliant.Theres not the slightest whiff of the child-friendly-cinema that tore Tim Burtons vision apart all those (not many) years ago. Eckharts Dent/Two-Face, blows Tommy Lee Jones out of the metaphorical water, the only shame is that his performance will be overshadowed by Ledgers even better one, and indeed his tragic demise.Every insane laugh from Ledgers lips echoes with excellence, Jack Nicholson should be very very very proud. However, Ledgers delivery, commitment, presence and dress-wearing-ability far surpass the realms of merely paying homage to Nicholsons Joker. Nolan and Ledger really show Burton and Nicholson just how darkly immense the joker can be.Not to forget Bale, who brings his portrayal of Batman (and the barking voice it brings) to the next level, the depth and inner conflict create an excellent empathy effect on the audience and also create ridiculously good viewing.I could go on all day, going into every actors success, about how immense The Dark Knight is... but i think you probably get the message by now.As undoubtedly one of the most difficult films to bring to the public, a film so swamped with hype, tragedy, death and scandal; The Dark Knight could easily have been written off with the tragic death of Heath Ledger, we should thank God that it wasnt. 
Bat-A-Man!	10	India	There is just one thing that differentiates a legend from ordinary man. Its his fight with inner demons to over come all his fear. That defines a legend. And this is what Batman stands for. Batman is not just another comic character but its a complete saga of how you stand tall in spite of losing everything, walk fearlessly even when you are lonely and how you fight back against all odds and over shadow your own fear. Fear- the most dominated emotion, mankind has ever witnessed. Batman is no exception, he still has fear, he still gets scared of losing those who are close to him and he is still in doubts when it comes to decision. But what is interesting and inspirational about Batman is that he has the ability to use wisely the biggest and most dangerous weapons of all time perfectly- BRAIN! Thats why he is my favourite comic character and this time, Batman is putting everything on the line to save the world from out of control freak- the Joker.A spell bounded performance by Heath Ledger as the Joker. Though, he is no more with us but his immortal act as joker is an Oscar winning performance and will always be remembered. Your heart comes out to mouth to see the horror Joker creates. In start, I was bit confused as his performance reminded me of Jack Nicholson from the first Batman movie but later, I realised that this is for real. He did not imitate Jack but showcased the true and horrible side of a real joker. The best part about Heath is that he displayed the flip side of a joker- FEARLESS. There are many times when we feel that some one could have done better with certain roles but not here. Here, Heath is perfect as a joker and from now on, I will call him Heath Joker Ledger!The story is about a terror that has shaken the underworld of Gotham. The fear of Batman is getting in to criminal minds and all of them are now thinking where their money can be saved from Batmans reach. And thats where the Joker comes with a plan to these criminals- kill Batman. Now with his perverted mind, the Joker is behind Batmans life and what follows is a scary hell of a ride of hide n seek game of faith vs. courage. At one end, Joker has no fear and on the other, Batman has a responsibility of saving Gotham. Now the important question is that who will win and more than that at what cost?Apart from breaking box office records, this movie is also able to break the pattern of film making. Batman series is an action series. When you make an action movie you give the required pace in a movie by focusing on elaborating the action scenes but here, the director builds the movie with a mix of action as well as other emotional scenes. Step by step movie gives its audience action and emotion at the time when its required but with an unexpected style. Dark, intense and a complete Batman style. The Batman movies are famous for its back ground music and The Dark Knight is no exception. Specially, when there is sound of a whistle in background of some intense scenes in the movie. I felt a rush in to my blood and boiling my brain. My eyes popped out while watching those scenes. To mention, Batmans grilling session with the Joker is a masterpiece. The scene was simply awesome mainly coz of background music. Harvey Dents character could have been better post he becomes 2-faced. I was expecting his character to be more involved and longer in the series. Rachel Dawes is also a very strong influencing character in the movie. Her involvement in the movie is much focused than Katie Holmes in Batman Begins but the point Im making here is the glam factor in this movie. She was not given that much footage in a glamorous way. Nevertheless, the plot did not allow audience to think that way either. Action scenes in this movie are well thought of and will chill the audiences spinal chords. My favourite is the chase scene where Joker is trying best to catch Harvey Dent and how Batman comes in between. This is where Batman says asta la vista and welcomes his new girl friend- his damn new bike! Its called Batpod! I can imagine how excited you will be when you know that Batman is now going to catch the Joker and Joker is happy that Batman has missed his shot. This is sheer delight to watch the creative involvement of special effects blended with brilliant cinematography. Unlike other Hollywood flicks, The Dark Knight is a lengthy movie of more than 2 &frac12; hrs of non-stop adrenaline but you wont mind spending that much time watching it. Many times we feel that some movies couldve been shorter and some lengthier but with The Dark Knight thats not the case. Its mainly because the movie ends up at the time when it is required to scroll the curtains down. I was so satisfied while coming out from the movie hall. Perfect ending!Well, The Dark Knight is just a beginning. Now Im expecting the Penguin and the Riddler to come in to the picture and take this battle ahead. As I said earlier, Im a big fan of Batman and after this movie, Im mad about not just Batman, but each and every part of his movies, music and, The Joker!. Now, while Im rushing straight to the nearest movie store to buy all original movies and soundtracks of Batman series, you go ahead and enjoy a fearless life just like the Joker or Batman- choice is yours! 
Takes itself way too seriously	1	United States	Indulge me for a second here. Imagine that youre a studio executive, and someone is pitching the movie to you. And heres what he says: All right. My movies based on old comic books and is set in a fictional city. In it, theres going to be a rich guy who goes around fighting crime while dressed like a bat because his parents died. And then theres going to be this other guy who, for no given reason, dresses up like a clown, acts creepy, and goes around killing people. The bat dressing person is going to go around trying to defeat him by beating people up with his bare hands. Meanwhile, theres this other guy whos a perfectly nice lawyer, but then his face gets burned, so he decides to kill people based on this random coin that he has. It sounds kind of funny and interesting to you, but just as youre accepting it, the person suddenly coughs under his breath, Oh yeah. And Im going to take it seriously like it was Shakespeare and make it so depressing that it actively hurts the audience. Im not sure if thats exactly how the meeting proposing this movie went, but it seems to be a reasonable guess. Lets face it. The whole story of this movie is patently ridiculous. It could not be more unrealistic if there were space aliens involved. And yet, its still treated here as if we should be taking it as a serious parable of modern life, and that it should be used as a way to push really depressing messages across. How does a guy who beats people up while in a bat suit teach us about what kind of justice is realistic and effective? What does a weirdo in a clown suit teach us about the nature of evil? Why would anyone be proud that they kept campiness out of this despite the fact that it is a campy movie? Give me the days of Adam West. At least his show made me happy rather than depressed. 
Just so...so bad	1	United States	It is inconceivable that this movie is anywhere near the Top 250. It is 2.5 hours of a coarse voice, explosions, cheap one liners, and terrible plot.Batman Begins, I thought was brilliant. It had genuine pathos, its characters were very believable and had depth to them. The acting was phenomenal.But this piece of crap, is completely the opposite. I have seen spaghetti westerns and childrens cartoons with better acting then The Dark Knight. With the exception of the Joker, by Ledger, who was decent.There is no screenplay. There are explosions. I think Michael Bay actually produced and directed this.There is a random side plot to Hong Kong that had no purpose or place in the story. The cell phone tracking technology is the dumbest and most far fetched thing I have ever seen in a film.The only reason this movie gets any recognition or praise is because of Ledgers death. That plus the Batman and Joker fanboys that flood IMDb to give this crap a 10. They like how cool Joker was, and sided with him, and they feel bad for Ledger. A + B = in top 10 of IMDb.This movie is completely forgettable and deserves no awards and none of your time. It DOES deserve to be an example of a horrendously written, poorly shot, poorly lit, pathetic excuse of a movie. 
A Plot in the Dark	1	United States	Why did I watch this movie? To observe the performance of the late Heath Ledger. It was not a disappointment but, like other reviewers, I think it was not one in a league with, say, John Huston in Chinatown or Bogart in The Treasure of Sierra Madre. It was more akin to Edward G. Robinson in Key Largo, not shabby, entertaining in a movie which is really not memorable at all. The noise of it would have been unbearable in a movie theater but I saw it at home and could control the sound level and fast-forward. Ive only seen a handful of movies that shouldnt have been over in ninety minutes and this one really didnt even have that much content. The dialog seemed to have been pieced together from the dead bodies of older scripts. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman grace any film by their acting abilities but I kept waiting for Christian Bale to say, Go on. Make my day. Monique Curnan was notable in her supporting role. The rest of the major players seemed to be phoning it in. 
Am i the only one who thinks........Average?	1	Australia	OK now i was a big fan of Batman Begins, i really liked it but it wasnt really my favourite movie ever and the same can be said for The Dark Knight.First of all, whilst the joker was an interesting character and very well written, to be honest i dont see what everyone is raving about. Yes Heath was amazing, but it gets me thinking was this due to the script? Or heaths ability to understand and become a phycopath? If it really is the second, should we applaud it?Did it live up too all the Hype? Is Heath the only reason people went to see it? Is it the best film of the year? The answer to all these is of course..........no, and i dont understand why everyone is treating it like a god omg it was so amazing, best movie of the year, you see people this type of person is called a Hype Hound(by the way, thats copy written =]), a person who bases there sole judgement on the hype surrounding a film, and the first few reviews. Thats not to say there arent some true fans who really did love the movie, but Im sick of the pretenders giving it tens when they didnt even like it Conformity is for those who cant think of there own free will, free will is for those who break through conformityAnyways guys my final words is, a great movie but not the greatest. Will Heath win an Oscar? Yes. Will it win Best Picture? Well lets just see 
Not as good as most people would have you believe	6	United Kingdom	The Dark Knight is an intensely powerful, dramatic and compelling film, but despite that Im not sure I really enjoyed it a great deal. I saw it on the huge IMAX screen in London, which has an ability to almost suck you into the action and make you feel a part of the film, but at the same time various aspects of the film meant that I felt alienated from the characters and the plot. Who is Batman, and what do we really know about him? After having watched the whole film (all 2.5 hours of it), Im not sure I could say. What are his motives? Does he really love Rachel - indeed does he have the capacity to love at all? Again, hints are given, but the central character is so poorly developed that it makes it hard to really care about what happens to him or those around him. My inability to empathise with the characters wasnt helped by the ridiculous number of sub-plots, most of which are rushed or incomplete, and the relentless pace at which the film moves from one to the other. The film would have been so much better if it had stuck to a simpler storyline, and developed the characters and themes within that.The frenzied sequence of largely unrelated action set-pieces, whilst initially breathtaking, ended up feeling dull and predictable. What was lacking in between the explosions was anything resembling meaningful dialogue. A few mumbled words from Batman and some inane musings from the Joker werent enough to keep the film going.As such, I left the film feeling somewhat exhausted at the bleak, joyless, violent world I had witnessed, and disappointed that this much-hyped film just hadnt been as good as I was hoping it would be. 
A Testament to the Stupidity of Our Times	1	Canada	Although suffering from a muddled plot, ill-defined characters, a typically uncharismatic performance by Christian Bale, and a lack of energy, The Dark Knight proved to be on of 2008s greatest commercial and critical successes.The fact that this film is in the Top Ten list tells me two things: 1) Most of the people who rated this highly are either 10-year-olds or adults with the attention span of 10-year-olds. I do not mean to offend all 10-year-olds, because there are some rare exceptions. But, you can catch my drift.2) People who rated this highly have not seen many of the other, better films on this list. They have nothing to compare The Dark Knight to.Anyway, I just hope this films current standing sinks down far below the 250 mark. 
No worth the money	1	United States	My comments refer only to the 2008 USA release, aspect ratio 2.35 : 1 widescreen version (not the IMAX aspect ration 1.44 : 1, which could potentially be better)Sorry but the movie was AWFUL, Not worth the money! Special effects aside, gadgets, and the Batmobile which is a dream automobile, the movie runs 152 minutes too long, unnecessary ending, but most importantly does not have any resemblance to the original Batman series or the comic books, neither in character, nor intent.Best of the movie is the director Christopher Nolan,his attention to detail and superb sequences,i.e: bus braking out of the bank, the capture and return of Lau (Chin Han), the explosion, and the capture of the Joker (Heath Ledger). The characters are very intense, especially The Joker, Bruce Wayne/Batman, & Harvey Dent/Two-Face. The best and worst of the actors, Ill start with the worse. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine both accomplished actors they are probably two of the finest alive, Sir Caine was the worst of the supporting characters, neither of the two were convincing, they failed in their craft both were consistently bad actors in this film. The best was Heath Ledger hands down, his performance was top-notch, consistent, but above all spectacular. There will be a sequel to Batman: The Dark Knight which sincerely hope will be better. 
Not even the best movie of 2008.	2	United States	To start, I would like to say that this movie is not even as good as Batman Begins. Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors, Batman is one of the best super heroes, but that still does not mean this equates to The Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather.This is a very good movie, but it is not deserving of all of the hype surrounding it. Health Ledgers death had more of an impact on this movies critical acclaim than anything in the actual movie. The Joker is pretty cool because the screen writers made him cool, not because Health Ledger delivered an Oscar worthy performance or any of that other BS. People seem to forget that Liam Neeson played his character in Begins at least as well if not better than Heath Ledger played The Joker. Also, Christian Bale is predominately playing his snobby Bruce Wayne character in this film, which is quite annoying. After seeing the movie, you might even realize that Christian Bales obscure placement throughout the film is a major flaw.The Godfather is around 3 hours, this is around 2&1/2 hours, yet this movie feels much slower. Rather than keeping a steady pace, the movie seems to doze off for a while followed by huge explosions and overly drawn out 30 minute action sequences. Its ridiculous.The best movie of 2008 is In Bruges, not TDK. 
all you need to know is......	1	Texas	I saw this movie on a Monday afternoon in hopes of avoiding a long wait and big crowds at the theater. Good plan. It worked. The movie didnt. Many reviewers have already commented on the gross mediocrity of this film so Ill skip that part. There were some very good, though isolated, moments in the story: a lesson about how torture is wrong and doesnt work, the equal value of all lives regardless of how they have been lived, abridged civil rights are neither civil nor right, etc. I like all those concepts and they are certainly worthy of exploration given our current political state.To me, however, the most prominent feature of this film was neither Heath Ledger, (whom I greatly respect as an actor), Christian Bale, nor the script, directing, story line, performances, or suspense, but rather the gorrific violence that punctuated almost every moment of the more than two and a half hours this thing went on. Everything in this movie explodes!!! And the cut aways in the editing do nothing to mitigate the impact of all the slashing, stabbing, pounding, bludgeoning, shooting, and impaling that becomes ridiculous about halfway through. And though I have enormous respect for him, Ledgers Joker was basically Ted Bundy with face paint. I think the inspiration for this film came more from Oliver Stones Natuarl Born Killers than from anything that was ever written in a comic book.All you need to know is this... In the last ten minutes of the film, with the body count hovering somewhere around 100, a scene begins to unfold where a young child is about to be murdered in cold blood, (those of you who have seen the movie know what Im talking about). The scene goes on for what I thought was an excruciatingly long time, but even as it was just beginning I was thinking to myself, no, no, no, this is wrong. This should not be done this way in a movie. Then somewhere in the theater, behind me, a child began sobbing uncontrollably. Yes, real terror, real horror, real fear, a real child, right there in the theater. The scene finally came to an end. The sobbing didnt. As the lights came up for us to leave I saw a couple escorting their approximately 12 year old son out of the theater, still sobbing, and hanging on to his parents clothing as they walked out.I dont blame the parents. This movies PG13 rating is unconscionable. This is a Batman movie! With a PG13 rating! Batman originated from a childrens comic book series. One would think that this movie would be a safe experience for children. Its not. Given the grotesque thread of constant violence that runs from the opening credits to the closing credits its not even suitable for adults. Several of the postings here at IMDb with the lowest ratings have noted that they are putting their rating as low as possible to balance out the overly generous perfect scores that have vaulted this movie into the position of being one of the greatest film ever,according to IMDb. Not me. I really didnt like this movie. And in the last ten minutes of it I came to hate it. It does not do service to the Batman franchise, or movies in general. There is not a shred of comic book appeal in it anywhere, and it will take its place as one of the most uselessly violent movies ever made. That this offering has the broad appeal it has makes me a little sad, and sick inside. And if I could speak for the poor kid that was sitting behind me during this bloated gore fest Id say this, thanks for the memories. 
The Age of Commercialism	1	None	There is not really any reasonable explanation why there are so many junk movies with ratings over 8 in IMDb except the fact that unfortunately we are living in the age of materialism and total commercialism. Before mentioning anything about The Dark Knight itself I should point out that the movie business started as an experiment and furthermore, it was (and I hope it still is) art. If you are a part of the lucky people that had the chance to watch old movies (starting from the early 1900s) then you probably have noticed that despite the bad quality the technique and the style of directing, cinematography, acting and special effects are fascinating. They are modern, sincere, effective, touching. Thats where art starts and flourishes. However, if you take all the pointed out and replace them with high quality computer effects, deafening soundtrack, good looking actors, banal plot and the appealing to the masses simple conflict of Good vs Bad; well, here is where commercialism begins its unstoppable brainwashing system. The Dark Knight fits exactly the formula. Nothing more to say. To those who agree: There are still some great new movies coming out. It just takes time to find them. Dont be discouraged by the overwhelming amount of junk films. To those who disagree: Well, consider watching Casablanca, Silence of the Lambs, Amadeus, Star Wars :p, etc? To those who dont take a side: Now is the time to do so. To Heath Ledger: You were just great and sorry to know this was the last time to see you. [17 June 2009]Later ... Here now as I watched the film for a second time so that I would be entirely fair in my judgment I realized that 8/10 is a fair rating BUT and only BUT when The Dark Knight is rated on a different scale such as Top movies based on a comics. And what is a comics other than a combination of a simple plot, good vs evil, black and white characters, lots of action? The end. When a movie has nothing more to add - no fair character development/acting, no original twists in the chain of events, no unique directing techniques... then one cannot give it more than 5/10. And since the IMDb has a great image the only way users can help keeping it safe and sound is by taking a little more seriously their voting rights. [30 June 2009] 
When they said Dark did they mean a coal mine at night	1	United States	I just rented this from Netflix and forced myself to watch it till the end. What a dreadful, boring yet expensive movie. It was so dimly lit, they could have had any of the thousands of out-of-work actors in Southern California in it with no perceptible difference. I guess a couple more explosions would have helped (not really). I only watched it cause of Heath Ledgers excellent performance in Brokeback Mountain. Boy, was I disappointed. I didnt care about anyone while watching except for myself who was waiting for it to end. At times the dialog was difficult to understand with the volume way up but the loud soundtrack made every sound effect rattle the furniture.I just dont get what passes for great entertainment nowadays. I had to watch some old Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons afterward as an intelligent antidote to this cartoonish movie that tries for so much significance, an odd combination. Its like looking for significance and the meaning of life in an infomercial. Dont bother. 
Hyped and a little overrated, this is a good film but with many flaws	1	Netherlands	I think the hype around this movie makes people completely overrate it. OK Heath does a great job at the joker but the movie itself has many flaws: 1. The balance between good and badguy is all out of sync. Batman fades into the background, he also has way less dialog than the joker. This makes the movie unbalanced. I think they re-cut the movie after Heaths death, to put him in the foreground.2. The movie is tooooo long, this story can be shorter with less redundant scenes, its like they couldnt choose what to put in, so they just put all of it in! This gave me and some of my friends several *yawn* moments near the end.3. Gotham city looks like a normal city. In batman begins it had a real comic feel but in this movie it doesnt, which is a shame really.4. The point of the movie, (i wont tell u what it is) but yes, this action movie tries to make a philosophical point. Of course this can be great, but in this movie it gets chewed over and over and over and then it gets forced down your throat.5. Lack of humor. An occasional sharp or funny dialog would have been great, however the dialogs arnt very good and theyre never funny.6. The plot devices are really quite lame. I wont go into details but most of the plot devices are silly and inspirationless, even the comic manages to feel more realistic than that. Somehow the movie doesnt manage to convince the audience of its own logic, probably cause there is none.All in all its a fun movie, with great performance by Heath as the joker, however it is not the masterpiece people try to turn it into. It doesnt deserve a place in the top 250, and it is not the best movie of 2008. Of course, if you settle for mediocrity this is the movie for you! 
Why so much hype?	1	None	Okay, so they built a good villain in the Joker, but the plot was just a bit too unbelievable to hold together. Im not going to add any spoilers here, but if you want a big-budget, action- adventure escape that totally relies on the rendering farms that had to handle all the special effects... and dont mind plot-holes the Hindenburg could fly through, this film is for you. IMHO, this film doesnt deserve all the hype. Look at reviews from people who hated it and see why. Once the hype has died down and people get over their brainwash to overrate this over-produced Hollywood crap, we should see ratings more in line with the films true value. I didnt walk out, but that was because I had such high expectations. Id hope to see this rated a 4, maybe even as high as a 6 by the average public. Im rating this a 1 to try to offset the obvious shills and excessive hype. This is, by no means, the best film of the summer... but in its favor, it does give better balance to the darkness of Batman. If it werent for the growing trend in bucking the old feel-good Hollywood ending routine... if it werent becoming clich&eacute; to kill off good guys and create characters with seeming hearts of gold, who turn half-evil, Id say this film had something unique; but that whole scenario is now a formula for making a film armchair critics will say has depth... pffff... Save your time and money and rent an old classic favorite that you somehow never managed to see. Or go have a picnic with your loved ones. The alternative is two-and-a-half hours you wont get back; dont waste it to further enrich Warner Bros. 
Hmm, the most overrated junk movie, I have seen in my whole life	3	None	This movie is a non-plot action-packed propaganda movie. Which wouldnt be so bad but the combination is such that it IS the worst movie I have ever seen in my whole life. Seriously, when I came out of the movie theatre I was sick and angry at the same time. The whole movie is about approach towards the various kinds of villains, how they are and how they should be generally handled. You have about twenty propaganda lines, towards which each part of the film leads, those parts connected by a very feeble link. You could almost see the authors as they thought, hmm, we need to put this line into the movie, what circumstances will lead the hero or antihero to tell the audience this truth? Of course that made the movie a two hour drag where the twists and turns of fortune made you think if it wasnt a 10yr old child who wrote it. Ha, the setup worked we caught the Joker. Oh, Joker escaped, what are we gonna do? Then the good guys would realize that Joker wanted them to set up a trap, he wanted to be caught so as to get ..., escape and harm even more. Well, that is so childishly ridiculous, first surrealistic propaganda movie ever. So guys out there in the US remember. When you get spied through your cell phones, when your dear ones die in stead of a rich undercover agent, dont feel offended. Because to fight the crime or terrorism, we dont need the good heroes (those apparently end up as dead half-faced wackos). We need dark knights. Sorry for my bad English. I needed to get this off my chest. So much approval, 9.2 user rating here, 94% on rottentomatoes, are that many people so simple or so easily bought? 
Just what Iexpected - Its a self-parody	1	Hungary	This movie has proved again, that cartoon means junk, and whatever you do starting from a cartoon, it will still be junk. At least now someone else in Hollywood realized this, and made a real good parody of the cartoon genre. An extra joke is, that all this was masked as a serious superhero cartoon movie. Just some of the best hidden jokes Ive found behind the clich&eacute; story:1. Batman kills at least a dozen of cops during the car chase, and makes some million $ worth of damage in the road, buildings. etc., but he is still the good guy. Sure.2. All the citizens in Gotham are totally stupid. First of all, they dont realize, that the only person, who has enough money to buy those hi-tech gadgets is Bruce Wayne, and nobody realizes, who Batman is. Second, it doesnt matter, that Batmans mask is covering only a small part of his face (his forehead and nose), they still dont realize, who is hiding behind the mask By the way, did you notice, that there is a face recognition software running on one of the monitors in Batmans hideout? The very same happened in the previous Batman franchise - looks like folks in Gotham didnt get any smarter in the past decades.3. Looking at the height of the pile, I guess that the amount of cash Joker is burning is more than there is in circulation in the whole world.4. All the mobs are stupid enough to keep their money in cash, so if they want to make a transfer, they have to hire a dozens of trucks. They havent ever heard about electronic money. If they are so stupid, then how they can run a syndicate?5. Some billion worth of hi-tech gadgets is hiding in the basement of Wayne company. For years in nobodys mind turned up the idea to find a customer and make some money of it. They just wasted some million $ into it, and later they decided to hide it.6. The way the bat car and the bat bike moves is totally unrealistic. Also, such vehicles would be totally unpractical. For example, why are the wheels of the bat car in the front of the vehicle? Anyone can shot it with a simple pistol (these are rubber wheels), and game is over. The stupid design of the vehicle is proved in one scene, when Joker immobilizes the car (supposedly worths some million$ + the development costs, as this is a prototype) with a common RPG, which costs only a handful of dollars.7. When they bring down the chopper with the steel cables, the two guys must have know in advance, that exactly where (which street and what height) the chopper will go through. Keep in mind, that according to the plot, all these Joker sidekicks are mentally retarded people. And doesnt matter, that the chase is half a dozen mile long, they are just in the exact time at the exact place.8. Hey terrorists and wannabe terrorists! I have some good news for you! It looks like, that if you want to kill a major, then all you have to do is to get an uniform. (An uniform can be bought in any costume shop, you dont even have to beat policemen and take away from them like in the movie.) Then you can approach the major to point blank distance - the only problem is, that there are oracles in the police, too, who can predict the future, and jump between you and the major even before you pull the trigger.9. Blowing a building is an easy process. High explosives are strange artifacts, as you can move and properly plant hundred kilos within a couple of minutes into the designated places of a building. Also, when you blow up a building, you can stay 10 meters away from it, and you will suffer no damage from debris, rubble and/or air pressure.10. Ship crews are incredibly dumb. They cant realize that there are hundreds of gasoline in the engine room. Or even if they have found it, then they may have thought, that the captain is going to throw a surprise party for the whole crew, and in the barrels there is the stuff necessary for such party (vaseline).These are just some quick random things I can remember, I dont want to waste much time commenting this disaster. Lets not talk about obvious plot holes, pointless violence, superfluous subplots, and Bale acting like a wood - oh my god, why that deep voice when dressed as Batman? 
TDK, a solid superhero movie, nothing more	7	Netherlands	After reading quite a few reviews from the states i was very curious about this movie. As a kid i loved to read superhero comic books, spiderman and batman were my favourites. Loving the spiderman movies and also liking the first new Batman movie by Nolan and wanting to see the last performance by Heath Ledger i couldnt wait to see this movie.Man was i disappointed.Dont get me wrong, i liked the movie, i had fun with it and the performance bij Heath Ledger is something i will never forget. I was sceptical about him because people tend to exaggerate performances of popular dead actors but i must honestly admit, he blew me away. He also blew every actor away he shared screen time with, i liked gary oldman best together with him in a scene. I am still wowed by Hedgers performance, and i must admit i really feel frustrated that he is gone, this performance MUST get an Oscar.Caine was very good, Bale was OK although i dont like him as batman, he is a good Bruce Wayne but not a good batman and i really enjoyed Aaron Eckart as Harvey Dent.But i thought the movie also had quite a few flaws.Without giving away too much i really though most of the combat action scenes were not easily watchable because they were to fast to follow, I really didnt like the way they went with two face, and the ending sequence with the bat and the joker to me was a let down. Also i dont like the way Nolan tells the story but i must admit, thats a personal opinion.There were 2 surprising moments that i really loved, one containing a pencil which got me laughing very hard and the other the choice sequence which ended in a way i didnt see coming but loved it.All in all, an OK superhero movie, 7 stars but 9? come on people, thats crazy.Its unbelievable that movies like the matrix 1 , gladiator, as good as it gets, l.a. confidential, eternal sunshine and the spotless mind dont rank as high as this movie, i cant understand it although i respect it.Happy to share my feel about this movie,Realkane 
The Dark Mess	1	United Kingdom	Is this what now passes for entertainment? Can this really be compared for depth and breadth with other generally highly-rated movies such as the Godfather, Casablanca or even Star Wars? Many of the IMDb top movies deal with the good old battle between good and evil and the world-weariness of the hero or anti-hero, but this film lands far short of the mark in both character and plot development, not to mention script, acting, screenplay or any of the other attributes of a movie that might be worthy of commendation.The purity of the comic book origins of this piece are thoroughly distorted and turned into an incoherent muddle - almost any James Bond movie has a great deal more tension, humour, conviction and morality than this mess of a movie. On the other hand, if theres a serious message in The Dark Knight, I missed it, as I suspect will thousands of others. As a Batman flick, it simply doesnt deliver anything like the expectations; at yet another level as a post-9/11, human-condition, search-for-identity movie it also fails - however you want to see it, it fails on a grandiose scale.For some of who do not live in the in the US, The Dark Knight has the potential to appear as little more than an appalling piece of hyped-up propaganda for a moribund social policy that permits and legitimises evil, mayhem and general wrongdoing and unpleasantness on a colossal scale in the pursuit of defeating the threats against society.Ive had more fun at the cinema studying the architecture. 
Do you have 0 rating as well??	1	India	I dont want to waste more time on writing the review for this stupid movie, as I have already wasted my precious time watching it! This movies is over-hyped. con, IMDb gives it 9.2?? I mean are you serious?? lol........really this is the biggest joke ever, that an awful movie like this gets 9.2??!!! Direction is mediocre. The hissing voice of batman is annoying. It was supposed to sound intimidating and macho, but it sounds as if he is having laryngitis, instead.Joker?? Was he really the joker (who never laughs??). A joker is a character, who is supposed to be full of surprises and tricks, and most important the one who laughs in paradoxical situations. Unfortunately, this joker was not even close to the actual joker character.It seems, as if joker controls the whole city, but how and when, God knows? I cant go without mentioning that hyper sonar machine, that can see every single person in the city. This time the director really jumped out of his briefs!! You evacuate all the hospitals in the city, except for the person for whom you are doing the evacuation!! lol........who was the writer?? I guess he didnt reach school higher than 2nd grade.I have so much to say about this stupid movie, but again, as I have already promised that even reviewing this stupid movie is wastage of time, so in the end, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, which paradoxically gets the best rating. 
Are you people paid for rating this non-event a tener?	1	Hungary	This is the biggest ridicule after George W. not being able to spell the word nuclear right. It is simply beyond my understanding how hundreds of thousands of people could have rated this film even worthy of attention. Batman, The Dark Knight is a piece of cake. With capital letters.OK, a huge fat turkey of a movie is not a new kid on the block. But no piece of trash has ever been so over-rated as this one is. I know that Heath Ledgers death came unexpected, and the guy was a solid actor, but you cannot praise something to the skies out of commiseration and loyalty. Cause however hard I am trying I am not able to find any other substantial reason why you would give Christopher Nolans new embarrassment of an action flick six, seven, eight or nine points, let alone ten.This movie is lacking a consequent plot, a cohesion of the myriad of action scenes it has been broken down into and a common sense to know when enough is enough. Besides, I really dont know which film those who said the acting was brilliant had watched, but what I see is that Christian Bale, Maggie Gyllenhal and Gary Oldman all lack conviction and had the end of the day - and probably the collection of money - in mind when they stood in position in front of the blue screen. Oh, and quite often I really got confused; from time to time I needed to be reminded I was not watching the new James Bond movie or Terminator CXXXVIII (the gadget scene, the plane escape scene are truly pathetic, as is the concept of (re)introducing the character of Two-Face, the guy who did not read the instructions manual of the microwave oven).Since we are talking about a comic book adaptation I dont bother to mention how unrealistic action sequences are (try wiring a town hospital with all that security and CCTV cameras they got installed, or try buying - unnoticed - the oil reserves of a medium sized country to blow half of the city into the sky), but let me ask why nobody out of the immense crew that put this film together could pay attention to small details. Like when police forces storm the Hong Kong building to catch the bat-suit guy: Arigato, arigato!- they wave each other up the stairs. Does this mean China needs to hire law enforcement personnel from Japan? OK, I am stopping there. I know I might already have made some enemies among comic book and action film lovers. This forgettable encounter with Batman however, reminds me again I am not one of them. 
Seriously? SPOILER	1	Canada	OK I waited a really long time to actually see this movie.. mostly because of the hype.. I wanted to see if after all the long drawn out hype of Heath Ledgers death... its #1 spot on the IMDb boards.. and all the back and forth conversations on whether it or not it was the greatest film of all time... it could actually live up to that standing.The simple answer is no.1. Writing 6/10There are a lot of points in this film where the dialogue feels really rushed and just awkward. I dont understand why batman begins (which in my opinion far exceeds this film) could do everything right with the screenplay and this one fail so badly. The standard plot devices are there good/evil good as evil.. downfall of the hero.. redemption .. blah blah blah... its all been done before.. and I might add done much better. One quick film which comes to mind.. There will be blood used a very similar thesis of the antihero but did in a much more intelligent and beautiful way. 2. Visuals 7/10Yes there are a lot of very impressive effects in this movie.. the tractor flipping being one.. and the whole opening sequence.. but again where have we not seen any of this before in a michael bay project or hell even the die hard movies? There is no signature to the cinematography and nothing which sets it apart from any other big budget Hollywood movie. Id say the most stand out moment of the entire thing was seeing harvey dents face after the accident.3. Characters 2/10OK if hear a Batman talk like that again I swear im going to walk out of the theatre, What a horrible horrible disaster . Christian Bale sounded like he had one of his batarangs stuck in his throat. I dont know who decided on this plot device but it was a mistake. I dont remember any of this in Batman Begins and imo it really brought the project as a whole down. Heath Ledger was OK. Whenever an actor passes away prior to the release of his film of course there will be a strong tendency to have a biased opinion to how great he was. It really felt like he was overdoing it. If he took his acting down a notch I think his vision of the joker would have been much more believable. And possibly shooed him in for an Oscar nod. About the only really believable character in the film was Gary Oldmans Jim Gordon But than again anything he does his great.4. Overall 5/10A good action movie... But seriously overrated. 007 in a Bat Costume. PS#4 currently on the IMDb top100? Someones getting paid. 
Unwatchable - only 1 sound guy?	1	Netherlands	Its not often I find a movie plain unwatchable, but that was the case with the Dark Knight. The reason is plain and simple: almost every dialog feels fake as only 1 person speaks per camera point. Like with cheap soaps where they can only take care of the sound of one person, or where the stars dont physically meet that much. The lack of chemistry and realness resulting from monologues shot in series an then cut to dialogs, is bewildering. Staggering low-quality. I honestly found it unwatchable because of that, and whats even more bewildering is that this seemingly cheap or ill-produced production is considered a master piece by so many. I feel like the little child in The Emperors New Clothes. Whats going on here? Has everyone turned blind? Shockingly bad. 
ridiculous rating	1	Netherlands	Another example of an over-hyped movie, but now in extreme. To say this piece of junk should be regarded as the best movie of 2008 is ridiculous. Basicaly it is just another movie about a man in a bat-suit who duels for more than 2 hours with another badman with a painted smile, and in the process some quasi profound remarks are exchanged. No humor in sight to make the movie better digestible.Big budget, good actors and some clever make-up artists are no guarantee for a good movie. In this case it resulted in a very boring one.As for the so-called performance of the year by Ledger; he is (was) a very good actor but this one-dimensional role is far from being special, but I guess the Oscar will be his, Nil nisi bonum.Why this movie should be on par with, or far better than true masterpieces like the Godfather 1&2 and Vertigo is beyond belief. 
Too implausible and too dark, but not terrible	1	Brussels, Belgium	For a film to be 10/10, it really has to be almost perfect. I know its all about opinions, but to get that rating it must be technically well made, you know, entertaining, good plot, special FX, acting, realism, etc. Oh and when I say realism I dont mean you cannot have superheroes or fantasy, but within the framework of the movie you have to follow its own rules. For example the Matrix was still realistic even though people could fly (it was set in a computer so its possible). I liked the fact TDK was serious and dark, but that is where the positives end. The plot is ludicrous, as the Joker, who is a human being, is omnipresent, clairvoyant, a great hypnotist, invincible and has no human needs. I know this is a comic book movie, but when you set up a film in a normal America city, with normal physics and all that goes with it, you cannot then just make up a completely implausible story of events.- The joker is beaten up, involved in car crashes, doesnt seem to sleep, yet is perfectly fine at all times- Has a vast amount of mindless, kamikaze, henchmen, who inexplicably do everything he says.- The joker is able to accurately predict where everyone in Gotham will be at any time and able to somehow be in 20 places at once.- No one notices the huge amounts of explosives placed in the hospital or the boats or any building in town for that matter. - A man with a bomb and phone inside him is conveniently in the right place at the right time, somehow avoiding the police metal detectors or dying from his surgery.In the end the story is too unbelievable and too long as well. You dont care about anyone, as everything is too unrealistic. Therefore this film cannot ever be considered a 10/10, almost regardless of opinion. I quite liked the filming and the mood of the film, but it has too many flaws to be considered that good.I gave it a 1/10, which is too harsh, but I felt obligated to bring down the overall rating. 
Too much of everything	1	Illinois	There were just too many subplots, too much violence, and it was at least a half hour too long. They should have taken some of the time they spent planning CGI effects and used it to seal some of the plot holes: 1. A witness pulls a gun out while hes on the witness stand? Excuse me?? This is some mythic land where the courthouses dont have metal detectors? 2. Theres a terrorist threat against a hospital, so they evacuate every patient--*except* the one whos been in all the papers.3. The police are transporting a high-profile prisoner, with dozens of vehicles escorting him and SWAT teams all over the place--but one trailer truck starts chasing them and theyre all helpless.4. The silliest thing of all--Batmans constant whispering. Its supposed to make him sound menacing, but he just sounds like he has laryngitis. Its like the old Superman TV show where people magically have no idea who he is as long as he keeps his glasses on.I know Im way in the minority on this one, but I have to say this was the ugliest, stupidest movie Ive ever seen. I would have walked out if I werent trapped at the end of an aisle. You couldnt pay me enough to sit through it again. 
I didnt like it! Oh! Heaven for offend!!!	1	midwest	There is nothing special about this movie. Period. Nothiing special. It tries on so many levels to be this big mega movie, and in financial terms, it was, but you know what? Its still not good, no matter how many fans it has, no matter how much money it pulls in. Those are just figures and numbers, and theyre quite boring in the long run. Lets go over a few reasons why it was not good. First off, the story bites off way more than is necessary. We have Bruce Wayne in this ridiculous attempt to win back a woman hell never have the chance to be with. The woman he is in love with prances around like a little school girl, and really has no business being in the story to begin with. She is just there to make both Batman and Harvey Dent rival each other. Im so sure that the writers could have come up with a better plan to pit the two against each other than that. Then, theres the Joker...the most ridiculous part of the story. Ridiculous because of the lengths and the means that the filmmakers took to bring a new kind of villain. Its not entertaining, its not disturbing, its just sick. This movie was not fun. It was not entertaining. It was a product for the mindless audiences who were going to buy into it anyway, and especially because of the death of Heath edger. Lets talk a little about that. This film had success that rode the curtail of Ledgers death. The studio deliberately used the poor suffering of a human being to push a film into exhibition. Thats really sad, and you know what else? Its all this film will ever be...the last film of Heath Ledger, and America went to see it because he died before its release. sad. Really sad. I didnt like it, and I bet others will not like me for that very reason. Even more sad still. 
Who payed the critics	1	United States	I am deeply shocked. I am really shocked that this film made it all the way to the top. Its OK with me that it is a huge success at the box office. I can cope with it that many, many people do not have the same taste as me. Even though it is a little sad because I think this somewhat strange taste of the comic buffs will influence the movies in the future even more. There are interesting articles about the influence of the bloggers and hardcore fans on producers and directors. What really shocks me here is that many, many acclaimed critics fail to see how bad this movie is. They write about hidden stories, meanings and messages. The war in Iraq, the war against terrorism, a reflection of American society and so on. They write about hilarious performances of the actors. They write about stunning visual effects. Some of them may even write about the tremendous script. Fortunately so far I did not read anything about the scriptwriting. So I try to begin with that issue. Well, the script is so down, down, deep down below that I dont even know where I shall begin. I guess the guys who are more in the comic stuff will tell you that Jonathan Nolan really did a good job in adopting the stories and the mood of the comic books. But for me this is no reason to write a story that lacks everything and is so brain dead that Im gasping for air. The plot is annoying and predictable. The characters are written really poorly. First of all Harvey Dent. His turning into a fallen Angel is so incredibly incredible. It may result from the way that the brains of the comic buffs work. 9 Pictures or less per page. I that time you can turn from a white hero into a black devil. But this is a movie. And no 9c trash book. To say it clear  and you may have noticed  I am no comic fan. But I like for instance Sin City very much. It is a very good adaptation into a now medium. And it is visually very interesting. Visuals. As I said Sin City is visually very interesting. The dark Knight is not. Totally not. Almost two decades before we saw TerminatorII. Oh my god, this was something new. And Two Face  Aaron Eckhart looked a little like the wrecked Arni back then. Dont get me wrong the make up apartment did a very good job. It is just so sad that we already saw it all before. (Just like the inspection of the new weapons Is this a scene of one of the Bond Movies?) Or take the Matrix (Part1) about one decade before. Visually the dark knight is not one tick better or more interesting. Maybe on the same level. Sin City was something new. The dark Knight shows us common techniques in a slightly higher perfection. The directing is average. Not outstanding. It must have been a logistic masterpiece, OK. But we have seen it before. The acting. I cant even say if the actors are bad. I think it is the story that is so poor. The Joker is good. Heath Ledger is good. Not brilliant or something like that. It is solid work. And he is the only character that is somewhat interesting and not full of pathetic crap. Well to draw the conclusion again. I can live with it that this movie is that successful at the box office. I can not live with the super high praising comments of professional critics. For action entertainment this movie is too long. At least one hour is simply annoying. (Again the writing.) So, who ever has some bucks left go see this movie and see what brain damaged means. 
If not the dark knight....then nothing	9	India	I feel regret of seeing this film lately.This movie is a mixture of incredible performances and absolute photography and incredible direction.If credits are to be given for this movie heath ledger is on first row.His performance was never before and never after.coming to batman,bale is as usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled the story with some emotions,some action in perfect way.He is absolute genius and a perfect director with wide knowledge on all movie aspects.This is master piece of Nolans art.I am amazed with the jokers performance his body language his confidence and his attitude and the list goes on......heath ledger kept his soul on this movie and he provided life to the joker.if u still havent seen this movie,then what the hell are you waiting for.... 
Not a good Batman film. Over-rated in the Extreme.	1	United States	damn i cant believe the reviews for this film. Ive only seen this twice and dont plan on seeing it again anytime soon, and this coming from a lifelong batman MOVIE fan (note the emphasis on MOVIE, not COMICS).Ive seen the original film 200000 times and i loved all the sequels, even the campy Schumacher ones. but boy did they take this franchise in a reverse direction. JUST because batman  robin was terrible and silly doesnt make Christopher Nolans films the comic book equivalent of the godfather or gone with the frigging wind. if anything, they only show how amazing Tim Burtons 2 original dual pictures are, and how utterly lame the Nolan ones are. not only is the dark knight worse then batman begins, its downright ridiculous! you feel like you need a degree in law to understand what the hell they are talking about. its like CSI meets Gotham city. you might as well call this movie GCPD or GCPD Blue, or any of those law and order-type shows that this movie seems to copy from. its even more silly when you look at the lengths the director went through to make this batman movie as boring as possible. they seem to think if the story is engaging enough, we dont have to make the movie visually appealing. thats like saying if the story is good enough, we dont have to make batman look awesome in the comics.lets get this review started shall we? first, the joker. we are all familiar Im sure with jack Nicholsons classic portrayal from the original film. it was truly amazing, he made the character eerie, funny, and charming all at once. yet he seemed to understand that this character is based off cartoons and as such you cant take yourself all that seriously. this is the complete opposite of what heath ledger does with the same role. but i guess you cant really blame the actor entirely with Nolan wanting to change up batman and his world to the point that the characters arent really who they should be. first off, joker doesnt fall in a vat of acid like the original, he puts on makeup and cuts his own smile and dyes his hair green. i would hate to see his joker in the rain, he would look rather pathetic as a joker. i can guarantee that if Nicholson didnt already do this classic comics origin 20 years ago in the awesome first film, fan boys would be crying that joker was turned into common serial killer done a million times over in other films and not the funny amusing comic book clown prince of crime that everyone is more familiar with. oh, but since Nicholson already played THAT version to perfection, Nolan was somehow able to get away with turning joker into a common killer that weve seen time and again. Heath didnt really even play the&#xFEFF; Joker, he played generic serial killer bad guy #13314. for those who would defend ledger by saying he was really scary and terrifying, sure ill give them that, but to say he was better than NICHOLSON?!? JACK FREAKING NICHOLSON?!? PLEEEEEEEEEEASE!!! The role was virtually MADE for the man when he was born.&#xFEFF; Nicholson captured the true essence of the Joker; a psychopathic man child out not to prove a good damn thing, but to kill and mess around with people all for the laughs. THESE are traits that define the Joker, not some clich ideal of wanting people to accept that evil exists in all of us. and that brings me to another point, whats with this jokers anarchist pseudo-philosophic rambling monologues? boy Nolan LOVES these cardboard deep monologues he has his character spew out all the time, even in the last film. its laughable at how serious he takes the movie. did he forget this is based off of comic books and that there are supposed to be fun elements in the film? Tim Burton struck the perfect balance of comic book and reality. its somewhere right in the middle. Nolan puts a guy in a bat suit and places him right in middle of an unaltered real life city. it makes him look silly and out of place.Im not gonna dwell much on bales batman. this guy cant save any movie hes in. people seem to love this guy, or think hes some brilliant actor, but hes obviously just a wooden actor and once again phoned in his performance in this film. to quote Christopher walken from Batman Returns, hes just a poor schmo, who got lucky. his batman voice is ludicrous. ludicrous! i still dont understand why they decided to make batman sound like an engine turning over. every time he talks he makes me laugh. the only decently done things in this film is how Harvey dent is portrayed (pre-twoface) and the pretty nifty bat pod, that has ONE cool scene in which it bursts from the bat mobile. but again, the action scenes never pick up because of Nolans hard on for realism, so nothing in the new Batman films ever makes you go OOH Awesome for too long. this movie just dragged and i remember looking at the clock as to when it would end. they make it feel like the new Batmans are smart but honestly, in a comic book movie who the heck wants to listen to all this law and order talk and long drawn out deep monologues? its so....meh. id rather watch jack Nicholson laugh like a maniac shooting his henchman and making me laugh. who can forget gems like bob, gun. today you have why so serious?. yeah thats what i want to know, why so serious Nolan?? why cant you make batman fun? nothing against having darkness, Burtons films were dark too but not so much to the point where they werent fun or exciting. again, disappointed. 
gratuitous vileness	1	United States	One of the writers wanted it to be realistic? yer kidding..Could the joker realistically rig up all that stuff? ...cmon, maybe a bomb in a closet, but the characters mayhem seems very unlikely (hospital demolition was particularly overdone). And what a premise, ever been to a hospital? Full of hard working people helping sick and hurting folks, nice theme point to blow one full of innocent people up; Like i said gratuitous vileness, period. And could anyone understand what Batman was saying? So much of his dialog I replayed and even after several times, still couldnt make it out; perhaps all for the best.The movies set up -(of course to justify the conclusion), - is just all sort of contorted, irksome to this viewer. Another point of unbelieveability: when a person experiences really severe injuries, as one character did, how many scenes can you expect to play as a running around guy when you should actually be hanging by a thread in intensive care? We saw it on cable TV; did he perhaps turn super human during a commercial?Finally: does anyone know what becomes of our friend the Joker in the end? Maybe the TV version cut that out? It just sort of left him hanging.All in all, a pretty crumby premise, w/ whats become so overused and typical: sick motives, expressed by pathological plot themes and characters. Just more of the same sensationalism, like so much of todays action thriller stuff, nothing new here, just another film trying to out gross (and by that I mean: to be more grotesque, repulsively ugly or distorted and gruesome).For a viewer who enjoys action movies, or used to, from whats being produced now-a-days, - Im more inclined to pass them by and go for other genres. My recommendation: save your time and seek alternate entertainment to this gut wrenching tripe. Id say boycott it, and the stuff it imitates. Avoid it like you would trans fat and second hand smoke, it too will probably be found not not so good for us in the long run (exposure to sick minds carrying out sick motives. You can find entertainment alternatives that arent based on sicko themes!(and also, never try to do one of these reviews on an android, ouch. 
Best movie ever made?	1	United Kingdom	If Heath Ledger deserved an Oscar for this then why didnt Mickey Rourke win one for Sin City? simple answer is Sin city is a film based on a comic book, whereas The Dark knight is some kind of post 9/11 view of the world in which terrorists like Osama oLedgers character go around blowing up buildings and sending the police and the worlds media videos or virals or what ever the hell those crappy scenes are supposed to represent in order to instill fear and panic nice one Nolan for ruining a comic book fantasy by trying to be Stanley Kubrick or whoever the hell you were trying to be with this movie, and I am getting fed up with people saying this is how Batman should be represented just read the comic books, wheres robin how the hell are they going to write the penguin or cat woman into the story it was okay with the joker because they just stole the look of James obars the crow and attached it to a caricature of certain terrorists that in the last 10 years have caused death and destruction and let a film go out to the worlds media every now and then just like the joker in this film to let everyone know there still around, I cant even describe how pretentious this piece of c**p is it was okay with batman begins but with this it seems as if Nolans made a serious political statement while using the guise of a comic book that was written in the 1930s. Personally I think the first Batman film despite its many flaws is still the only true representation of batman from Gotham city to the noir aspects and even the characters, Heath Ledgers joker is in no way comparable to the joker character Bob Kane created, and the way he played the joker was just irritating I just wanted to punch him out I found him not in the least bit scary or intimidating he just needed a good punch to the throat, if you want to check out some good performances of lunatics check out Dennis Hopper in Blue velvet Rutger Hauer in the hitcher or Gary Oldman in Leon who also happens to be the only good thing about this film, Christian bale is just c**p as Bruce Wayne and batman like he was the last time and like he is in every other movie he has made with the exception of American psycho in which he played a t**t basically just had to turn up to set and be himself. But just like the godfather this is just going to be another over hyped piece of garbage that people rave on about for the next thousand years or until some other film maker makes another batman film where he is this time played by a woman in space on a space station fighting Genghis khan because this is how far these movies are moving away from the source material this very film is based on. The film is disgusting to look at as well, at least Burton and Schumachers Gotham citys looked original (and yes I know he put the statue of liberty into batman forever but this film is just garbage) and not just like new york. They might as well as called this film heat as well seeing as it has so many shots of tall buildings in fact I might just go watch heat as it is a better made film without a pretentious plot and decent actors with a good script with well thought out direction and alarmingly a faster pace then this turgid piece of excrement, if you want my advice watch batman 1 then heat and then turn on the news after that and you will pretty much get the gist of the dark knight but in a more enjoyable way and wont have to sit through this demoralising piece of rubbish. If you happen to be below the age of thirteen or just a geek who cant get a girlfriend or boyfriend then you will probably think this film rules personally i think it is c**p 
Basic entertainment - nothing more	1	Denmark	Im sorry but I dont get it. Why is everybody so crazy about this movie? Is it because of the effects? We have seen better, even in old movies. This one didnt impress me. Is it because of the story? We have seen better! The story and the characters in this movie seem to be taken from an old-days Disney fable. OK.. Is it because the actor who plays the Joker died in real life after finishing it? If thats the reason, why is that exciting? And anyway, then it has nothing to do with cinema itself! I admire the performance of the two main male actors: both Bale and Ledger play very well indeed, as usual. But unfortunately their job cant compensate for the flat performances of their colleagues, specially that of Maggie Gyllenhaal, nor for the many deficiencies of the script. The result is an unbalanced movie: the interactions between the characters is awkward, they move around in a world that doesnt seem to fit them. A bit predictable, a bit overloaded. For a movie to be a classic, it has to give you something, it has to make you grow and it has to grow in you. This movie is definitely not in this category. 
This film does not belong in the top 10 Movies of all time.	1	United States	Firstly, I wish to say that I think The Dark Knight is a very good movie. As an average Batman fan, I think that this version of the Batman chronicles balances artful pathos with run-of-the-mill mainstream icons and themes.Secondly, my goal is to make a brief point that this film has no place in the top 10 movies of all time.Thirdly and lastly, in order to make my point, I would like you to review the top 10 list below.1. The Shawshank Redemption (1994) 455,891 2. 9.1 The Godfather (1972)372,101 3. 9.0 The Godfather: Part II (1974) 218,313 4. 8.9 Il buono,il brutto, il cattivo. (1966) 137,484 5. 8.9 Pulp Fiction (1994)372,926 6. 8.8 Schindlers List (1993) 247,064 7. 8.8 One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest (1975) 190,056 8. 8.8 12 Angry Men (1957) 100,190 9. 8.8 The Dark Knight (2008) 403,372 10. 8.8 Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980)Now, ask yourself the question does The Dark Knight belong in this list? I do not think it does. My opinion: I do not think that the The Dark Knight meets the basic criteria of Character Development and story/plot/dialog quality. It is a 2 dimensional action film that wants to nick the surface of character development but fails to meet the challenge. 
Cant believe this is still top 10	1	United States	People who know and study FILM will all have the same basic review of this MOVIE. Its overacted (and yes, Heath Ledger is included in that remark) and just an overall horrible script. The whole why so serious bit was again, overacted, and SO predictable. I wrote better dialogue when I was a toddler. Then comes the completely unfathomable events - Nolan wanted the movie to be realistic but he clearly is a moron for that statement because only pre-teens and people pretending to go along with the hype would believe the whole cell phone bomb inside a guys stomach. And a gun in court? COME ONE STOP INSULTING ME! The fact that this movie is ANYWHERE in the top 250 proves that people are generally stupid. 
Really bad movie disguised (and not very well!) as a good one!	1	United States	THE DARK KNIGHT is ALL hype and no substance! Ive seen it 3 times and it is just plain awful. Basically, it is too long and convoluted as all get out. It felt 4 hours long to me the first time I saw it...no kidding! I guess the confusing part is worse than the long part. If a film flows smoothly for its run, length ought not be an issue, but TDK is utterly messy and confusing for its running time. So Nolan wants a REALISTIC version of BATMAN? Then explain SOME things to us! The big one is HOW DOES JOKER SET ALL THIS STUFF UP?At least BATMAN BEGINS was grounded in realism, explained motivations, techniques, and plans, and had a aura of realism. After BB was over, I remember thinking I LIKED THIS MOVIE! Although Im a Burton Batman fan, I admit that Nolan did a very good job with BB; it feasibly defined a realistic Batman world while still embodying a sense of fun and had a lot of entertainment value. And the plot made sense! But after TDK was over, my impression was WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? Some points about why TDK is a weak film to me: *Harvey Dent swallows all that gasoline and isnt even sick enough to hurl! He is badly burned, but his rage and need for vengeance dulls his pain and he easily walks around and does not scare the Bejesus out of anyone? NO ONE is shocked by the way he looks! Seriously, Nolan?*Gordon and Batman decide that Dent/TwoFace will be a hero and no one will know that he killed 5 people. EXCEPT for them, Gordons family, and that bad cop Ramirez! Im sure they will ALL keep it a secret...Plothole! *Maggie Gyllenhall as Rachel Dawes not attractive! Katie Holmes from BB wasnt jaw-droppingly gorgeous, but she WAS fairly easy on the eyes! And Holmes worked much better in this role in BB, had a LOT more chemistry with Bale, and had an important function to the story. When Joker says that she (Gyllenhalls Rachel) is a beautiful woman, I was like, NO SHES NOT! Gyllenhaal is perhaps a better actress than Holmes, but Holmes was actually much more right for the role of Rachel Dawes. Gyllenhaal literally has nothing to do and just doesnt cut it in TDK. *Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman, who just exists in this film, nothing else) has the ability to do ANYTHING technological? This includes constructing a sonar device that can scan all 30 million cell phones in Gotham City simultaneously. Or did Bruce Wayne in his very limited technological training and experience do it? Either way...OK. Yeah. Right. Whatever. In BB, the stuff Fox was selling Wayne at least seemed plausible. In TDK, it comes off as just plain absurd technobabble!*Batman and Joker get the crap beat out of them repeatedly, chewed up by dogs, fall from multiple story buildings and dont even get hurt. When Batman saved Rachel, they fell from the penthouse of a CHICAGO high-rise for cripes sake. That must have been 100 stories easy! No bones broken, no trauma, just ho-hum, back to business.*That climactic ferry boat scene is pure de Hollywood manipulation! It is there solely to reel the viewer in to make it seem like TDK is some kind of original, provocative piece. Instead, it comes across as sappy, maudlin, and empty. The ending to that scene is soooooo predictable! *In general, though, TDK is choppily edited, is populated with one-dimensional, lifeless characters, is humorless, convoluted as heck, has dull dialogue, and is VERY clich. I mean, its barely even a DECENT movie!Christian Bale was great in BB, but in TDK, Nolans hack direction and the script really let him down, making him look like a laughingstock as a hero. He was barely even in TDK and when he was in it, you didnt get any feel for the character so well-established in BB. What makes Bruce Wayne/Batman tick? What does he really want? Just based on one dinner where Dent spouts about being a crusader, Wayne thinks that hes THE ONE, the savior of Gotham City? Not very deep character development. In addition to Freeman, you have Michael Caine as Waynes butler/accomplice Alfred, Gary Oldman as Lt. Gordon, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, all giving rather lifeless performances. Ironically, I think Eckhart has the biggest male role in the film, but unfortunately Dent is not very accessible and rather empty to the viewer. Really, Bale shares lead honors with Oldman, Eckhart, and Ledger; actually, Oldman and Eckhart may have bigger roles in this than Bale and Ledger! Who wants a Batman flick where neither Batman (the main hero) nor the Joker (the main villain) have the biggest role? These skilled actors are unfortunately operating from a vapid script and extremely short-sighted character development.Tim Burtons surrealistic, neo-noir, skewed, artsy, comic book BATMAN flicks (BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS) are truly the best Batman movies. We accept at face value those films because Burtons unique vision not only strived for something different for a superhero movie, but also succeeded in a way that Nolans films just cannot. Batman the bad guy who is hated by the entire city of Gotham?!. No way, not in superhero world, not acceptable! And I dont care what these nouveau moviegoers so enthralled with this film think! 
more mainstream and overrated than Britney Spears...	1	Athens, Greece	I saw batman begins and liked it although at the beginning i had a negative feeling. For the dark knight i went to the movies with the greatest expectations, after the big commercial that followed heath ledgers death everyone seemed to have liked it.What a disappointment that was. The movie is not bad but the critics make me hate it. Seriously i think that there are some movies ine the top #250 that are overrated but this one takes the cake....From where i have to start? the action scenes are nothing spectacular, even tim burtons movie had better ones... The music doesnt fit at the most of the sequences theres a repetitive tired to death theme that makes in almost every sequence( thats the feeling i had ). Batmans voice is like robocop is talking or something like that its not even clear what he is saying in some points. I think it would be easier to say what i liked on this movie cause there are not many things i liked....Well heath ledgers acting was good although i think that jack nickolsons acting was more close to what i had in mind of joker character, more sarcastic and funny in a crazy way. Heath made a good bad guy but he is more serious than a joker should be, so why so serious?Avoid this movie there are a lot of better movies out there, its just a trendy hype that i hope in some years will fade away. 
Soulless, anticlimactic, over-hyped and finally..not Batman!	1	Australia	The Dark Knight is the worst sequel since Highlander 2: The Quickening. I am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re-invigorated so wonderfully with Batman Begins. I speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it, ergo people dont like it. I really think this film is the biggest dupe since The Blair Witch Project. I want to make it clear that I love Batman, Bob Kanes Batman, Frank Millers Batman, Jeph Loebs Batman and the DC Animated Universes Batman. Like many, I found the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films excruciating to watch. Batman Begins came along and Christopher Nolan gave us a Batman we could respect and understand as well as believe. We were then teased with The Jokers calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen history....and we got....a joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist, no batcave, a batsuit that looked like a riot cop, a convoluted Scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime, a Two-Face whos only motive is a dead girlfriend, a Batman we hardly see, and a Gotham City that now looks like Chicago. But the enigma I cant stomach is that the film HAD NO CLIMAX!!! I asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each time...oh it was Batman confronting Dent...no it was the Joker hanging upside down, no it was Rachel Dawes being killed.....NO there was no climax! This films success lies only in the sad fact that its main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film. In Nolans attempt to legitimise the Batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring. 
10/10 Is Absurd	1	United States	First let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star. My real rating would be a six to an eight (depending on your taste in movies) but I had to compensate.Compensate for what? Well, literary device, Im glad you asked. Toolsthe answer is tools. No, not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver. Im talking about people, people who are easily swayed by other peoples opinions and by mass marketing campaigns. Unfortunately, almost everyone in America (including myself) is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool. Now I realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots. If they have ever given The Dark Knight 10/10 stars or referred to it as one of/the greatest movies of all time well then Lil Miss Daisy Im afraid you have a huge tool on your hands. I recommend immediate euthanasia.Why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews, I simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. Its quite simple really. The media told everyone they should likeso they did. These people then went out and told their friends that they should like itso they did. And these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like itso they did. So it went until one day TDK topped the list of IMDbs greatest movies of all time. What it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage. Had the initial media coverage been negative and Heath Ledger (God rest his soul) not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for Hollywood this never would of happened. Basically what Im saying is someone told you this movie was good, so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws. And while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet I feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess. Too many people told you it was good. You went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws. This movies current average (9/10) is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified. Its an OK movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted. 
Wow...	1	United States	Good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie??? Well, according to most people, I guess so. But for people like me (unfortunately there arent too many of us individual-minded thinkers left), it takes a good STORY to lure us in. To me, this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed... of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on. A way-overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what I got out of it. One thing after another made me feel like I was watching Batman: The Law  Order Miniseries. Oh yeah, for one of the best, if not the best movie of all time, this thing didnt leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable, likable story. Funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away lets see... the cinematography and special effects. 
Fight Club for stupid people	1	NYC	Instead of questioning Capitalism, Communism, Taoism or Existentialism... and challenging the audience... it is about corruption and surrendering to corruption like surrendering to jaded teen boredom. Fueled by the claustrophobic helplessness due to terrorism, and the merciless acceptance of hipster nihilism, TDK is a cold unrealistic mechanical set-up sold over and over again by its proponents as ultra-realistic. That is the most frightening thing about the obsessive if not immoral blatherings of TDK fans is the Emperors New Clothes insistence that the film represents realism. From the Jokers precision timing to drive a school bus into a line of school buses, with one space left for him... to Dents facial damage due to 5 seconds of burning gasoline... the film is rife with movie fakeness sold like Ad (or ADD) pitchmen for Nolans formulaic realism, which is actually just him stealing from The Long Halloween.A meaningless Rube Goldberg contraption, Nolan takes the audience on an endless set of fake-out twists and turns to deliver very little but loud moments. As calculated and obsessive as The Joker is, and to the degree he plans about 5 separate back up plans that come to fruition, he enters the level of anal retentive... yet somehow we are to believe he is some agent of chaos. Which, means cool. Chaos = cool, get it? Theres nothing cool or chaotic about this drugged out riffing Joker, and as fun as Ledger makes him, he overshadows what should have been the center of the story: Harvey Dent. But its Batman so, business as usual... problem child villain acts up, makes a mess, BatDad shows up to clean up the mess. Crowd applauds. Unfortunately what the film creates is a subtext of a NeoCon wetdream with by any means necessary militarism, where the Batman uses unethical means to detect the Joker, and we are to assume this fall from grace makes him heroic because he is banished and falsely accused (for 1 minute of nagging by the Joker, turning Dent evil for yet another film coincidence) of driving Dent from white to dark knight... so Batman takes the blame and is the dark knight cuz hes just a Christ figure. So our sacrificial Justice League hero is supposed to be a sympathetic figure of crossing moral boundaries to save society... George Bush must have loved this puppy. Not sure half the tween tards watching this caught that bit of hooey, but as much as the poster art evokes Fight Club, this film is about as far from punk anarchy as you can get. Maybe they should all be sent to military school if this is their idea of rebellion. 
Where is the story?	1	United States	After I was done watching this movie, I was sitting there waiting for it to begin. There was no story. There was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen. Unbearably trite performances all around. Can Morgan Freeman play anything other than Morgan Freeman? I was waiting for the scene when he tells Batman that he is really God and that Batman has to be God for a day, i.e. Batman Almighty.Were given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters. This was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects, explosions, and other eye candy. The only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing, but in that regard, it did not live up to Batman Begins. Nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove. The love is gone and its showing in a big way.The Batmobile was fun to watch, but that hardly makes a movie.Please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves. Make Nolan and other film-makers do more than throw gobs of money at ILM to make a movie. 
Horrible	1	United States	This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you think that it will be as good a the original I urge you to never watch this. Heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not Oscar worthy, but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in Brokeback Mountain. The use of the Harvey character was pathetic and Christian Bale is one of the wost actors to ever play Batman. His Bruce Wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie, other than Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordan. The whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects. I would recommend watching the original batman with Michael Keaton any day. Dont waste your time with this crap written by Nolan, he is a hack. Unless you like Batman sounding like he is Satan... dont watch this film 
Just four words	1	Sofia, Bulgaria	Ridiculously overrated, monumentally disappointing.Whoa, IMDb wont let me post this. Its too short, obviously.Well, then let me tell you this - I never cared for the re-franchising of Batman. Its just more of the Hollywood-style money making. And the more money they put into a film and its promotion, the more hype they create. But it sadly isnt just about them wanting us all to go see the movie. No, they get really greedy and after a certain point is reached, they proclaim this same movie is a piece of art.Its that simple. And if you can succeed in believing it is, it makes your life easier and jollier. You go to IMDb.com, you give it a 10, you read some exuberantly positive comments and smile contentedly, you read some unfavourable ones and mutter to yourself that there are always idiots who just dont get it, and youre happy, cause millions of people are desperately trying to prove to each other that they are part of something bigger than life, and are succeeding in that endeavour, and you are one of them.Not me, guys, not me. I like a lot of stupid films, but not this one. It makes me sick, for it reminds me how gullible we all are and just how much we want to dream. But we only want the dreams to come on the big screen - this is one of the many possible ways, kindly provided by our great benefactors, we can spend our ugly dollars on something shiny and new and inspiring, and harmless. And easy to digest.So, be happy, eat your popcorn, feel nice, eat well after the movie, sleep tight, dream beautifully, but dont bother trying to wake up, cause we are all in a really comfortable place and waking up will be very painful. On the other hand, the dream factory could keep you contented by offering you another piece of art for 10$ or thereabouts. Kudos to our benefactors and encore! 
Its not really that great of a movie	5	Philadelphia, PA	Im so relieved that Im not the only one who doesnt think this movie is great. I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably wouldve given it a bit higher rating...if I wouldve reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesnt hold up as well outside of the movie theater with its huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and couldve done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie shouldve focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That wouldve been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasnt some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesnt emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I couldve lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. Theres really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, cmon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. Its just too much. Too many things going on that dont really gel together. I guess Im tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, Ill watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasnt any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesnt live up to the hype. 
Dark and Dreary	4	None	Although an average film, Batman Begins had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolans dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make Batman Ends. 
Gimme A Break	4	Canada	This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still cant say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldnt see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super heros outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldnt even move properly in it,(heck, he couldnt even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)Ill tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasnt. Disappointment? You betchaa!Long Live Jack Nicholson. 
The movie is over rated. People are voting emotionally.	5	Australia	I was very disappointed with this movie. I made the error of watching it, based on the high score it is recording in the reviews on the IMDb. I could quite easily have given it away after 15-20 minutes, but I persevered with it.I only persevered for one reason, I wanted to see what was probably Heath Ledgers last complete performance. I rated his performance very highly and he deserves to be considered for any of the upcoming awards shows, truly on merit.I thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing, as Batman and there really wasnt very much of a story line to the movie. I cannot understand how this is rated a 9 out of 10 at present. That must mean, that all reviewers are between 18-30 and you are all giving it nine or ten. Ten being the perfect score for the perfect movie, I think some of you have let your emotions get away with you.I scored it 5 out of 10. 
The Joke(r) is on Us!	2	I am here. Where are you?	The Batsuit can deflect bullets, but it cant withstand a dog attack? Holy Wardrobe Malfunction! If I were Bruce Wayne, I would have kicked Morgan Freemans backside back to The Electric Company, and sued the crap out of the firm that made the material that was supposed to protect my richer-than-God self from the likes of Cujo! But then, that would make way too much sense, and sense is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having!Say what you will about Tim Burtons and Joel Schumachers Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Dont tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting Come on, come on, hit me  la Jack? Batman doesnt turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed agent of chaos, every one of The Jokers actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up chaos in the dictionary!Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but lets be real: if he hadnt died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldnt have sprung up, and he wouldnt have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said!And its close to the vest, NOT close to the chest! Idiots! 
plot is illogical, aesthetic uninspired, casting poor, acting sloppy, editing rushed, and larger themes unconvincing	1	United States	The Dark Knights extreme popularity must be due to saturation advertising, hype, the popularity of the Batman franchise, and a star-studded cast. Looked at objectively, it fails on a number of levels.SPOILER WARNING: This comment talks extensively about the plot of the movie.A) The script is full of illogical events. 1) Batman jumps out of a window on the 50th floor to rescue Rachel, catches her, and smashes with her onto a car in the street below, and they both walk away unscathed, despite the fact that no parachutes were deployed and no wings broke their fall. 2) The Joker somehow fills large places throughout the city with large oil canisters full of explosives, with no one seeing, including Gothams largest hospital and two ferry boats, after advertising that these places would be targeted. 3) Midway through the movie, the white knight of justice, District Attorney Harvey Dent, does a 180 degree turn when his girlfriend is killed and becomes a psychotic killer, for no reason whatsoever. 4) Early in the movie, the Joker goes on a rampage and then makes demands and the entire city clamors not for his defeat but for all his demands to be met. 5) Dogs can bite through the bulletproof bat suit. 6) Two Rottweilers can take down and immobilize Batman. 7) The Joker can singlehandedly overpower Batman without any weapons. 8) The police act as buffoons throughout the movie: they put the Joker in a cell with other prisoners; interrogate him without handcuffs; let him out of the interrogation room when he takes the interrogator hostage; and give him a cell phone to use, which he then uses to trigger an explosion in the building that kills everyone but, miraculously, him. 9) The Joker drives alongside a police caravan and systematically picks off one police car after another with a bazooka, and the police continue driving along at the same plodding pace. 10) Batman shoots at the Joker and fights him and flips his 18-wheeler truck, but when he is about to hit the Joker with his motorcycle, he crashes it instead and puts himself at the mercy of the Joker in a fit of GI Joe morality. 11) Morgan Freeman objects to Batmans cell phone mapping technique, saying Too much power for one man, and resigns as his assistant, despite Batmans lifelong pursuit of lawless vigilantism.B) Aesthetically the movie is unimaginative and uninspiring. 1) Batman as a fighter is stiff. His suit is like a slab of sheet metal welded together. His movement is the opposite of the smooth, flowing martial artist one sees in classic samurai or judo movies. Batman arrives without stealth, by smashing through windows into hails of gunfire, and departs in a similarly unstealthy manner. This is the opposite of how a ninja would behave: with intelligence, grace, simplicity, and secrecy. Similarly, the Batmobile smashes through reinforced concrete walls and sits still to absorb a hail of gunfire. The Batman envisioned here -- smashing everything in his path, and indestructible -- is more like the Incredible Hulk than a bat. 2) Set design is drab. The scene in the kitchen, of the conference of mafiosi, is plain, uninspired, and unimaginative. The parking garage scene is aesthetically dull. The bat cave is quite plain -- just a long, empty room with a low, internally lit ceiling, without any gear whatsoever.C) The casting is poor and the acting uninspired and sloppy. 1) Morgan Freeman is a dreadful choice. His acting and presence is like the feel-good music that often accompanies his scenes. Just play the music and skip him. 2) Aaron Eckhart relies too much on his good looks and smile and not enough on acting. He sounds like a motivational speaker -- that is, a liar -- trying to convince, but unconvincing. His body language in the scene on top of the building is very fake: amateur-aggressive. 3) The actor playing Commissioner Gordon is about as good as a director standing in for an actor who couldnt make it to rehearsal. He has no energy or presence on screen. I appreciate understatement in acting, but he seems to be half asleep and mumbles his way through his lines. 4) Maggie Gyllenhaal is unconvincing as the object of desire of both heroes. 5) The black mafia boss is terrible. The other mafia bosses are not much better: overacting without direction or intelligence. 6) The man who turns from a meek bank supervisor to a tough vigilante in the first scene is too self-conscious, and his transition is unbelievable. He is too recognizable as an actor. 7) The acting by extras is very bad and poorly directed. When the Joker says half, the chorus of laughter is like that in a high school musical. The same unanimity of action is found at the press conference. The thugs in the parking garage seem like models, not thugs.D) The editing is too fast; transitions are largely dispensed with altogether. 1) There is no pause before the cut to the trial; dialogue from the two scenes runs together. 2) The scene at the benefit party is unconvincing: Bruce Wayne drops the models immediately, people applaud immediately, its over. Scenes are too fast and perfunctory.E) In its larger themes, the movie proves to be just as illogical and perplexing as in its minutest details. The end of the movie carries this message: Sometimes the truth isnt good enough ... Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. This is used to justify the creation of a myth of Harvey Dent as Savior Of Gotham, and to explain the need for making Batman the fall guy for all of Dents crimes. However, the movie makes no attempt to explain why Dent, the psychopath, should be eulogized and not Batman, the hero. The writer floats a thesis about the human need for myths on a raft of unpersuasive evidence. 
If you liked this movie, dont vote.	1	United States	bad parts of this movie:--The action scenes sucked, other than at the beginning. -The action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid, batman hitting him, the joker hitting him back and then walking away, and something exploding -In a good movie, the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it, but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife-This movie was not inspiring. What does it inspire me to do? Pay a British douche a lot of money so I can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals.Speaking of the bat suit: -If part of batmans sacrifice is that the city hates him then WHY DOES HE HAVE A SPECIAL UNIFORM? If youre supposed to be hated by everyone, wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself. If you are trying to be loved by the people, then you can advertise.-The movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening. Right after the love triangle, the girl died. That guy said he was gonna reveal batmans identity, but nothing happens.--There was so much that didnt make any sense. -How does one guy in Hong Kong do the accounting for all the criminals in Gotham? -Why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days? Thats better than things are usually in big cities. -Why dont the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him? etc.-The joker wasnt creepy. There is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling. If he walked in to a bar, cut a guys head off, and then ordered a salad, that would be creepy.-A superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool. Batman is a superhero just because hes rich.good parts: -The credits. 
Distinctly average and surprisingly rather dull	5	United Kingdom	It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, Im not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolans second stab at Batman as well as Christian Rant Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho despite its reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a masterpiece, the best movie of 2008 so far, far surpasses Begins. No, it isnt and no it doesnt. All I can say is that these people have not seen many masterpieces or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a moral dilemma and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the we being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledgers last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. Its not bad, its not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you wont be missing much at all. 
A Major Disappointment	3	Seattle, Washington	This movie was so wildly praised by critics and fans alike that it was hard not to have somewhat diminished expectations. It cant be *that* great, right? Right.I cant say this is a bad movie, just not a very interesting one. It begins promisingly with a superbly executed set piece, with the Joker staging a daring bank robbery. This is a very nicely done action sequence, and Heath Ledgers Joker does indeed live up to the hype. Its a genuinely strange characterization, and the story built around it should work.After that, the movie starts to drag. There are far too many long, talky sequences, followed by the usual slam-bang action scenes that are shot from a distance so you cant see whats really going on. Whats really missing from the action is any sense of a story; theres just more of the same that you usually see in a superhero picture. Been there, done that.Another fatal mistake is one that happens far too often: too many villains. This was a major problem with the 90s Batman films: you have to squeeze the Penguin and Catwoman and Christopher Walken into one film, with no time left for anything like character development. In this movie, the focus is on the Joker, but thats not enough: we have Two-Face into the mix (who only becomes Two-Face at the two-hour mark, leaving only a short time for him to be dispatched by our hero).Two-Face was my favorite of the old Batman Rogues Gallery, and he deserved a story all his own. Throwing him in as an afterthought to the Joker (particularly when Ledgers scenery chewing overshadows everything else in the picture, including Batman) both makes the film far too long, and blunts its impact.Lost somewhere in all this is Batman, who almost seems absent from the picture. Although he has to make a tragic choice, there seems to be no character development, and Bales performance is practically phoned in. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman contribute their customary gravitas, but again this just adds to the extreme length of the picture.Batman Begins was a strong picture, and Im puzzled as to what Im missing here. I saw this on Blu-Ray and found myself reaching for the remote every ten minutes or so, to see how much longer I was going to have to watch this. I finally hit Stop by accident at 2 hrs., but decided to just let it go. This movie failed to engage my interest on any level and I just wanted it to end. 
fanboy cacca	1	None	A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like masterpiece and crime-epic. Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I dont blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious.I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want more realism as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isnt a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks dont pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what.I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works.EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros.  the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things. 
Very disappointing and a step backward for Batman	3	United States	I was not expecting this film to live up to the hype, but it didnt even come close to living up to my lowered expectations. I give it 3 stars only for Heath Ledgers performance, which was very original and nicely done, but still not deserving of the rave reviews it has been receiving. Even his excellent performance was brought down by the horrible script he had to work with.Its all been said before, but:- The acting of every cast member except for Heith Ledger was wooden and utterly boring.- The Batman character was unsympathetic and had none of the appeal that was built up in Batman Begins of a tormented soul nonetheless trying to do good. In this film he is both boring, nasty, and indecisive.- Every fight scene was mechanical, unoriginal, shot in dim lighting, and used none of the stealth that Batman is supposed to use.- Batmans voice was laughable and got worse as the film dragged on.- Way too many convoluted and disconnected subplots to keep track of. I had no idea where the story was going at any point in time, and didnt care. I watched this on DVD and started fast-forwarding through large chunks about 2 hours into the movie; should have done this sooner.- Every character spouted sophomoric monologues about good and evil that were unconvincing. A good script gets these messages across using the plot and actions of the characters, not through monologues.- The Jokers various schemes and escapes were impossible to believe even in the context of a comic good movie. How could the Joker walk into a hospital, with full makeup on, and walk right up to Harvey Dent, who is unguarded, *after* the Joker has already kidnapped and disfigured Dent once, *and* the Joker has announced he is going to attack a hospital? This kind of thing happened countless times. I love comic book movies (e.g., Xmen 1 & 2, Iron Man), but in the good ones you can believe that the events would actually happen within the context of the fantasy world of the story.- The love triangle story felt tacked-on. What in the story showed you that Bruce Wayne and Rachel, or Harvey Dent and Rachel, had any affection for each other? You are just supposed to accept all of this without any effort by the scriptwriters or actors.- The Joker has an endless crew of henchmen, but why would any criminal agree to work for the Joker after he assassinates his entire crew in the first scene? Why would any criminal agree to work for him if his goal is just to cause chaos and not to earn money, and he burns all the money he earns? Dont criminals normally want to get money out of risking their lives to commit crimes?- Two and a half hours is way too long. An hour could have been cut without missing it. Compare this to any truly great movie (Gandhi, Godfather 1 & 2), where several hours just fly by.- The scriptwriters couldnt decide whether to make this a realistic drama or a comic book for the screen. So they flip-flopped back and forth. Case in point: a witness on the stand pulls out a gun, Harvey Dent disarms him, and then wants to continue examining the witness. This is slapstick and is impossible to swallow if we are supposed to believe this is the real world, but it could work if the whole movie set a comic book tone in which ridiculous things like this happen. But it didnt, so the inconsistencies are just jarring. At least the Tim Burton films -- and even the campy 1960s Batman TV show! -- created an internally consistent world.- I was ready for the movie to be over, when in comes a whole separate story about Two Face. It was completely out of place with whatever plot arc still existed at that point. Plus, the transformation of Harvey Dents character into Two Face made no sense, as did his ability to survive a car-flipping accident. Then we witness him shoot Batman, who we have already seen surviving hundreds of bullets without a scratch, and we are supposed to be surprised when Batman leaps up again, unharmed?I could write another whole review just listing more plot holes.Again, I am a big fan of comic book movies and even enjoyed Batman Begins, but this was a real loser. 
hyped garbage	1	United States	This movie is seriously over hyped crap. From a completely technical view it has some merits. Its well filmed, the shots and cutting are phenomenal. The plot has some merit although there was a whole of one thing I didnt see coming throughout the whole film. The one scene I enjoyed is on the boats, a deep look into humanitys fragile tempers. Christian Bale is terrible in his role of batman. His voice is so forced, he makes it way too gravelly and just botches the whole thing. He allows absolutely no subtlety and the love story angle is so contrived. God he was terrible. Oooh now we get to the poster boy Heath Ledger... OK I do have to grant that he did a fairly good job in his portrayal of the joker, his lines are well delivered and his acting is good. But this idea that he is now the holy grail of acting is just stupid. He died so now everyone feels like they cant critique him. When did death make you amazing? Fine then Hitler was a saint cause he died, we arent allowed to say he messed up.... ever. He did a good job but there have been far better actors. I feel the writing was almost as important to the character as his acting, doesnt matter how good you act if the writing sucks the movie sucks. On to a one Aaron Eckhart, decent acting. Far better in Thank you for smoking but thats besides the point. I dont have much to say other than he started really strong and finished off pretty weak. After one of the plot twists his acting just gets mediocre.All in all this movie would have been really good, I mean phenomenal if it werent for all of the hype around it. I saw it in theaters a day or so after opening and enjoyed it.... until about the 4 millionth why so serious? half an hour after it was over. It was good but it belongs in maybe the low hundreds on the top 250 list not top 10. 
Is The Dark Knight that good... really? Fraid not.	5	Auckland, New Zealand	The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledgers Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it shouldve borrowed). 
Not the greatest film ever made	5	Oakland CA	Time for a corrective. As I write this review, The Dark Knight is, according to IMDb voters, the Best. Film. Ever. At the risk of incurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers an excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er, COMMISSIONER Gordon--and its always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted, logically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and should not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book movies, its not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it aint so hot. The films first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely conclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this being a summer blockbuster, theres another 70 plus minutes to go, and the films second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a neat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of bizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?), illogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he apparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many ass-kickings in too little time). I dont expect 100% logical consistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and elisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolans screenplay that utter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the film, were expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of Gotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good work, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will end with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So lets tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark Knight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and amusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about the nature of the super hero). 
Knight Not SO Shining	1	United States	Before walking into this movie , i really had great expectations, what with the rave reviews the movie was being lavished with and the seemingly awesome trailer. And then came the moment of truth,the movie was very ordinary. I saw nothing special in this movie for me to even remotely praise it. It was long, many gaps in the plot in addition to scenes and story lines which seemed senseless and had no follow -up. Plus, there really was nothing artistic about it and it didnt actually have the enjoyable cinematic experience moviegoers would want to relish in. This was further aggravated with the poor lines in the film. In short the movie didnt get me all excited or sucked me into it. Throughout the entire film I was hardly able to connect to the film. That said however I wouldnt recommend folks to not watch it but just an advice to keep your hopes to a minimal point. 
Heath Ledger is a ledgend!	10	Australia	Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heaths other films like 10 Things I Hate About You and even Brokeback Mountain proves that this man could actually act, doesnt matter what character, he could do it.The films storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder whats next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess thats why they called it the Dark Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Faces face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledgers life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. Its great! 
not as good as all the hype	7	TN	I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didnt miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I dont think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasnt that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.And I really didnt think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.I also have to comment on Christian Bales Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I dont get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made. 
Is it really one of the top 10?	7	London, England	There seems to be a lot of hype about this film. As I write its sitting at #6 with an average rating of 9.0. Honestly, I dont think its that good. Heath Ledger is fun as the psychopathic side of the joker, but Im not sure hes any more enjoyable than Jack Nicholson - where, for instance, are the actual jokes? Michael Caine just is NOT Alfred - butlers should speak much more correctly than that, and the cockney boy just doesnt work for me. Christian Bale doesnt seem solid enough as a Bruce Wayne. Its a bit more jolly than the Tim Burton efforts - there is at least daylight this time - and the plot twists and effects are decent, but I dont think theyre particularly ground-breaking. All in all Id say its watchable, but I dont expect it to hang around in the top 10 for too long. 
Really Overrated	1	United States	I know this is pointless since it will be in 3,000 other reviews and no one will ever read it but, whatever. Anyways, on with the review. OK, Ill admit it. When I went and first saw this movie in the theatre, I thought it was amazing. I even did what other people did and started quoting the joker all the time (and good lord did that get burnt out REAL fast.). But then I bought the movie and kind of thought to myself, you know what, I should actually try to analyze this movie as a whole and not just pay attention to one persons performance(aka Heath Ledger.). So I sat down and watched it and I realized. Holy crap this movie is bad, REALLY bad, I did not realize how many plot holes this dang thing had, and the fact that it is in IMDbs top 10 best movies of all time is just insane. Look, Im sorry Christopher Nolan fans but, I have to give you the gods honest truth. This movie is not top 10 worthy. I think the only reason why this movie has such a high rating is because of obsessive Heath Ledger fans and the Christopher Nolan fans who cant stop sucking on his tit. They think he can do no wrong. Well thats what this movie is, wrong. I mean cmon, you Christopher Nolan fans are telling me that you can honestly sit there and tell me this movie is better than these (and yes Dark Knight is currently ranked higher than all these movies I listed.): Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan, Terminator 2, The original Star Wars, American History X, The Lord of the Rings, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, The Matrix, The Silence of the Lambs, Citizen Kane and Full Metal Jacket? No, no, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. Im sorry mister Nolan but, youre obviously really good at brainwashing your fan base. Thats the only explanation Ive got is that Christopher has discovered how to hypnotize people and he can do it very well. Its ratings on movies like this that really make me think about how stupid society is nowadays. Im sorry if I sound a little aggressive in this review but, I honestly feel this movie does not deserve the HUGE spotlight that everyone gave it. 
The Dark Knight Overrated!	1	Australia	I believe if Heath Ledger had been alive this would have been maybe a 7/10 and his acting was good but not great and anyway he played second fiddle to Christian Bales Batman. To be honest I think and have talked to people who think it fantastic and then some that hadnt heard of Ledgers death and interestingly these people gave him about a 6-7/10 for his portrayal of The Joker Whilst Ledger is a great actor and will be sorely missed I think that this being his LAST movie and all the emotion has boosted it up.The same thing happened with James Dean with his blockbuster and last movie Giant. Ledger was a creepy joker and did well to play his part but I think the fact that he was dead made people look at him all throughout the movie and not other actors. Good Move RIP Heath Ledger, a sad loss to the industry 
Kill The Actor	1	New York, NY USA	I think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find The Dark Knight (aka Batman 2) to be a Masterpiece of Contemporary Cinema. Is adorable the right word? Christian Bale reprises his role as the humorless comic-book hero and Heath Ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic-book villain ironically named Joker. Ledgers Joker is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy, which means to say he never laughs, never makes anyone laugh, and never jokes. Are we having fun yet? The film takes place in the same Gotham City from the previous film: flat, bleak, black, dark, foreboding, menacing, pessimistic, intense, sinister, colorless, numb, petrified... is this the fun part? Bale- an otherwise fascinating actor- manages to create a black hole as both Bruce Wayne AND Batman, leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer. Christopher Nolans solemn direction is the same as in the first- hes working so hard to convince us that all of this is ABSOLUTELY REAL that there is no chance for any fun. Fun in a superhero movie? I must be out of my mind.Whats sad is that poor Heath Ledger took the role of Actual Psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the mans death. No film role is worth your life, and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind, youre doing it wrong. No offense to the late actor- whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film- but Jack Nicholson nailed The Joker in 89. It was nice of the Academy to give Ledger the posthumous Oscar, but I think we all would have preferred he not die before his time.This is not to say the movie is terrible... its still an above-average action flick with some nice moments: the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at Waynes cocktail party border on subversive, but the generally dour approach to the popcorn-flick leaves me depressed, and I cant help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this...Maybe thats what certain members of an unspecified generation want... maybe the Imagination is so damaged they dont believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies. I find the death of creative thought rather frightening, and I keep coming back to an old horror catchphrase: Its only a movie, Its only a movie... GRADE: C 
Wow - Mind Blowing Action	10	United States	The Dark Knight was probably the best action film Ive ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledgers best performance from his all too short career.The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesnt use too much face time on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right. 
Disappointed	1	United Kingdom	Ive felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded. My real rating would be about 7/10 but I cant stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list , it wouldnt make my top 100! The plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout.The moral dilemma of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me. Why werent the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it ? would both boats (especially one full of ex-cons) really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others ? Some great scenes, special effects, cinematography, lighting, dark mood etc. Brilliant performance by Heath Ledger but overall the plot let this film down.
