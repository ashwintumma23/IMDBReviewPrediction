The Dark Knight is the worst sequel since Highlander 2: The Quickening. I am dumbfounded at this entry into the franchise that was re-invigorated so wonderfully with Batman Begins. I speak to people frequently about this film and have had little opposition to my views on it, ergo people dont like it. I really think this film is the biggest dupe since The Blair Witch Project. I want to make it clear that I love Batman, Bob Kanes Batman, Frank Millers Batman, Jeph Loebs Batman and the DC Animated Universes Batman. Like many, I found the Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher films excruciating to watch. Batman Begins came along and Christopher Nolan gave us a Batman we could respect and understand as well as believe. We were then teased with The Jokers calling card and ready for what was going to be the meeting of the the most famous adversaries in comic and screen history....and we got....a joker with self applied makeup and no gadgets who is essentially a terrorist, no batcave, a batsuit that looked like a riot cop, a convoluted Scorsese like story about laundered money and a massive emphasis on factionalised and organised crime, a Two-Face whos only motive is a dead girlfriend, a Batman we hardly see, and a Gotham City that now looks like Chicago. But the enigma I cant stomach is that the film HAD NO CLIMAX!!! I asked many viewers what they thought the climax was and there is a different answer each time...oh it was Batman confronting Dent...no it was the Joker hanging upside down, no it was Rachel Dawes being killed.....NO there was no climax! This films success lies only in the sad fact that its main antagonist was played by an actor who died during the promotional phase of the film. In Nolans attempt to legitimise the Batman mythos he has made it sterile and boring.	1
First let me say that this movie does not deserve only one star. My real rating would be a six to an eight (depending on your taste in movies) but I had to compensate.Compensate for what? Well, literary device, Im glad you asked. Toolsthe answer is tools. No, not instruments used to construct objects or to do maintenance work around the house such as a hammer or screw driver. Im talking about people, people who are easily swayed by other peoples opinions and by mass marketing campaigns. Unfortunately, almost everyone in America (including myself) is subject to tooldom from time to time so we can really only judge others based on the extent and frequency to which a person is a tool. Now I realize that these tools sound pretty scary so here is a trick you can use to spot and avoid the biggest of these flaming idiots. If they have ever given The Dark Knight 10/10 stars or referred to it as one of/the greatest movies of all time well then Lil Miss Daisy Im afraid you have a huge tool on your hands. I recommend immediate euthanasia.Why this movie is not up to par is covered thoroughly in other negative reviews, I simply felt the need to explain why there are so many overwhelmingly positive reviews. Its quite simple really. The media told everyone they should likeso they did. These people then went out and told their friends that they should like itso they did. And these friends then went out and told other friends that they should like itso they did. So it went until one day TDK topped the list of IMDbs greatest movies of all time. What it boils down to is that this is your basic super hero movie that got really good media coverage. Had the initial media coverage been negative and Heath Ledger (God rest his soul) not died at an unfortunately opportunistic time for Hollywood this never would of happened. Basically what Im saying is someone told you this movie was good, so you went into it with a positive attitude and were willing to ignore some of the flaws. And while the revelation that going into something with a positive attitude will make the experience better for you might not surprise you or anyone else on the planet I feel that the warm fuzzy feeling towards this movie has gotten to a point of excess. Too many people told you it was good. You went into it with too positive an attitude and you ignored too many of the flaws. This movies current average (9/10) is absurd and a perfect example of why all my scathing comments about tools in the previous paragraph are justified. Its an OK movie and a good movie if you like action movies and are willing to ignore glaring plot holes like the villain spitting in the face of physics and being able to do or be anything anywhere at any time he wanted.	1
Good cinematography and special effects makes a perfect movie??? Well, according to most people, I guess so. But for people like me (unfortunately there arent too many of us individual-minded thinkers left), it takes a good STORY to lure us in. To me, this movie tried noticeably hard to pack everything together and failed... of course unless good cinematography and special effects gives you a hard on. A way-overdone story with an unrealistic genius villain loaded with shattering glass and more shattering glass is what I got out of it. One thing after another made me feel like I was watching Batman: The Law  Order Miniseries. Oh yeah, for one of the best, if not the best movie of all time, this thing didnt leave me in awe for a second or raise the hair on my arm one bit like so many movies with a believable, likable story. Funny to think how well this film would have done if you could take away lets see... the cinematography and special effects.	1
Instead of questioning Capitalism, Communism, Taoism or Existentialism... and challenging the audience... it is about corruption and surrendering to corruption like surrendering to jaded teen boredom. Fueled by the claustrophobic helplessness due to terrorism, and the merciless acceptance of hipster nihilism, TDK is a cold unrealistic mechanical set-up sold over and over again by its proponents as ultra-realistic. That is the most frightening thing about the obsessive if not immoral blatherings of TDK fans is the Emperors New Clothes insistence that the film represents realism. From the Jokers precision timing to drive a school bus into a line of school buses, with one space left for him... to Dents facial damage due to 5 seconds of burning gasoline... the film is rife with movie fakeness sold like Ad (or ADD) pitchmen for Nolans formulaic realism, which is actually just him stealing from The Long Halloween.A meaningless Rube Goldberg contraption, Nolan takes the audience on an endless set of fake-out twists and turns to deliver very little but loud moments. As calculated and obsessive as The Joker is, and to the degree he plans about 5 separate back up plans that come to fruition, he enters the level of anal retentive... yet somehow we are to believe he is some agent of chaos. Which, means cool. Chaos = cool, get it? Theres nothing cool or chaotic about this drugged out riffing Joker, and as fun as Ledger makes him, he overshadows what should have been the center of the story: Harvey Dent. But its Batman so, business as usual... problem child villain acts up, makes a mess, BatDad shows up to clean up the mess. Crowd applauds. Unfortunately what the film creates is a subtext of a NeoCon wetdream with by any means necessary militarism, where the Batman uses unethical means to detect the Joker, and we are to assume this fall from grace makes him heroic because he is banished and falsely accused (for 1 minute of nagging by the Joker, turning Dent evil for yet another film coincidence) of driving Dent from white to dark knight... so Batman takes the blame and is the dark knight cuz hes just a Christ figure. So our sacrificial Justice League hero is supposed to be a sympathetic figure of crossing moral boundaries to save society... George Bush must have loved this puppy. Not sure half the tween tards watching this caught that bit of hooey, but as much as the poster art evokes Fight Club, this film is about as far from punk anarchy as you can get. Maybe they should all be sent to military school if this is their idea of rebellion.	1
After I was done watching this movie, I was sitting there waiting for it to begin. There was no story. There was nothing for viewers to hope to happen or not to happen. Unbearably trite performances all around. Can Morgan Freeman play anything other than Morgan Freeman? I was waiting for the scene when he tells Batman that he is really God and that Batman has to be God for a day, i.e. Batman Almighty.Were given no reason to care about anything that happens to any of the characters. This was a classic example of weak screen and story writing covered up by special effects, explosions, and other eye candy. The only thing redeeming about it was some decent ambiance and directing, but in that regard, it did not live up to Batman Begins. Nolan is past the point in his career where he has something to prove. The love is gone and its showing in a big way.The Batmobile was fun to watch, but that hardly makes a movie.Please look past the special effects and give this movie the rating it deserves. Make Nolan and other film-makers do more than throw gobs of money at ILM to make a movie.	1
This is one of the worst movies ever made. If you think that it will be as good a the original I urge you to never watch this. Heaths over the top ridiculous performance as the joker was not Oscar worthy, but they gave it to him because he died and robbed him in Brokeback Mountain. The use of the Harvey character was pathetic and Christian Bale is one of the wost actors to ever play Batman. His Bruce Wayne is the only redeeming quality of the movie, other than Gary Oldman as commissioner Gordan. The whole movie is trying to be more epic than it is and this leads to a terrible storyline and pathetic use of special effects. I would recommend watching the original batman with Michael Keaton any day. Dont waste your time with this crap written by Nolan, he is a hack. Unless you like Batman sounding like he is Satan... dont watch this film	1
Ridiculously overrated, monumentally disappointing.Whoa, IMDb wont let me post this. Its too short, obviously.Well, then let me tell you this - I never cared for the re-franchising of Batman. Its just more of the Hollywood-style money making. And the more money they put into a film and its promotion, the more hype they create. But it sadly isnt just about them wanting us all to go see the movie. No, they get really greedy and after a certain point is reached, they proclaim this same movie is a piece of art.Its that simple. And if you can succeed in believing it is, it makes your life easier and jollier. You go to IMDb.com, you give it a 10, you read some exuberantly positive comments and smile contentedly, you read some unfavourable ones and mutter to yourself that there are always idiots who just dont get it, and youre happy, cause millions of people are desperately trying to prove to each other that they are part of something bigger than life, and are succeeding in that endeavour, and you are one of them.Not me, guys, not me. I like a lot of stupid films, but not this one. It makes me sick, for it reminds me how gullible we all are and just how much we want to dream. But we only want the dreams to come on the big screen - this is one of the many possible ways, kindly provided by our great benefactors, we can spend our ugly dollars on something shiny and new and inspiring, and harmless. And easy to digest.So, be happy, eat your popcorn, feel nice, eat well after the movie, sleep tight, dream beautifully, but dont bother trying to wake up, cause we are all in a really comfortable place and waking up will be very painful. On the other hand, the dream factory could keep you contented by offering you another piece of art for 10$ or thereabouts. Kudos to our benefactors and encore!	1
Im so relieved that Im not the only one who doesnt think this movie is great. I saw this first in the theater, and to be honest, probably wouldve given it a bit higher rating...if I wouldve reviewed it then. But........I just watched it again on cable and it doesnt hold up as well outside of the movie theater with its huge screen, dark room and loud speakers. First off...what I liked. Heath Leadger was fantastic as the Joker and couldve done so much more with it if the writing and plot had been better. The movie shouldve focused on a battle of wits and balls between Batman and Joker. That wouldve been more interesting. I liked Morgan Freeman. I enjoy his character. I like that there wasnt some big distracting relationship for Batman/Bruce. I even enjoyed some of the explosions. I hate Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce. He just doesnt emote anything. Also...HE HAS THE WORST BATMAN VOICE EVER....EVER....EVER!!!! The movie was way too long and had way too many subplots going. I couldve lived without the whole Harvey Dent thing. Why introduce Two Face just to kill him off? It made no sense. Then again, a lot of the subplots made no sense. The movie takes itself too seriously. Theres really no humor either. I realize the whole idea was to make it dark, but sheesh, cmon. There were too many just shoved in there explosions going on. It felt like two movies being rammed into one. Its just too much. Too many things going on that dont really gel together. I guess Im tired of movies that offer more in explosions and chases than solid story telling and characters you can give a damn about. I honestly could not sit through this movie again. If I do anything, Ill watch it free on demand and fast forward to the Heath Leadger scenes. He did so much with what he was given to work with.....which wasnt any where near what it could have been. All in all...this movie doesnt live up to the hype.	5
Although an average film, Batman Begins had a dark, brooding quality and got off to an interesting start about the origins of the caped crusader before turning dreary. Unfortunately, this followup takes up right where the previous one left off - still dark but also dreary and even sillier. The script is atrocious and the plot line involving Two-Face is unbelievably lame. The most interesting thing in this tiresome film is the mesmerizing farewell performance from Ledger. He is simply fun to watch as the Joker. All the other actors look bored, a result of Nolans dull direction. At a length of two and a half hours, it seriously overstays its welcome. Time to make Batman Ends.	4
This is the future comic book adaptations are headed? THEN WATCH...ME..GO. What a sucker punch. I had such a big hopes (mostly because of the hype created by people who invested millions into this flop), that it really hurts me to say, the biggest disappointment in 2008 was this movie. (Although, I still cant say it was the worst) There is nobody I can warn about this movie since I was probably the last person to see it on the earth, But-Man, to see a great franchise falling this low?! Millions of dollars spent on this movie, could have ended the poverty on this world, and I couldnt see anything to justify the spending. For example the bat-cave, in this movie is an undecorated, plain, underground garage. Fhuy!! Batman costumes always were lacking behind other super heros outfit, however for what they used here, I have to admit I seen better on some kids showing up at my doorstep for Halloween. Not to mention it was so uncomfortable that Christian B. couldnt even move properly in it,(heck, he couldnt even speak properly in it), so all the fight scenes were TERRIBLE, hidden in dark or under a stroboscope light. How about the gay cowboy licking his mouth every 5 seconds, scary? try Retarded (No offense) Imitating raw home made camera footage, once invented by Blair Witch Project, in a News-break part was when I almost smashed my TV. (Again, where the money went in this film???????????????????????)Ill tell You where. Paying all the critics for a few favorable words. Shame, on You Hollywood.Sure, Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher versions were Over-The-Top, But-Man, did I love their use of colors and mood, it was a visual treat.Dark Knight: was it a bad movie?, No, it wasnt. Disappointment? You betchaa!Long Live Jack Nicholson.	4
I was very disappointed with this movie. I made the error of watching it, based on the high score it is recording in the reviews on the IMDb. I could quite easily have given it away after 15-20 minutes, but I persevered with it.I only persevered for one reason, I wanted to see what was probably Heath Ledgers last complete performance. I rated his performance very highly and he deserves to be considered for any of the upcoming awards shows, truly on merit.I thought that Christian Bale was miscast and unconvincing, as Batman and there really wasnt very much of a story line to the movie. I cannot understand how this is rated a 9 out of 10 at present. That must mean, that all reviewers are between 18-30 and you are all giving it nine or ten. Ten being the perfect score for the perfect movie, I think some of you have let your emotions get away with you.I scored it 5 out of 10.	5
The Batsuit can deflect bullets, but it cant withstand a dog attack? Holy Wardrobe Malfunction! If I were Bruce Wayne, I would have kicked Morgan Freemans backside back to The Electric Company, and sued the crap out of the firm that made the material that was supposed to protect my richer-than-God self from the likes of Cujo! But then, that would make way too much sense, and sense is something that the Batman franchise has never been accused of having!Say what you will about Tim Burtons and Joel Schumachers Batman movies: at least they never pretended to be anything other than silly popcorn flicks. Christopher Nolan, on the other hand, wants to be Ingmar Bergman when he grows up -- which is why he rips off Burton! Dont tell me that ridiculous standoff was a happy accident, Ledger grunting Come on, come on, hit me  la Jack? Batman doesnt turn The Joker into roadkill because he has a moral code? Give me a break! And, for a self-proclaimed agent of chaos, every one of The Jokers actions are oddly well-planned and executed. Memo to Nolan: look up chaos in the dictionary!Which leads me to Ledger. Since when does twitching like a coked-up Mexican jumping bean constitute acting? No disrespect, but lets be real: if he hadnt died, that truly morbid Oscar campaign wouldnt have sprung up, and he wouldnt have been nominated, much less, won. As I could never understand Ledger half the time because none of his directors had the balls to tell him to enunciate like a normal human being, he had to have been dubbed, because I actually understood every word he said!And its close to the vest, NOT close to the chest! Idiots!	2
The Dark Knights extreme popularity must be due to saturation advertising, hype, the popularity of the Batman franchise, and a star-studded cast. Looked at objectively, it fails on a number of levels.SPOILER WARNING: This comment talks extensively about the plot of the movie.A) The script is full of illogical events. 1) Batman jumps out of a window on the 50th floor to rescue Rachel, catches her, and smashes with her onto a car in the street below, and they both walk away unscathed, despite the fact that no parachutes were deployed and no wings broke their fall. 2) The Joker somehow fills large places throughout the city with large oil canisters full of explosives, with no one seeing, including Gothams largest hospital and two ferry boats, after advertising that these places would be targeted. 3) Midway through the movie, the white knight of justice, District Attorney Harvey Dent, does a 180 degree turn when his girlfriend is killed and becomes a psychotic killer, for no reason whatsoever. 4) Early in the movie, the Joker goes on a rampage and then makes demands and the entire city clamors not for his defeat but for all his demands to be met. 5) Dogs can bite through the bulletproof bat suit. 6) Two Rottweilers can take down and immobilize Batman. 7) The Joker can singlehandedly overpower Batman without any weapons. 8) The police act as buffoons throughout the movie: they put the Joker in a cell with other prisoners; interrogate him without handcuffs; let him out of the interrogation room when he takes the interrogator hostage; and give him a cell phone to use, which he then uses to trigger an explosion in the building that kills everyone but, miraculously, him. 9) The Joker drives alongside a police caravan and systematically picks off one police car after another with a bazooka, and the police continue driving along at the same plodding pace. 10) Batman shoots at the Joker and fights him and flips his 18-wheeler truck, but when he is about to hit the Joker with his motorcycle, he crashes it instead and puts himself at the mercy of the Joker in a fit of GI Joe morality. 11) Morgan Freeman objects to Batmans cell phone mapping technique, saying Too much power for one man, and resigns as his assistant, despite Batmans lifelong pursuit of lawless vigilantism.B) Aesthetically the movie is unimaginative and uninspiring. 1) Batman as a fighter is stiff. His suit is like a slab of sheet metal welded together. His movement is the opposite of the smooth, flowing martial artist one sees in classic samurai or judo movies. Batman arrives without stealth, by smashing through windows into hails of gunfire, and departs in a similarly unstealthy manner. This is the opposite of how a ninja would behave: with intelligence, grace, simplicity, and secrecy. Similarly, the Batmobile smashes through reinforced concrete walls and sits still to absorb a hail of gunfire. The Batman envisioned here -- smashing everything in his path, and indestructible -- is more like the Incredible Hulk than a bat. 2) Set design is drab. The scene in the kitchen, of the conference of mafiosi, is plain, uninspired, and unimaginative. The parking garage scene is aesthetically dull. The bat cave is quite plain -- just a long, empty room with a low, internally lit ceiling, without any gear whatsoever.C) The casting is poor and the acting uninspired and sloppy. 1) Morgan Freeman is a dreadful choice. His acting and presence is like the feel-good music that often accompanies his scenes. Just play the music and skip him. 2) Aaron Eckhart relies too much on his good looks and smile and not enough on acting. He sounds like a motivational speaker -- that is, a liar -- trying to convince, but unconvincing. His body language in the scene on top of the building is very fake: amateur-aggressive. 3) The actor playing Commissioner Gordon is about as good as a director standing in for an actor who couldnt make it to rehearsal. He has no energy or presence on screen. I appreciate understatement in acting, but he seems to be half asleep and mumbles his way through his lines. 4) Maggie Gyllenhaal is unconvincing as the object of desire of both heroes. 5) The black mafia boss is terrible. The other mafia bosses are not much better: overacting without direction or intelligence. 6) The man who turns from a meek bank supervisor to a tough vigilante in the first scene is too self-conscious, and his transition is unbelievable. He is too recognizable as an actor. 7) The acting by extras is very bad and poorly directed. When the Joker says half, the chorus of laughter is like that in a high school musical. The same unanimity of action is found at the press conference. The thugs in the parking garage seem like models, not thugs.D) The editing is too fast; transitions are largely dispensed with altogether. 1) There is no pause before the cut to the trial; dialogue from the two scenes runs together. 2) The scene at the benefit party is unconvincing: Bruce Wayne drops the models immediately, people applaud immediately, its over. Scenes are too fast and perfunctory.E) In its larger themes, the movie proves to be just as illogical and perplexing as in its minutest details. The end of the movie carries this message: Sometimes the truth isnt good enough ... Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. This is used to justify the creation of a myth of Harvey Dent as Savior Of Gotham, and to explain the need for making Batman the fall guy for all of Dents crimes. However, the movie makes no attempt to explain why Dent, the psychopath, should be eulogized and not Batman, the hero. The writer floats a thesis about the human need for myths on a raft of unpersuasive evidence.	1
bad parts of this movie:--The action scenes sucked, other than at the beginning. -The action scenes consisted of the joker saying something stupid, batman hitting him, the joker hitting him back and then walking away, and something exploding -In a good movie, the good guy is supposed to be a little weaker than the bad guy and has to overcome it, but batman has radar vision and can fly while the joker has nothing but a knife-This movie was not inspiring. What does it inspire me to do? Pay a British douche a lot of money so I can dress up in robotic bat suits and catch criminals.Speaking of the bat suit: -If part of batmans sacrifice is that the city hates him then WHY DOES HE HAVE A SPECIAL UNIFORM? If youre supposed to be hated by everyone, wear a ski mask and stop advertising yourself. If you are trying to be loved by the people, then you can advertise.-The movie created so many dumb unimportant plot lines and nothing ended up happening. Right after the love triangle, the girl died. That guy said he was gonna reveal batmans identity, but nothing happens.--There was so much that didnt make any sense. -How does one guy in Hong Kong do the accounting for all the criminals in Gotham? -Why is it the biggest problem in the world that 5 people were killed in 5 days? Thats better than things are usually in big cities. -Why dont the gangsters the joker is talking to kidnap him? etc.-The joker wasnt creepy. There is nothing creepy about a guy wandering around in face paint and giggling. If he walked in to a bar, cut a guys head off, and then ordered a salad, that would be creepy.-A superhero should be a superhero because he did something cool. Batman is a superhero just because hes rich.good parts: -The credits.	1
It is odd to spend more than two hours watching a film and it slowly dawns on you that you are not particularly bothered how it ends and, if anything, rather wish it would end sooner rather than later. The Dark Knight is that kind of film. Exactly why I lost interest or even when, Im not too sure, but lose interest I did. This is Christopher Nolans second stab at Batman as well as Christian Rant Bales, and although all the elements are there, it is simply not as good. Naturally, this being another slug, blast and punchfest - tho despite its reputation for being dark, thankfully not a bloodfest - many, many viewers have lauded this as a masterpiece, the best movie of 2008 so far, far surpasses Begins. No, it isnt and no it doesnt. All I can say is that these people have not seen many masterpieces or many films in 2008. The Dark Knight, in that way which Hollywood has made its sugary own, attempts to flatter the audience by including a moral dilemma and it does so not once, but rather often. This time we are invited - the we being the popcorn-chewing Saturday night crowd who think thought is a luxury - to reflect on moral ambiguity and how relative rather than absolute the notions of good and evil can be. And each time this viewer sighed a little: as the saying goes, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. We get any number of high falutin speeches about heroes and villains but, in truth, is just so much codswallop. In truth this film is just another blockbuster, and, at that, it is not even as good as many other blockbusters. If you want to meditate on the reality of good and evil, of heroes and villains, by all means make a film doing so, but in The Dark Knight it is all, for this viewer at least, all very phoney. Apart from that, this film is a tad confusing, there are too many characters, the plot, or at least what there is of it, really does not bear repeating, the suspense is curiously unexciting, and too often the film drags. The old actors are there, and all with the very honourable exception of the late Heath Ledger, seem to be acting by numbers. (This was, I think, Ledgers last film, and his early death is sad. Undoubtedly he was very talented.) And having said all that, there is not much more to say. Its not bad, its not particularly good. As part of the series, it stands tall, but then the series is not all that outstanding. See it if you want to, and if, after reading this, you decide not to, well, sorry, but you wont be missing much at all.	5
This movie was so wildly praised by critics and fans alike that it was hard not to have somewhat diminished expectations. It cant be *that* great, right? Right.I cant say this is a bad movie, just not a very interesting one. It begins promisingly with a superbly executed set piece, with the Joker staging a daring bank robbery. This is a very nicely done action sequence, and Heath Ledgers Joker does indeed live up to the hype. Its a genuinely strange characterization, and the story built around it should work.After that, the movie starts to drag. There are far too many long, talky sequences, followed by the usual slam-bang action scenes that are shot from a distance so you cant see whats really going on. Whats really missing from the action is any sense of a story; theres just more of the same that you usually see in a superhero picture. Been there, done that.Another fatal mistake is one that happens far too often: too many villains. This was a major problem with the 90s Batman films: you have to squeeze the Penguin and Catwoman and Christopher Walken into one film, with no time left for anything like character development. In this movie, the focus is on the Joker, but thats not enough: we have Two-Face into the mix (who only becomes Two-Face at the two-hour mark, leaving only a short time for him to be dispatched by our hero).Two-Face was my favorite of the old Batman Rogues Gallery, and he deserved a story all his own. Throwing him in as an afterthought to the Joker (particularly when Ledgers scenery chewing overshadows everything else in the picture, including Batman) both makes the film far too long, and blunts its impact.Lost somewhere in all this is Batman, who almost seems absent from the picture. Although he has to make a tragic choice, there seems to be no character development, and Bales performance is practically phoned in. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman contribute their customary gravitas, but again this just adds to the extreme length of the picture.Batman Begins was a strong picture, and Im puzzled as to what Im missing here. I saw this on Blu-Ray and found myself reaching for the remote every ten minutes or so, to see how much longer I was going to have to watch this. I finally hit Stop by accident at 2 hrs., but decided to just let it go. This movie failed to engage my interest on any level and I just wanted it to end.	3
A touch of reality is much-needed for those who of late have occupied themselves in tossing about bon-mots like masterpiece and crime-epic. Perhaps never before have the expectations of rabid fanboys so completely bullied the critics into sheer lying. For lying it must be, since I refuse to believe that the critics did not see through this. It is just not possible. I feel that most of them simply cowed down before the staggering pre-release fanboy blitzkrieg, rather than provoke the inevitable backlash of acrimony from fans and thereby needlessly risk their careers. This is the only explanation I can conceive of as to why TDK has seemingly scored so well with the critics. I dont blame the critics, though. The blame lies in the fanboys hysteria : their myopic refusal to see the obvious.I feel that Chris Nolan tried really really hard to make a good film, but ultimately even he with all his skill cant do much simply because of the limitations of the genre. If viewers truly want more realism as they say they do, then why turn to comics in the first place ?? Its just amazing how comic-book junkies pull the wool over their own eyes and deceive themselves into thinking that what they read is deep and sophisticated, when in fact (and there cannot be two opinions on this) reading comics beyond a certain age is a sign of neurotic behaviour. And before you shove it in my face that it is ME who is taking it too seriously, let me just say that this movie was nothing but lashes of violence : grim, sadistic violence. Once again, the so-called realism is simply a pretext for the usual action-movie gang-banging, i.e. violence and special effects. And its not even just because of the genre : Batman Begins rose above those limitations, right ? One could empathize with the young Bruce Wayne, tormented by his perceived culpability in his parents murder, and struggling with his anger and loneliness. Not so in TDK : here there is neither plot nor motivation to speak of, and not a single character with whom one can even remotely identify. The acting, apart from one notable performance, is mediocre. To be fair, the film does take certain risks which I cant imagine the likes of, say, a Sam Raimi ever taking ; it isnt a McDonaldized blockbuster to the degree that the Spiderman films and the rest of the comic-book parade are. The problem is that those risks dont pay off : instead of an even progression of events that build up to a crescendo, what you get here is one absurdity after another until you are numb and it no longer matters who is doing what.I wonder if it is really so hard to tell the truth, even only to oneself. Apparently it is indeed SO difficult for all the fanboys to own up that the countless hours spent over the last several months, sitting up nights staring at their monitors and devouring every last bit of inconsequential trivia about TDK, have all amounted to a huge nothing. TDK is the prime example of how the advertising business works today, hyping up a product during pre-release to uncalled-for heights and ultimately forcing the gullible consumer to like the product against his better judgement. The marketing behind this film is very much THE phenomenal success story of this decade, and should serve as a de-facto case study for anyone who wants to understand just exactly how mob psychology works.EDIT : A more appropriate rating for this film is 4/10. But I so deeply despise Warner Bros.  the people lauding this film (i.e. everyone except me) that I must give it 1/10, just to balance things.	1
I was not expecting this film to live up to the hype, but it didnt even come close to living up to my lowered expectations. I give it 3 stars only for Heath Ledgers performance, which was very original and nicely done, but still not deserving of the rave reviews it has been receiving. Even his excellent performance was brought down by the horrible script he had to work with.Its all been said before, but:- The acting of every cast member except for Heith Ledger was wooden and utterly boring.- The Batman character was unsympathetic and had none of the appeal that was built up in Batman Begins of a tormented soul nonetheless trying to do good. In this film he is both boring, nasty, and indecisive.- Every fight scene was mechanical, unoriginal, shot in dim lighting, and used none of the stealth that Batman is supposed to use.- Batmans voice was laughable and got worse as the film dragged on.- Way too many convoluted and disconnected subplots to keep track of. I had no idea where the story was going at any point in time, and didnt care. I watched this on DVD and started fast-forwarding through large chunks about 2 hours into the movie; should have done this sooner.- Every character spouted sophomoric monologues about good and evil that were unconvincing. A good script gets these messages across using the plot and actions of the characters, not through monologues.- The Jokers various schemes and escapes were impossible to believe even in the context of a comic good movie. How could the Joker walk into a hospital, with full makeup on, and walk right up to Harvey Dent, who is unguarded, *after* the Joker has already kidnapped and disfigured Dent once, *and* the Joker has announced he is going to attack a hospital? This kind of thing happened countless times. I love comic book movies (e.g., Xmen 1 & 2, Iron Man), but in the good ones you can believe that the events would actually happen within the context of the fantasy world of the story.- The love triangle story felt tacked-on. What in the story showed you that Bruce Wayne and Rachel, or Harvey Dent and Rachel, had any affection for each other? You are just supposed to accept all of this without any effort by the scriptwriters or actors.- The Joker has an endless crew of henchmen, but why would any criminal agree to work for the Joker after he assassinates his entire crew in the first scene? Why would any criminal agree to work for him if his goal is just to cause chaos and not to earn money, and he burns all the money he earns? Dont criminals normally want to get money out of risking their lives to commit crimes?- Two and a half hours is way too long. An hour could have been cut without missing it. Compare this to any truly great movie (Gandhi, Godfather 1 & 2), where several hours just fly by.- The scriptwriters couldnt decide whether to make this a realistic drama or a comic book for the screen. So they flip-flopped back and forth. Case in point: a witness on the stand pulls out a gun, Harvey Dent disarms him, and then wants to continue examining the witness. This is slapstick and is impossible to swallow if we are supposed to believe this is the real world, but it could work if the whole movie set a comic book tone in which ridiculous things like this happen. But it didnt, so the inconsistencies are just jarring. At least the Tim Burton films -- and even the campy 1960s Batman TV show! -- created an internally consistent world.- I was ready for the movie to be over, when in comes a whole separate story about Two Face. It was completely out of place with whatever plot arc still existed at that point. Plus, the transformation of Harvey Dents character into Two Face made no sense, as did his ability to survive a car-flipping accident. Then we witness him shoot Batman, who we have already seen surviving hundreds of bullets without a scratch, and we are supposed to be surprised when Batman leaps up again, unharmed?I could write another whole review just listing more plot holes.Again, I am a big fan of comic book movies and even enjoyed Batman Begins, but this was a real loser.	3
This movie is seriously over hyped crap. From a completely technical view it has some merits. Its well filmed, the shots and cutting are phenomenal. The plot has some merit although there was a whole of one thing I didnt see coming throughout the whole film. The one scene I enjoyed is on the boats, a deep look into humanitys fragile tempers. Christian Bale is terrible in his role of batman. His voice is so forced, he makes it way too gravelly and just botches the whole thing. He allows absolutely no subtlety and the love story angle is so contrived. God he was terrible. Oooh now we get to the poster boy Heath Ledger... OK I do have to grant that he did a fairly good job in his portrayal of the joker, his lines are well delivered and his acting is good. But this idea that he is now the holy grail of acting is just stupid. He died so now everyone feels like they cant critique him. When did death make you amazing? Fine then Hitler was a saint cause he died, we arent allowed to say he messed up.... ever. He did a good job but there have been far better actors. I feel the writing was almost as important to the character as his acting, doesnt matter how good you act if the writing sucks the movie sucks. On to a one Aaron Eckhart, decent acting. Far better in Thank you for smoking but thats besides the point. I dont have much to say other than he started really strong and finished off pretty weak. After one of the plot twists his acting just gets mediocre.All in all this movie would have been really good, I mean phenomenal if it werent for all of the hype around it. I saw it in theaters a day or so after opening and enjoyed it.... until about the 4 millionth why so serious? half an hour after it was over. It was good but it belongs in maybe the low hundreds on the top 250 list not top 10.	1
The Dark Knight is an extraordinary mish-mash lacking logic and cohesion.Technically, the film is well made. That is, it looks and feels like a blockbuster, though a solid score is sorely lacking.On the plus side, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman add gravitas to an otherwise ordinary ensemble.And sadly, a fine actor will be remembered, not for the likes of moving and sensitive performances seen in Brokeback Mountain and Candy, but rather an excellent make-up job, an over-active tongue and a silly voice. As farewell performances rate, Heath Ledgers Joker sits alongside Peter Sellers Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu.To remind yourself how super hero movies should be made, dust off your copy of Spiderman II (from which it borrows) or Superman The Movie (from which it shouldve borrowed).	5
Time for a corrective. As I write this review, The Dark Knight is, according to IMDb voters, the Best. Film. Ever. At the risk of incurring a hail of brickbats, I must demur. Yes, Heath Ledger delivers an excellent performance, as does Gary Oldman as Lieutenant--er, COMMISSIONER Gordon--and its always a pleasure to watch Michael Caine and Aaron Eckhart. But The Dark Knight is an overlong, over plotted, logically flawed, and philosophically confused film that cannot (and should not) be mistaken for great art. Compared to most comic book movies, its not bad. Compared to La Regle du Jeu, it aint so hot. The films first half is actually quite good, and seems to come to a timely conclusion somewhere around the eighty minute mark. Unfortunately, this being a summer blockbuster, theres another 70 plus minutes to go, and the films second half is a distinct letdown. Instead of ending on a neat and tidy note, The Dark Knight spirals off into a muddled mess of bizarre plotting (how DID that prisoner get the bomb sewn into him?), illogic (how does Harvey escape the hospital explosion--and why is he apparently impervious to pain?) and confusing action (too many ass-kickings in too little time). I dont expect 100% logical consistency from my genre product, but there are so many flaws and elisions of simple common sense in Christopher Nolans screenplay that utter frustration sets in around the two-hour mark. By the end of the film, were expected to believe that, for some reason, the residents of Gotham now need to revile Batman rather than reward him for his good work, setting up a police pursuit into the sunset that presumably will end with our hero receiving a ticket for speeding on the Batcycle. So lets tell it like it is: in terms of 2008 comic book flicks, The Dark Knight is inferior to both Hellboy II (which at least is charming and amusing) and Hancock (which raises far more interesting questions about the nature of the super hero).	5
Before walking into this movie , i really had great expectations, what with the rave reviews the movie was being lavished with and the seemingly awesome trailer. And then came the moment of truth,the movie was very ordinary. I saw nothing special in this movie for me to even remotely praise it. It was long, many gaps in the plot in addition to scenes and story lines which seemed senseless and had no follow -up. Plus, there really was nothing artistic about it and it didnt actually have the enjoyable cinematic experience moviegoers would want to relish in. This was further aggravated with the poor lines in the film. In short the movie didnt get me all excited or sucked me into it. Throughout the entire film I was hardly able to connect to the film. That said however I wouldnt recommend folks to not watch it but just an advice to keep your hopes to a minimal point.	1
Well here it is, one of the most anticipated movies of the year so far. How was it? It was excellent. By far the best Batman film ever made and of course it will be one of the most memorable action films for a long while.Everyone was waiting to see how well Heath Ledger performed as The Joker in this film. He definitely deserves an Oscar in his honor. The character was so dark and creepy that it sent chills up my back. Compared to Heaths other films like 10 Things I Hate About You and even Brokeback Mountain proves that this man could actually act, doesnt matter what character, he could do it.The films storyline has many twists and all are rewarding, the story is developed constantly after each scene, making you wonder whats next. Excellent craft and flows well towards the conclusion.During the film on the scene with Batman against the Joker, Bike vs Truck. People thought this was the ending. No, it kept going which was awesome, the story kept getting darker and darker, I guess thats why they called it the Dark Knight as well as the relation to Batman himself.The cast was great. With Christopher Nolan playing Batman, good performance, Heath Ledger played extremely well, Maggie was annoying at times, but still deserves to be praised. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had minor roles which satisfied the audiences. Aaron Eckhart starts with a minor role which slowly progresses and becomes evil which is quite surprising and entertaining to watch.Great directing made the movie enjoyable, they added more action this time which made the film feel powerful, lighting was done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Faces face in the many moods he displayed.Great explosions made it entertaining. Made you feel great that this is finally the best action to come in a long time.This movie deserves a 10/10 rating and credit on behalf of the great young actor Heath Ledgers life. (May he R.I.P) His performance made what this film is right now.I recommend this film for any action fan, especially a Batman fan. Or if your even a Heath Ledger fan. Go ahead right now and see this film. Its great!	10
I really wanted to see this in the theater;however, I never did last summer. Instead I waited till it came on cable, and after watching it; I really didnt miss anything by not going to the theater. I was rather disappointed because I was expecting this to be as good as Spiderman, but I dont think it was. I thought it was rather slow moving with sparse action scenes. I mean Batman on the chopper really wasnt that much action. A lot of films have had better car chasing scenes then that.And I really didnt think Heath Ledger was anything special in this. His role was just a lot of hype. Probably the best role was by Aaron Eckhart and the special effects with his face at the end.I also have to comment on Christian Bales Batman voice. What was he trying to do?? He sounded like a chronic smoker with emphysema.FINAL VERDICT: It was good, just not as good as advertised. I dont get why so many people thought it was the best comic book movie to be made.	7
There seems to be a lot of hype about this film. As I write its sitting at #6 with an average rating of 9.0. Honestly, I dont think its that good. Heath Ledger is fun as the psychopathic side of the joker, but Im not sure hes any more enjoyable than Jack Nicholson - where, for instance, are the actual jokes? Michael Caine just is NOT Alfred - butlers should speak much more correctly than that, and the cockney boy just doesnt work for me. Christian Bale doesnt seem solid enough as a Bruce Wayne. Its a bit more jolly than the Tim Burton efforts - there is at least daylight this time - and the plot twists and effects are decent, but I dont think theyre particularly ground-breaking. All in all Id say its watchable, but I dont expect it to hang around in the top 10 for too long.	7
I know this is pointless since it will be in 3,000 other reviews and no one will ever read it but, whatever. Anyways, on with the review. OK, Ill admit it. When I went and first saw this movie in the theatre, I thought it was amazing. I even did what other people did and started quoting the joker all the time (and good lord did that get burnt out REAL fast.). But then I bought the movie and kind of thought to myself, you know what, I should actually try to analyze this movie as a whole and not just pay attention to one persons performance(aka Heath Ledger.). So I sat down and watched it and I realized. Holy crap this movie is bad, REALLY bad, I did not realize how many plot holes this dang thing had, and the fact that it is in IMDbs top 10 best movies of all time is just insane. Look, Im sorry Christopher Nolan fans but, I have to give you the gods honest truth. This movie is not top 10 worthy. I think the only reason why this movie has such a high rating is because of obsessive Heath Ledger fans and the Christopher Nolan fans who cant stop sucking on his tit. They think he can do no wrong. Well thats what this movie is, wrong. I mean cmon, you Christopher Nolan fans are telling me that you can honestly sit there and tell me this movie is better than these (and yes Dark Knight is currently ranked higher than all these movies I listed.): Schindlers List, Saving Private Ryan, Terminator 2, The original Star Wars, American History X, The Lord of the Rings, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, The Matrix, The Silence of the Lambs, Citizen Kane and Full Metal Jacket? No, no, no, no, no, no, absolutely not. Im sorry mister Nolan but, youre obviously really good at brainwashing your fan base. Thats the only explanation Ive got is that Christopher has discovered how to hypnotize people and he can do it very well. Its ratings on movies like this that really make me think about how stupid society is nowadays. Im sorry if I sound a little aggressive in this review but, I honestly feel this movie does not deserve the HUGE spotlight that everyone gave it.	1
I believe if Heath Ledger had been alive this would have been maybe a 7/10 and his acting was good but not great and anyway he played second fiddle to Christian Bales Batman. To be honest I think and have talked to people who think it fantastic and then some that hadnt heard of Ledgers death and interestingly these people gave him about a 6-7/10 for his portrayal of The Joker Whilst Ledger is a great actor and will be sorely missed I think that this being his LAST movie and all the emotion has boosted it up.The same thing happened with James Dean with his blockbuster and last movie Giant. Ledger was a creepy joker and did well to play his part but I think the fact that he was dead made people look at him all throughout the movie and not other actors. Good Move RIP Heath Ledger, a sad loss to the industry	1
I think its adorable that certain members of an unspecified generation find The Dark Knight (aka Batman 2) to be a Masterpiece of Contemporary Cinema. Is adorable the right word? Christian Bale reprises his role as the humorless comic-book hero and Heath Ledger joins the cast as the humorless comic-book villain ironically named Joker. Ledgers Joker is about as much fun as an emergency spleenectomy, which means to say he never laughs, never makes anyone laugh, and never jokes. Are we having fun yet? The film takes place in the same Gotham City from the previous film: flat, bleak, black, dark, foreboding, menacing, pessimistic, intense, sinister, colorless, numb, petrified... is this the fun part? Bale- an otherwise fascinating actor- manages to create a black hole as both Bruce Wayne AND Batman, leaving the audience without any protagonist for whom to cheer. Christopher Nolans solemn direction is the same as in the first- hes working so hard to convince us that all of this is ABSOLUTELY REAL that there is no chance for any fun. Fun in a superhero movie? I must be out of my mind.Whats sad is that poor Heath Ledger took the role of Actual Psychotic so seriously that it contributed to the mans death. No film role is worth your life, and if playing the villain in a comic book movie messes with your mind, youre doing it wrong. No offense to the late actor- whose performance here would have been great in a dramatic or psychological film- but Jack Nicholson nailed The Joker in 89. It was nice of the Academy to give Ledger the posthumous Oscar, but I think we all would have preferred he not die before his time.This is not to say the movie is terrible... its still an above-average action flick with some nice moments: the sunset prison transfer is beautifully done and the scenes at Waynes cocktail party border on subversive, but the generally dour approach to the popcorn-flick leaves me depressed, and I cant help returning to the thought that a man gave his life for this...Maybe thats what certain members of an unspecified generation want... maybe the Imagination is so damaged they dont believe a movie character is killed unless an actor really dies. I find the death of creative thought rather frightening, and I keep coming back to an old horror catchphrase: Its only a movie, Its only a movie... GRADE: C	1
The Dark Knight was probably the best action film Ive ever seen. Not only is the design, tone, special FX, sound, and music all were excellent; but the script was dense, complex, and thorough. The performances from the actors were all very good, particularly Ledger, who took the Joker into a realm of sociopath that weve not seen in a batman character before. This may be Ledgers best performance from his all too short career.The only issue I have is the extreme grossness and goriness of the Two-Face make up/special FX. I think it goes a bit too far to have little bits of flesh dangling from his visible bone structure (The only thing I believe that was better from the previous Bat Mans series). But, the director doesnt use too much face time on that character, so the look remains shocking and not overdone.Certainly The Dark Knight will stand out for quite some time as the best comic book movie, as it has that as its roots. However, it may also stand as a masterpiece in its own right.	10
Ive felt moved to comment on this movie if only to provide some much needed balance to the string of 10 out of 10s being awarded. My real rating would be about 7/10 but I cant stand seeing this up at number 4 on the top 250 list , it wouldnt make my top 100! The plot was confusing and ludicrous throughout.The moral dilemma of the two ferries at the end really spoilt the movie for me. Why werent the passengers diving off the boats and swimming for it ? would both boats (especially one full of ex-cons) really have taken the morally high decision to choose death to save the others ? Some great scenes, special effects, cinematography, lighting, dark mood etc. Brilliant performance by Heath Ledger but overall the plot let this film down.	1
