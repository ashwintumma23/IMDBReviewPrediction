Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	Texas	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. <br><br>The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.<br><br>I didn&#x27;t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don&#x27;t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, &#x22;Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.&#x22; At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.<br><br>No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.<br><br>The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it&#x27;s technical merits - I don&#x27;t really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. 
Shawshank Redeems Hollywood	Paducah, KY	 Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art?  To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process.  Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus.  Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption.  Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood.  The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.<br><br>The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover.  After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.  He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him.  His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding.  Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison.  Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him.  Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.<br><br>By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.  Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.  In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature.  Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.<br><br>While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does.  He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman.  Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue.  Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition.  His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995.  While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.<br><br>With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with.  The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film.  While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles.  Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen.  Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead.  Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.<br><br>With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom.  These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story.  Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.  Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience.  Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think.  He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.<br><br>This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich&eacute;s and predictability.  Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.  The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film.  It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.  
Prepare to be moved	Westerville, Ohio	 I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.<br><br>It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.<br><br>Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie. 
A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.	Vancouver, Canada	In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were &quot;just happy to be nominated.&quot; Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word &quot;go,&quot; making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.<br><br>After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on &quot;that 'Rickshaw' movie.&quot; Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, &quot;it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale.&quot; But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.<br><br>Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; &quot;In here's where you need it most,&quot; he says. &quot;You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.&quot; Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking &quot;that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass&quot; as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.<br><br>It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.<br><br>With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.<br><br>OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, &quot;It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying.&quot; 
Two movies in one	Chicago, IL	The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.  I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.  However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne? 
The best story ever told on film	None	 I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.<br><br>Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with &quot;Red&quot; (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....<br><br>I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.<br><br>But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: &quot;Get busy watching, or get busy dying.&quot; Take his advice.<br><br>Thoroughly recommended. 
The Shawshank Redemption	Marietta, OH	 One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.<br><br>He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people &quot;will&quot; be talking about in 50 or 100 years. 
Powerful	Houston, Texas	 One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising &quot;twist&quot; near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once. 
Stephen King&#39;s best adapted movie	Toronto, Ontario	Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.<br><br>This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won&#39;t be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I&#39;m sure it could be number 1. So I&#39;ll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.<br><br>King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. <br><br>What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don&#39;t know if there will again.<br><br>I&#39;m not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come. 
Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.	Long Island, NY	 The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.<br><br>Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.<br><br>If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10 
This is How Movies Should Be Made	Queens, New York	This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.<br><br>Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd &quot;Red&quot; Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red&#39;s group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been &quot;institutionalized&quot;. <br><br>The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. <br><br>Whatever you do, don&#39;t listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want. 
Simply known as &quot;The Movie&quot;	Madison, WI	 Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as &quot;The Movie&quot;.  When I say &quot;The Movie&quot;, my friends know exactly what I'm talking about.  In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption.  Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those &quot;Budget Theaters&quot; over the summer of 1995.  None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good.  So, not having any real expectations, we saw it.  When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said &quot;That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!&quot; There's really no other way I can put it in words.  Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... &quot;HOPE&quot;.  This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time.  I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history!  How it all just &quot;comes together&quot; is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a &quot;must buy&quot; for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see.  I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films.  However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, &quot;That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!&quot;  There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my &quot;favorite of all time&quot;, but they've all fallen far short of &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;. So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately.  You're guaranteed to find it in the &quot;employee picks&quot; section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them.  If you have seen this movie, go see it again.  If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating???  I give it a 13!!!!!!<br><br> 
Don't Rent Shawshank.	United States	I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.<br><br>Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in &quot;The Shawshank Redemption;&quot; when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. <br><br>Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. <br><br>How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. <br><br>Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. <br><br>But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title. 
Some birds aren&#x27;t meant to be caged.	United Kingdom	The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis &#x22;Red&#x22; Redding (Freeman) . While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.<br><br>There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn&#x27;t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about-and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, tho, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.<br><br>It&#x27;s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that&#x27;s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) &#x26; Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it&#x27;s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.<br><br>Those in support aren&#x27;t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the &#x22;Birdman Of Shawshank,&#x22; Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood &#x26; Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there&#x27;s Roger Deakins&#x27; lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman&#x27;s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy&#x27;s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.<br><br>If you love Shawshank then it&#x27;s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions-anger-revilement-happiness-sadness-inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, tho, Shawshank offers hope; not just for characters in a movie, but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10 
Great story, wondrously told and acted	United States	At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the &#x22;only&#x22; guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn&#x27;t win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.<br><br>But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.<br><br>It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words &#x22;His judgment cometh and that right soon.&#x22; The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.<br><br>Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled &#x22;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.&#x22; Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven&#x27;t seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy&#x27;s wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It&#x27;s the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy&#x27;s wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.<br><br>Frank Darabont&#x27;s direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can&#x27;t cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red&#x27;s periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.<br><br>The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there&#x27;s not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the &#x22;sisters,&#x22; etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the &#x22;redemption&#x22; is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.<br><br>All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.<br><br>Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don&#x27;t miss it.<br><br>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book &#x22;Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can&#x27;t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!&#x22; Get it at Amazon!) 
Busy dying or busy living?	The asylum for the confused and befuddled	 **Yes, there are SPOILERS here**<br><br>This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.<br><br>So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.<br><br>Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.<br><br>Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.<br><br>In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.<br><br>It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.<br><br>The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.<br><br>This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.<br><br>The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.<br><br>So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one.<br><br> 
A movie revolution upon all others	Amman, Jordan	We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.<br><br>This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn&#39;t give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it&#39;s simply over qualified! 
The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced	United States	This touching and heart warming film is the most perfect celebration of the human spirit I have seen. Andy Dufresne, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, finds the strength not only to change himself, but to bring hope to those around him in Shawshank Prison.  This inspiring story is interwoven with a soundtrack which invokes every emotion, from haunting and chilling, to stirring and beautiful. When you go to see a movie and it touches you with its poetry, music, and its atmosphere, and leaves you with a sense of victorious satisfaction, it is a triumph.  Field of Dreams was the first movie which invoked these emotions in me.  Shawshank Redemption is even more powerful for its simplicity.  It doesn't pretend to be clean, nor could it be called a family movie.  It is brutal and violent at times, horrifying and sickening at others. However the title says it all. Redemption is what this story is all about.  And it is not necessarily redemption for the actual crimes you might have committed, but it is redemption for the way you have lived your life.  What emerges can only be called a maginificent piece of art.  This is what movies were meant to be.  
One of the best movies ever made?	Lithuania	Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can&#39;t match the film. When I sow this movie I thought &quot;thats it, this is it, best movie ever&quot;. Sure you can find people who didn&#39;t like it, and when I ask &quot;why&quot;, and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don&#39;t like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can&#39;t find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don&#39;t like ratio &quot;9,2&quot;, they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge... 
Good , But It Is Overrated By Some	Isle Of Bute, Scotland	 In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high <br><br>!!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!<br><br>What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? <br><br>Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? <br><br>There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s score<br><br>I gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters 
Relentless Storytelling	Virginia Beach	 I reviewed this film recently with a specific question in mind. At this writing, this film is ranked by IMDB viewers as the second best film ever made. The SECOND BEST EVER MADE!<br><br>Why? This was my question.<br><br>The acting is good. Robbins and Freeman are quality craftsmen in the Caine and Hackman tradition. But these are not truly great actors and in any case, they are only asked to play appealing persons, deliberately less-dimensional than real (as opposed to believably hyper-real which is much harder).<br><br>The director is a first-timer, and it shows. There is simple framing and staging here. In fact, there seems to be a deliberate strategy to be as plain as possible. And that is the core of where I think people find the appeal of this film.<br><br>The story is very tight in the sense of narrative flow. All the chunks are the same size, with no fancy rhythm. There is no distracting backstory. No element has irony, not writing, acting, shooting, even the score.<br><br>Now for me, I expect and demand art in my films -- that's why I register this as plain. But I think it is well liked because it is totally without pretense. It is straight and honest; people seem hungry for honesty, and this has the appearance of what they need at just the right time.<br><br>Is a film great because it merely fulfills? I hope many people think not, and dream that this film moves down the list to be replaced with more intelligent efforts. 
life changing	United Kingdom	I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life 
Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time	Canada	When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought &#x22;Yea, I could understand that&#x22;. I don&#x27;t necessarily agree that it&#x27;s absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.<br><br>It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. <br><br>It&#x27;s funny, because I don&#x27;t really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.<br><br>And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I&#x27;d pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it&#x27;s spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it&#x27;s story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it&#x27;s the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. <br><br>Stephen King&#x27;s novella &#x22;Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption&#x22; was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn&#x27;t use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can&#x27;t help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. <br><br>If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It&#x27;s one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.<br><br>An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10. 
The Shawshank Redemption	Viet Nam	A friend of mine listed &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in front of the TV (a melodrama doesn&#39;t kill, right?)<br><br>I don&#39;t know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times, being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before.<br><br>Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it&#39;s about life-changing experiences, about the endless struggle against life&#39;s harshness and unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.<br><br>Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was nominated, but it&#39;s all about struggling against unfairness, time&#39;s proved its monumental magnitude.<br><br>Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150 minutes. 
A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.	Fort Collins, Colorado	This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away. 
Movie you can see 1000 times	India	I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.<br><br>its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole storyline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life.<br><br>Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail, Morgon Freeman says &#x22;I have to remind myself that some birds aren&#x27;t meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright&#x22; This movie has entertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short everything we want to see in a movie.<br><br>I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life 
Simply Perfect	United Kingdom	Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.<br><br>I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.<br><br>Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there. 
An excellent film contained within a classic	United States	When I first saw the Shawshank Redemption, I was in a movie theater on a week night at around 11pm. I had gotten out of work from working the evening shift. I was tired and just wanted a little amusement. This was at a time after Shawshank had been released but got little attention. I had heard some Oscar buzz so my curiosity got the better of me. I half reluctantly chose to watch it. That night, I was not prepared to be blown away. I didn&#x27;t see a movie, I was transported by a story. I was instantly transcended into realizing why films should be made to begin with. I wasn&#x27;t just entertained, I was emotionally moved and intellectually bamboozled in the most endearing manner. If this film remains on IMDb&#x27;s number one spot for a long time to come, It&#x27;s well deserves it. To me personally, the Shawshank Redemption is a testament as to why the 90&#x27;s were an interesting decade but more than that, why a film can become an experience and gain instant classic status. There are two simple rules you should follow prior to watching T S R: one, if you haven&#x27;t seen it, don&#x27;t let any one who HAS seen it tell you anything about its plot, Don&#x27;t listen to a word caus they might ruin it for you. Two, make arrangements not to be interrupted when watching the film; no phone calls, no door bells, no other plans. Watch it from beginning to end. You can&#x27;t over hype this film it&#x27;s just that good. What i&#x27;ve written here is just a small fraction of what I can further express by way of praise for the film. Long live The Shawshank Redemption on IMDb ! 
Are you serious??	Birmingham, England	 Sorry folks, but can this film really be (one of) the greatest of all time? Entertaining? Yes. Well acted? Err...yes.  'Life affirming'? No way. Realistic? Don't make me laugh.<br><br>Twenty years or so pass in this film. Does anybody get any older? Apart from the occasional pair of specs, that's it. Not an extra wrinkle to be seen. What happened to the make-up department?<br><br>People get beaten to within an inch of their lives. One death and one wheelchair case, but otherwise just a couple of bruises which disappear rapidly.<br><br>The 'baddies' get their just deserts and we're all supposed to shout 'serve them right' (as we say in England). The 'goodies' live happily ever after, but we knew that would happen within the first ten minutes. The people who think this is a great film probably think Stephen King is a great author. Competent and popular...yes. Great...no!! P.S. Who replaced the poster after...? Was that an oak tree? Maybe leaves are a different shape in America. 
&#x22;I&#x27;m a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning&#x22;.	United States	Well I guess I&#x27;m a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I&#x27;ve seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I&#x27;ve come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like &#x22;On The Waterfront&#x22;, &#x22;To Kill a Mockingbird&#x22; and &#x22;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&#x22;. I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don&#x27;t mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.<br><br>Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it&#x27;s pretty clich&#xE9; to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen&#x27;s release and new prisoner Tommy&#x27;s introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy&#x27;s quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man&#x27;s confinement for a crime he didn&#x27;t commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967&#x27;s &#x22;Cool Hand Luke&#x22;, but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.<br><br>But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that &#x27;hope can drive a man insane&#x27;.<br><br>I really can&#x27;t recommend this picture highly enough, both for it&#x27;s masterful story telling and it&#x27;s technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that&#x27;s virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance. 
The shortest long movie I've ever seen. Kept me wanting more and more, minute by minute.	Oslo, Norway	 At first, before starting the movie, I thought &quot;Sounds like a typical prison riot and break-out kind of movie&quot;. At the beginning of the movie, my thoughts was even more convincing. A large prison (Which immediately reminded me of the movie &quot;The Last Castle&quot; from 2001), housing people of all sorts, having it's guards, warden and of course, the inmates. The typical inmate; Roughneck, hard on the outside, broken on the inside. And they all claim their innocence, as an internal joke sort of speak.<br><br>It gets to a point where I started comparing it with others. That proved wrong in quite a short while, from the point where a prisoner, framed for murder of his wife and her lover, is being convicted and sentenced to life in prison. His name was Andy Dufresne. In short terms, a straight-up bank employee, excellent with numbers and taxes, which he also uses to benefit within the walls of the prison. His reputation as a numerological genius spreads out, and soon all kinds of people, inmates and guards, are coming to him for financial advice. He builds up a library, he maintains a strict surface. He has his hobbies, to keep his mind busy (as said in the movie). He carves chess pieces out of stone, using an axe as the tool. Seemingly, this is a nice and lucrative hobby, but underneath it all, he has a secret...<br><br>The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play. The crew really did good work on the set, the right camera angles, the light, sounds and so on...it was almost like I could smell the prison!<br><br>A brilliant movie. Not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching! My highest recommendation for those who like drama, action and humor. 
Best of all time!!!	India	This is the best movie I have ever seen. In a way I feel I am in a prison of life myself. Restricted to doing certain things. Sometimes I get frustrated and feel as I should runaway to some place where I could feel free. I hope and dream for it sometime. This movie just reminds me of my feelings so much. I love Andy Dufresne most in this movie. Although critics say Tim Robbins didn&#x27;t do enough to express the character but my personal opinion is that he was made for this role.<br><br>I can go on and say more but I said the most important thing which I feel whenever I watch it.<br><br>I am glad to visit IMDb. I never heard of it before. Some 7 years ago I saw it at no.2 in the rankings and decided to watch it immediately. Only other movie which even comes close to this is Citizen Kane. But that is about past and this one is about hope and freedom.<br><br>I give it 11/10. 
For the first time the Movie defeats the Book!	Bangladesh	As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.<br><br>But Believe me...this is not the case of The Shawshank Redemption...which I rate as the best movie I have ever seen.For the first time in history the book(the Stephen King Novella) has been defeated by its movie version.After watching the movie I was crazy about reading the book....I thought wow!the movie is so good...how will be the book!!To tell U frankly,the book is good, but the movie is best.There are some unforgettable scenes in the movie which were not in the book.Some examples are: The scene when Andy locks up the guard and play the opera on the microphone.The narration goes on like..&quot;I didn&#39;t understand a single word that Italian lady was singing...but I tell U..for that single second every soul in the Shawshank prison felt free...&quot;The scene just fill my heart with Andy&#39;s yearn for freedom...I was kinda shocked when I didn&#39;t find it in the original book version.<br><br>I can remember another scene.While Andy creates the prison library and starts listing books sent to prison from charity organizations...a fellow inmate tries to read a name on the book...Alexandre Dumas as &quot;Dumb-Ass&quot;. Andy says....&quot;its not Dumb-ass...its Dumas..and U may like the book..The Count of Monty Cristo...its about a jailbreak.And the category it falls is Fiction&quot; Then Red says..&quot;Why don&#39;t we put it on Educational category?&quot;(Right before Andy listed an engineering handbook as &quot;Educational&quot; category).As Count of Monticristo is one of my favorite books, I was hysteric watching this sophisticated joke.This was also not in the book.<br><br>This DVD is my favorite gift I give my friends. And after they watch it....they always thank me . Like many other IMDb friends commenting on this movie..I would also like to say..&quot;Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen in my life&quot;.Thanx to all. 
Very enjoyable, but let's not go overboard, folks	Seattle, Washington	 THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is very enjoyable, features excellent performances, and has won a fanatical following among a lot of people.  I just saw it.  I liked it.  But as for becoming fanatically enthusiastic about it, all I can say is, folks, let's not get carried away...<br><br>The story not only is incredibly *simple* (good man unjustly convicted for horrible crime maintains hope in horrible confinement), but is also incredibly *simplistic* (the Warden and his men are evil goons, the convicts are good).  Complexity is something completely exiled from this story.<br><br>The director, Frank Durabont, offers nothing new in his aesthetic choices -- SHAWSHANK is stock Hollywood filmmaking, especially of the Spielbergian variety ala THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD.  The soundtrack is overpowering in its efforts to imbue the story with &quot;heartwrenching emotion.&quot;  The cinematography is fine in a sort-of standard-issue, &quot;seen it before&quot; way.<br><br>Which begs the question:  Is there anything truly *exceptional* about THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION?  Heck yeah -- Morgan Freeman proves, once again, that he is not only a wonderful actor but also one of the most endearing, powerful presences in cinema.  Tim Robbins is fine, along with all of the convicts.<br><br>But overall, I didn't mistake THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION for anything particularly new, remarkable, exciting -- in other words, as anything worthy of fanatical enthusiasm.  It's a fine Hollywood film that looks, smells, sounds and feels like your typical fine Hollywood film.  But nothing more. 
What More Can I Say?	United Kingdom	There are only a handful of films that have shaken me to my core and continued to resonate with me for very long after their first viewing. I can happily say that &#x22;The Shawshank Redemption&#x22; has stuck to me since I finished watching it for the first time, and instantly rocketed up my Top 10 Films list. <br><br>Most great films have one or two obvious flaws that can be easily picked out - not so in &#x22;Shawshank&#x22;, at least not to me. The hefty run time doesn&#x27;t put me off because the story and characters are just so well rounded and so easy to return to time and time again. <br><br>&#x22;Shawshank&#x22; is one of those films that I would love to experience for the first time all over again. The thrill of emotions and the highs and lows I felt that first time are incomparable to much else. <br><br>In my opinion, &#x22;Forrest Gump&#x22; was not as deserving of the Best Picture Oscar as this. The timeless feel of a story of friendship in a hopeless place will likely continue to capture generations of people for years to come. 
Brilliant &#x26; Excellent	United Kingdom	By far the best movie ever...<br><br>No Doubt this is the best ever movie you will ever see, It is easily the best movie of my life-time so far.<br><br>Morgan Free is a legend and Rest of the Crew did a marvellous job as well. Well written / narrated and directed movie of all times.<br><br>10 out 10.<br><br>It has been on number one ranking on IMDb and most of the other movie rating websites forever now.<br><br>The best past of the movie is narrated voice by Morgan Freeman.<br><br>The character Andy Dufrain is a very well composed and the Warden character has lot of punch into it.<br><br>Escape from prison was the best it can ever get.<br><br>Marvellous piece of Art. 
A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ...	France	I will never forget the first time I watched &#x22;The Shawshank Redemption&#x22;, with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film &#x22;with the poster&#x22; was.<br><br>Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn&#x27;t justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn&#x27;t do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone &#x22;The Godfather&#x22; from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it&#x27;s only justice if &#x22;The Shawshank Redemption&#x22;, the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly. <br><br>This is the strength of &#x22;The Shawshank Redemption&#x22;, its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of &#x27;having a life&#x27;. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we&#x27;re literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who&#x27;s like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from &#x22;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&#x22;. And the comparison with Forman&#x27;s film isn&#x27;t fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.<br><br>In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and &#x27;busy&#x27; in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker&#x27;s casket again and feels that prison didn&#x27;t deprive him from his &#x27;social quality&#x27;. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. <br><br>And the film&#x27;s motto, on which relies its philosophical core is &#x22;Get busy living or get busy dying&#x22;. Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it&#x27;s all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn&#x27;t live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn&#x27;t help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont&#x27;s film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is &#x22;The Shawshank Redemption&#x22;<br><br>In the same vein than &#x22;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&#x22;, &#x22;Shawshank&#x22; is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : &#x22;Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose.&#x22; This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.<br><br>&#x22;The Shawshank Redemption&#x22; a powerful adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity. 
The Story of Friendship and Hope...	Turkey	Maybe I&#x27;m writing a review too late for this movie, but I think I must write something for this.<br><br>Shawshank Redemption is a truly A Class movie that teaches us many things like friendship and never gave up your hope. Unlike other users, I think this movie deserves to be in IMDb Top 250 list. Today, IMDb&#x27;s Top 250 List approved and considered by everyone. So, everybody must see that this movie is in top and must watch it to see why IMDb puts this movie on top and not Godfather.<br><br>I really like the role of Red by Morgan Freeman. He really acts like a experienced jail-mate. Andy Dufresne is okay too.<br><br>What I really like is that, I really love the end. Maybe this is the best ending ever. I really like how Red laughs to Andy about pickaxe and Andy dig 19 years ( WOW !) to made a hole in the wall, how he escape and become a person he made it up for Warden&#x27;s dirty job, how his dreams come true and lastly after 5 years in jail after Andy escaped, how Red not decided to suicide, decided to follow Andy.<br><br>Best Movie Ever...<br><br>10/10 
This movie is for every man	United States	There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I don&#x27;t care what anyone&#x27;s take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation. 
Extraordinary	United States	 An analysis of prison life--and of what hope can be in a prison--Frank Darabont's first film is one of the best ever.  Well-written and well-acted, the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming, endearing, poignant.  Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous--it's simply extraordinary drama. 
A great film, but #2?	Oldham, Gtr Manchester, England.	A great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?<br><br>One user put it very well when they said that the film&#39;s essential message of &#39;the human spirit conquering all&#39; is very uplifting an&#39; everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.<br><br>There are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan&#39;s &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What&#39;s even more heartening is that it&#39;s also true.<br><br>Like I said, I&#39;m not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what&#39;s new?), the direction is perfect because it&#39;s so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it&#39;s nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?<br><br>I gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!<br><br>I think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can&#39;t agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.<br><br>#2 of 250? I don&#39;t think it would make it into my top 50 films.<br><br>Ah well, life&#39;s all about opinions... 
As succinct as I can be	London	 Occasionally you go into a cinema and all the films you wanted to see were full. As you've come this far and you're a bit of a film fan you go to see a film you've heard nothing about. I did this 6 years ago, with expectations low and a boredom threshold to match I sat and waited to be disappointed. 2 hours later I walked out of the cinema a different person, before I had not been moved by a film, I didn't care if : Indiana Jones made it, Sonny Corleone got wacked, Fred married Ginger, ET got home. Before, films were either plot driven or character driven, they were action or comedy, sad or happy, a few came along that combined a number of facets that I enjoyed, respected  or challenged how I viewed an issue or a person.<br><br>Shawshank was different, there were characters I believed, not just one or two but virtually all. Throughout the first hour I was gripped the full range of emotions were explored, the second hour building on the characters was even more powerful, some characters came and went but ultimately this was a story of 2 people: Red and Andy. I have never seen a film that so eloquently and beautifully illustrates friendship and hope.<br><br>This has become the benchmark by which I judge all movies. I am pleased that I am not alone in feeling this way. I am glad that it did not win oscars as I feel individual endorsement is stronger than any vested interest award ceremony, I relish telling everyone this is my favourite film. I have seen it many times and will see it many more.<br><br> 
hope is a good thing,, and good things never,,,,,	India	this is the first time i am really wand to write something about this<br><br>movie even though i have watched it a hundred times o so,,,, anyone who really wanna know how a movie should b should watch this one,,,<br><br>movies are medium which should make us think and this one surely does about life,,,<br><br>anyone wanna know the meaning of patience determination this one does the trick for u,,,, <br><br>watch it and be inspired,,,<br><br>thats all i can say,,,<br><br>it will change the way u think about things around u,,<br><br>never let it die in u,,, 
To be seen once every 6 months, for complete revitalisation of Mind and Soul	India	Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.<br><br>* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through 
Absolutely brilliant	Paris, France	 The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.<br><br>Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clich&eacute;s - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.<br><br>Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking. 
What a beautiful movie!	France	 All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really &quot;Red&quot;. Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact. 
one of my absolute favorites!	Boston, MA	 This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once.  Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you! 
The absolute GREATEST movie of all time.	Hamilton, Ontario	 My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, &quot;redemption&quot;, and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.<br><br>As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.<br><br>This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life.  
Very Cool!!!	Chihuahua, Chih.	 Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them &quot;The Woman In The Room&quot;, directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it? 
This is a film that you live, not watch	Manchester, England	 To call The Shawshank Redemption a great film would be doing it no justice at all. This is a film that when I watched it the first time I couldn't believe how good it was.  I expected a film that would pass the time by, and I got a film that I could identify with.  If you are feeling sad, and you think the world's a rubbish place, this fills you with hope.  I love the opening scene where the camera pans around the prison, and then the music kicks in, it makes you feel awe-inspired.  <br><br>The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. <br><br>The film and book reciprocated the message 'Hope Springs Eternal', which means so much because we always live in hope that tomorrow it will be better, things might change for us, and hope never dies. <br><br>I think, when Tim Robbins speaks about music, how you can never take it away, because it's in your head.  If I have a rubbish day at work, then it's true that music just lifts you, which is re-emphasised with the scene where he plays the music full blast around the prison (this of example of piece of script, which means, so much). The movie uses music to it's full potential to give more impact to the words and the characters.  <br><br>This film cannot replicated, because the film is a piece of art, the Director wanted to make money, but he also wanted to make a piece of film that made you feel something, that had some effect on you after the movie was over. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you nether been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience.  The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live).  This will live in my memories forever, not like the sorry cash-ins of movies.  <br><br>This is a brief synopsis of how great the movie is, but words just seem so little to explain the brilliance of this film.
